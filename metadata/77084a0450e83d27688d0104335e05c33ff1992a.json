During the '60s and early '70s in particular, every Brown show featured a 15 or 20-minute break when he would leave the stage, turning it over to a young female singer who'd perform her own mini set - an event that became a tradition and an important part of the revue. It is these women who are collected across this marvelous and historically potent two-disc set.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\nThe 60's\n\n\n01.You've Got The Power (With James Brown) - Bea Ford\n02.A Little Taste Of Soul (With The Nat Hendrix Band) - Sugar Pie Desanto\n03.I Found You - Yvonne Fair\n04.If I Knew - Yvonne Fair\n05.You Can Make It If You Try - Yvonne Fair\n06.Straighten Up - Yvonne Fair\n07.Say Yeah Yeah - Yvonne Fair\n08.I Cried - Tammy Montgomery (Tammi Terrell)\n09.If You Don't Think - Tammy Montgomery (Tammi Terrell)\n10.If Somebody Told You - Anna King\n11.Make Up Your Mind - Anna King\n12.Baby Baby Baby (With Bobby Byrd) - Anna King\n13.All Of Me - Elsie Mae\n14.Whole Lot Of Lovin' - Elsie Mae\n15.Do You Really Want To Rescue Me, Part 1 - Elsie Mae\n16.This Is My Story - The Jewels\n17.Wide Awake In A Dream - Vicki Anderson\n18.Baby, Don't You Know - Vicki Anderson\n19.Unwind Yourself - Marva Whitney\n20.I'm Tired, I'm Tired, I'm Tired - Marva Whitney\n21.What Do I Have To Do To Prove My Love To You - Marva Whitney\n22.You Got To Have A Job (With James Brown) - Marva Whitney\n23.It's My Thing (You Can't Tell Me Who To Sock It To) - Marva Whitney\n24.I Made A Mistake Because It's Only You, Parts 1 &amp; 2 - Marva Whitney\n25.Things Got To Get Better (Get Together) - Marva Whitney\n26.Answer To Mother Popcorn (I Got A Mother For You) - Vicki Anderson\n27.I Want To Be In The Land Of Milk And Honey - Vicki Anderson\n\n\nThe 70's\n\n\n01.The Message From The Soul Sisters (Parts 1 &amp; 2) - Vicki Anderson\n02.Super Good (Answer To Super Bad) (Parts 1 &amp; 2) - Vicki Anderson\n03.I'm Too Tough For Mr. Big Stuff (Hot Pants) - Vicki Anderson\n04.Don't Throw Your Love In The Garbage Can - Vicki Anderson\n05.You're Welcome, Stop On By (With Bobby Byrd) - Vicki Anderson\n06.The Lord Will Make A Way Somehow (Parts 1 &amp; 2) - Kay Robinson\n07.People Make The World A Better Place - Shirley Jean &amp; The Relations\n08.Wheel Of Life - Lyn Collins\n09.Think (About It) - Lyn Collins\n10.Me And My Baby Got A Good Thing Going - Lyn Collins\n11.Mama Feelgood - Lyn Collins\n12.Take Me, Just As I Am - Lyn Collins\n13.Don't Make Me Over - Lyn Collins\n14.What My Baby Needs Now Is A Little More Lovin' (With James Brown) - Lyn Collins\n15.We Want To Parrty, Parrty, Parrty (Parts 1 &amp; 2) - Lyn Collins\n16.Rock Me Again &amp; Again &amp; Again... - Lyn Collins\n17.You Can't Love Me, If You Don't Respect Me - Lyn Collins\n18.Put It On The Line - Lyn Collins\n19.Summertime (With James Brown) - Martha High\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77084a0450e83d27688d0104335e05c33ff1992a","amp;dn":"VA+-+James+Brown%5C%27s+Original+Funky+Divas+%281998%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77084a0450e83d27688d0104335e05c33ff1992a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,8,74,4,80,232,61,39,104,141,1,4,51,94,5,195,63,241,153,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
