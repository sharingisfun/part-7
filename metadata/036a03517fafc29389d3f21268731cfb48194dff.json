All of them are up around 100 pages, if not longer. Different source for this batch, and these are not quite as 'clean' and perfect as the first batch. I did do a bit of work on a few of them, but that was mostly making them smaller. Some of them had page dimensions that were 3-4 times too big, which made the files HUGE. I shrunk them all down to my usual 1400 width. Also, one of them was scanned c2c as two-page spreads. I edited that one down to single pages for your viewing pleasure.\n\nNo 3: Neal Adams - The Marvel Years, Ditko on Kirby's Spider-Man, Bob Kane on Bill Finger, Kubert on his Correspondence Course, and more\n\nNo 4: Empire Of Horror - The Warren Publishing Story, James Warren, Archie Goodwin, Angelo Torres, Al Williamson, Alex Toth, Will Eisner, Russ Heath, Bernie Wrightson, Richard Corben\n\nNo 6: The Marvel Bullpen 1970-77, Romita, Severin, Cockrum, Brunner, McGregor, Russell, Sutton, The Prisoner\n\nNo 12: Carlton Comics Of The 1970s, Staton, Cuti, Wildman, Byrne, Sutton, Keller, Statler, Newton, Zeck\n\nNo 18: Cosmic Comics Of The 1970s, Starlin, Engleheart, Weiss, Milgrom Leialoha, Brunner and more\n\nNo 20: Special Father And Sons Issue, In Easy Company With The Kubert's, The Romitas Remember and more\n\nNo 21: Remembering John Buscema, Adam Hughes Bares All\n\n\nThe first batch of Comic Book Artist issues...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7719734/Comic_Book_Artist&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7719734/Comic_Book_Artist&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:036a03517fafc29389d3f21268731cfb48194dff","amp;dn":"Comic+Book+Artist+%28Batch+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"036a03517fafc29389d3f21268731cfb48194dff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,106,3,81,127,175,194,147,137,211,242,18,104,115,28,251,72,25,77,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
