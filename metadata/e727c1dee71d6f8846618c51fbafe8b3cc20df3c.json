Musser, Blake E. Peterson and William F. Burger\nWiley | January 2008 | ISBN-10: 0470105836 | PDF | 1072 pages | 29.3 mb\n\nNow in its eighth edition, this text masterfully integrates skills, concepts, and activities to motivate learning. It emphasises the relevance of mathematics to help students learn the importance of the information being covered. This approach ensures that they develop a sold mathematics foundation and discover how to apply the content in the real world.\nThis leading text covers all the essential mathematics students need for teaching at the elementary and middle school levels. Among its key strengths are its richness in problem- solving strategies, integrity and flow of mathematics, relevance of topics and extensive pedagogy and problem sets. Unlike similar texts that follow a typical &quot;math majors progression,&quot; this text follows the progression of elementary school math curricula considered more suitable for elementary teachers. Another noteworthy feature is the text's emphasis on the NCTM standards; not only does it incorporate the standards in problem sets and discussion, it teaches students the relevance of the standards and how they reflect current research in mathematics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e727c1dee71d6f8846618c51fbafe8b3cc20df3c","amp;dn":"Mathematics+for+Elementary+Teachers+%288th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e727c1dee71d6f8846618c51fbafe8b3cc20df3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,39,193,222,231,29,111,136,70,97,140,81,251,175,232,179,204,32,223,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
