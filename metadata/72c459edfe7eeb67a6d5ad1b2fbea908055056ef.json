Nighthawk influenced a generation of artists including Elmore James, Muddy Waters, B.B. King and particularly Earl Hooker. In many ways Nighthawk was the archetype of the classic bluesman spending his entire adult life rambling all over the South with frequent trips to the North playing a never ending string of one nighters punctuated by sporadic recording dates. Nighthawk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s recording dates brought him only limited success but he remained popular in the South his entire life. Nighthawk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s life remains somewhat indistinct; for one he never stayed in Chicago long enough to establish himself, he was interviewed only briefly and unlike many artists didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t appreciably benefit from the blues boom of the 1960\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s. \n\n\nTracklist:\n01 Black Angel Blues (3:04)\n02 Anna Lee Blues (3:15)\n03 Jackson Town Gal (2:52)\n04 My Sweet Lovin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' Woman (2:51)\n05 Down The Line (2:48 )\n06 Handsome Lover (2:57)\n07 She Knows How To Love A Man (3:07)\n08 Sugar Papa (2:52)\n09 Return Mail Blues (3:16)\n10 Good News (3:15)\n11 Six Three O (2:54)\n12 Prison Bound (2:59)\n13 Sorry My Angel (3:34)\n14 Someday (3:03)\n\n\n\nTracks: 1,2,8 &amp; 9\nRobert Nighthawk (guitar,vocals on 1,2 &amp; 9)\nEthel Mae (vocals track 8 )\nErnest Lane (piano)\nWillie Dixon (bass)\n\nRecorded 12 September 1948 )\n\nTracks 3,10-12\nRobert Nighthawk (guitar, vocals on 3,11 &amp; 12)\nEthel Mae (vocals track 10)\nPinetop Perkins (piano)\nWillie Dixon (bass)\n\nRecorded  5 January 1950\n\nTracks 4-6\nRobert Nighthawk (guitar,vocals on tr 5)\nEthel Mae (vocals 0n 4&amp; 5)\nErnest Lane (piano)\nWillie Dixon (bass)\n\nRecorded 18 November 1948\n\nTracks 13-14\nRobert Nighthawk (guitar,vocals)\nWalter  Horton (harmonica)\nLafeyette Leake (piano)\nBuddy Guy (guitar)\nJack Mayers (bass)\nClifton James (drums)\n\nRecorded 30 June 1964\n\nAll tracks recorded in Chicago IL.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72c459edfe7eeb67a6d5ad1b2fbea908055056ef","amp;dn":"Robert+Nighthawk++Sweet+Black+Angel%28blues%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72c459edfe7eeb67a6d5ad1b2fbea908055056ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,196,89,237,254,126,235,103,166,213,173,27,47,190,169,8,5,80,86,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
