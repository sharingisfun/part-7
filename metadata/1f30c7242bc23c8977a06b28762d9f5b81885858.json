They've been spitting stuff out like first time swallowers this past year. Next one up is Secret Society I guess.\nNow, don't get me wrong... I love Necro (really, I wouldn't have evolved the way I did musicwise if it wasn't for &quot;I Need Drugs&quot; and &quot;Gory Days&quot;). But if you ask me he's lost it. Necro's latest, The Pre-Fix for Death, had nothing but a few descent tracks, and only one that was actually good (Reflection of Children Coming Up in the Grave). And he keeps fucking things up on this one. I mean, what's with the metal? That's just wrong on so many levels... But maybe it's just me.\nAnyway, it's still worth the download for the more basic tracks.\n\nLable: Psycho+Logical Records\nYear: 2005\nProduced by: Necro\n\nRipped from the retail CD with a bitrate of 320Kbps.\n\nTracklist:\n 1. The Chosen Few\n 2. Theatre of Creeps\n 3. Carnivores\n 4. South of Heaven\n 5. Tyrrannical\n 6. The Four Horsemen\n 7. Take it in Blood\n 8. Necrotura\n 9. The Ultimate Revenge\n10. Severed Organs\n11. Joe Spinneli\n12. Fender Rhodes Suicide\n13. The Black Wings of Apocalypse\n\nI'll seed this as much as I can for as long as it's needed. But I only have about 55kbps upload, so everyone's more than welcome to help out with the seeding. This is my first torrent, so I'd like to see that everything works out...\n\nBtw, I heard they got Howie to quit heroin! Did he die, or what...?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f30c7242bc23c8977a06b28762d9f5b81885858","amp;dn":"Circle+of+Tyrants+CD+%28Necro%2C+Goretex%2C+Ill+Bill+%26+Mr.+Hyde%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f30c7242bc23c8977a06b28762d9f5b81885858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,48,199,36,43,194,60,137,119,160,107,40,118,45,159,91,129,136,88,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
