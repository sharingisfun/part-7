The one caveat is you need basic music reading skills, but given these, the book provides a clear and unintimidating way into beginning to work on any style covered in it.\n\nWithout sugarcoating the amount of work it will take to get really good at it, he gives you the tools to start working on songs immediately and refers you to materials for further study, both books and recordings by other artists. He also sprinkles much wisdom and insight in tips about the process and experience of self-teaching.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aff3e14e78743da60931c643d89ed8ef967324b9","amp;dn":"Bill+Hilton+-+How+to+Really+Play+the+Piano+%282009%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aff3e14e78743da60931c643d89ed8ef967324b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,243,225,78,120,116,61,166,9,49,198,67,216,158,216,239,150,115,36,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
