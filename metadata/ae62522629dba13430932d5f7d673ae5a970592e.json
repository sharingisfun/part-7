Imperious, headstrong, and vain, MacArthur matched an undeniable military genius with a massive ego and a rebellious streak that often seemed to destine him for the dustbin of history. Yet despite his flaws, MacArthur is remembered as a brilliant commander whose combined-arms operation in the PacificÃ¢â‚¬â€the first in the history of warfareÃ¢â‚¬â€secured AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s triumph in World War II and changed the course of history. \n\n In The Most Dangerous Man in America, celebrated historian Mark Perry examines how this paradox of a man overcame personal and professional challenges to lead his countrymen in their darkest hour. As Perry shows, Franklin Roosevelt and a handful of MacArthurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subordinates made this feat possible, taming MacArthur, making him useful, and finally making him victorious. A gripping, authoritative biography of the Pacific TheaterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most celebrated and misunderstood commander, The Most Dangerous Man in America reveals the secrets of Douglas MacArthurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s successÃ¢â‚¬â€and the incredible efforts of the men who made it possible.
