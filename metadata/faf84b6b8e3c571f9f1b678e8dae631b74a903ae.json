She's so driven she runs for Congress to advance the cause of education reform. Hannah's not a likable candidate, though; her elitism turns off Boston voters, big-time.\n \nHannah and her business partner, Colleen Pickering (Camryn Manheim) don't give up easily. Next election, they recruit a candidate Ã¢â‚¬â€œ beer vendor Elliot Doolittle (David Walton) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who definitely is a man-of-the-people. His mother Allie (Frances Fisher) is the definition of &quot;piece of work,&quot; as is his sister Allie (Georgia Lyman).\n \nElliot Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whose thick South Boston accent masks considerable intelligence Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is the polar opposite of prim-and-proper Hannah.\n \nHannah takes Elliot on as a &quot;project.&quot; Pygmalion-like (modern day), if she can just teach him to speak like gentleman, dress like a gentleman, comport himself like a gentleman .. why he might become a gentleman, a gentleman who can run for Congress Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and win. Elliot and Hannah are about as oil-and-water as two people can be. But as Elliot becomes more &quot;presentable&quot; and Hannah becomes less &quot;proper,&quot; could this be a match made in electoral Heaven?\n \n\nCast: \n\nJulia Stiles ...
