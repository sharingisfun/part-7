Dr. John Cukrowicz (Montgomery Clift) is a gifted Chicago brain surgeon stymied by the primitive operating conditions at the New Orleans asylum where he works. Society matron Violet Venable (Hepburn) offers a solution in the form of a million-dollar grant -- as long as Cukrowicz will treat her niece, Catherine (Taylor). Catherine, it seems, has been institutionalized since the sudden death of her cousin, Violet's son, Sebastian, overseas the previous summer. As the young doctor tries to get to the bottom of what happened to Catherine, Violet's steely demeanor and devotion to Sebastian present a formidable barrier. Catherine herself doesn't offer much help, her recollections jumbled by medication and the trauma of Sebastian's demise. Under pressure to seal the deal and cut into Catherine's brain, Cukrowicz's principles (and attraction to the young woman) prevent him from proceeding until he uncovers what actually happened to Sebastian. In his memoirs, Gore Vidal claims to have written the screenplay for Suddenly, Last Summer  single-handedly, although Williams took half the credit. Vidal toned down the original play's allusions to pedophilia, cannibalism, and incest, but the film nonetheless provoked heated controversy. As for the cast, an unhappy Hepburn reportedly was threatened by the attention lavished on Taylor by director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, whom Hepburn had hired to produce The Philadelphia Story  two decades earlier. Mankiewicz, for his part, allegedly hated Clift, whose drinking and partial paralysis from an auto accident prevented him from working more than half a day at a time. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Suddenly, Last Summer.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.35 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 49mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 767 Kbps\n      Writing library : VirtualDub build 32661/release\n      Copyright : HeDgEhOtÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 49mn\n      Bit rate : 1 630 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.241\n      Stream size : 1.25 GiB (92%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 49mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 100 MiB (7%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 504 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053318/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053318/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by zoneyoutwonk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:339584325589be304dc11132fea541597a2bf073","amp;dn":"Suddenly%2C+Last+Summer+%281959%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"339584325589be304dc11132fea541597a2bf073","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,149,132,50,85,137,190,48,77,193,17,50,254,165,65,89,122,43,240,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
