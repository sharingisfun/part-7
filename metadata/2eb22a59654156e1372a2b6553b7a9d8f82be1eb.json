It's a challenge to stay in sync with the fast-paced world of TV and video today. Networking schemes, compression technology, computing systems, equipment, and standards are all but a few of the things that seem to change monthly. As the field transitions from analog to hybrid analog/digital to all-digital broadcast networks, stations, video video production facilities, and success-minded engineers and technicians stay up to speed with the only reference tracking all the changes in the field: the &quot;Standard Handbook of Video and Television Engineering&quot;.No other source covers such a broad range of video and television technology - with an emphasis on practical applications. Whether you work in design, production, installation, operation, or maintenance of video centers and broadcast stations, &quot;Standard Handbook of Video and Television Engineering&quot; gives you easy-to-find answers on: video networking technologies; digital television and data broadcast standards; digital technologies for production, transport, and storage of video and audio signals; digital video formats and production considerations; implementation recommendations and practices for DTV; video pickup and display devices and systems; compression technologies for audio and video; production facility design guidelines; fundamental principles of light and vision; extensive reference documentation; and much more.Covering everything from basic principles and formulae to dissections of the latest equipment and FCC mandates, the Handbook includes more than 70 topically organized, fully indexed, articles - over 1200 pages, written by dozens of the field's foremost experts. What's more, the accompanying CD includes a compendium of standards, critical background information, in-depth technical material, and high-resolution test images. This leading-edge resource defines today's video electronics, pulling together wisdom from the entire scope of television technology to deliver a truly useful, field-encompassing volume selected by more professionals than any other. Why not make the &quot;Standard Handbook of Video and Television Engineering&quot; your choice, too? \n\nNo other source covers such a broad range of video and television technology--with an emphasis on practical applications.
