The series is primarily based on Tensou Sentai Goseiger. The sequel Power Rangers Super Megaforce started airing in February 2014.\n\n&quot;Our world was once a safe and happy place until evil aliens arrived with one plan: to destroy Earth. Gosei, Earth's ancient guardian, awoke and called on a new team of teenagers to fight off this new threat. They are the Power Rangers Megaforce.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€¢Narrator\n\nMegaforce features Gosei, a supernatural being who has protected the earth for centuries with his robotic assistant, Tensou. But when the evil Warstar aliens begin their massive invasion, Gosei calls upon five teenagers with attitude to form the ultimate team...The Power Rangers Megaforce!\n\nWhen the teens morph into Power Rangers, they gain superhuman strength, agility, and mastery over martial arts. In addition to defending earth against the Warstar aliens, other monstrous factions emerge to challenge the Mega Rangers. Under the leadership of a malevolent alien, toxic beasts rise from their slimy underground lair to attack the Earth and a ruthless robot army launches an offensive from their deep sea compound. In order to face these new threats, the Power Rangers Megaforce unlock powerful battle modes to fight their adversaries.\n\nPower Rangers Super Megaforce is the 21st season of Power Rangers continuing the celebration of the series 20th anniversary. The series is based on Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger, though some elements remain from Tensou Sentai Goseiger.\n\n&quot;Power Rangers Megaforce&quot; was trademarked by Saban Brands in 2011 during the run of Power Rangers Samurai. Casting sides released in April 2012 match with the blue and silver rangers of Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger. On 11th June 2012, it was revealed that the season will be based on Tensou Sentai Goseiger.[1] The official name was then revealed as &quot;Power Rangers Megaforce&quot;. The second season, titled Super Megaforce, will incorporate elements from Gokaiger.[2][3][4][5] That makes Megaforce the first hybrid adaptation since Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n\nOn June 17th, 2013 the official press release unveiled the plot of Power Rangers Super Megaforce:  &quot;The upcoming season of Power Rangers Super Megaforce focuses on the Rangers' mission to defeat a massive alien army Armada that was sent to conquer Earth. To face this threat, Gosei, a supernatural guardian who has protected Earth for centuries, gives the Rangers special morphers and keys, which allow them to morph into Super Megaforce Rangers. The Rangers also have an added special ability to morph into any team of Power Rangers from the past. These super-sized adventures can only mean one thing: the all-new Power Rangers Super Megaforce has arrived!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbea234679eccfaa6e7442a8b8c92519f88a87ff","amp;dn":"Power+Rangers+Megaforce+%28Legacy+Collection+and+Beyond%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbea234679eccfaa6e7442a8b8c92519f88a87ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,234,35,70,121,236,207,170,110,116,66,168,184,201,37,25,248,138,135,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
