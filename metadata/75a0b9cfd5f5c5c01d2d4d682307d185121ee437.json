In this course, author Joseph Lowery introduces each of the service's five products: App Engine, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and Cloud SQL. Learn the basics of hosting a mobile app with App Engine and see how to analyze massive datasets in seconds with BigQuery. Then explore the benefits of Cloud Storage, including unlimited file storage and fast data retrieval, and learn how to establish a cloud-based private network with Compute Engine. Finally, the course walks through setting up and managing a cloud-based relational database with Cloud SQL.\n\n\nTopics include:\n------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy Google Cloud Platform?\nDeploying an app with Google App Engine\nActivating and working with Google Cloud Storage\nLoading, querying, and exporting data with BigQuery\nWorking with Cloud Storage buckets\nManaging cloud-based private networks\nImporting and exporting data\nScheduling backups\nWorking with Google Datastore\n\n\n1.
