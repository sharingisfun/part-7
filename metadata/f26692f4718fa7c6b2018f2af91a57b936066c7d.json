The soundtrack was composed by Clint Mansell and performed by the Kronos Quartet.\nMansell's score was his follow-up to the score he composed for Aronofsky's first film, Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬, and has since become a cult hit. The music is notable for its use of sharp, often staccato 'un-vibrato-ed' string instruments to create a cold and discomforting sound from instruments frequently used for their warmth and softness (an effect pioneered in film soundtracks by Bernard Hermann). Reportedly Kronos Quartet asked for a very reasonable fee which, according to Aronofsky, suited him well; Aronofsky also stated that the music inspired him during the editing process.\n\n.: Cover :.\n\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1 - Summer Overture\n2 - Party\n3 - Coney Islend Dreaming\n4 - Party II\n5 - Chocolate Charms\n6 - Ghost Of Things To Come\n7 - Dreams\n8 - Tense\n9 - DR.
