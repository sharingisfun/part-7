It's even more of that &quot;Ah ha, so that' s how they do it,&quot; straight-to-the-point, skip-the-techno-jargon stuff people can really use today, and that made volume 1 the world's best-selling book on digital photography.\nThis book truly has a brilliant premise, and here's how Scott describes it: &quot;If you and I were out on a shoot and you asked me, 'Hey Scott, I want the light for this portrait to look really soft and flattering. How far back should I put this softbox?' I wouldn't give you a lecture about lighting ratios, or flash modifiers. In real life, I'd just turn to you and say, 'Move it in as close to your subject as you possibly can, without it actually showing up in the shot.' Well, that's what this book is all about: you and I out shooting where I answer questions, give you advice, and share the secrets I've learned, just like I would with a friend--without all the technical explanations and techie photo speak.&quot;\nEach page covers a single concept on how to make your photography better. Every time you turn the page, you'll learn another pro setting, tool, or trick to transform your work from snapshots into gallery prints. If you're tired of taking shots that look &quot;okay,&quot; and if you're tired of looking in photography magazines and thinking, &quot;Why don't my shots look like that?&quot; then this is the book for you.\nThis isn't a book of theory, full of confusing jargon and detailed concepts. This is a book on which button to push, which setting to use, and when to use it. With another 200 of the most closely guarded photographic &quot;tricks of the trade,&quot; this book gets you shooting dramatically better-looking, sharper, more colorful, more professional-looking photos every time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa34b7defde2bd989bca9100ab0756dac6f3cb56","amp;dn":"The+Digital+Photography+Book+-+Vol+4++Scott+Kelby+%28.PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa34b7defde2bd989bca9100ab0756dac6f3cb56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,52,183,222,253,226,189,152,155,202,145,0,171,7,86,218,198,243,203,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
