Why  the  endless marital  quarrels  over who  is\n      right?  Why  can we  see  hypocrisy  in  others but  not  in\n      ourselves? Are  we all  liars? Or do  we really  believe the\n      stories we tell?\n\n      Renowned  social  psychologists   Carol  Tavris  and  Elliot\n      Aronson take a  compelling look into how the  brain is wired\n      for  self-justification.  When  we make  mistakes,  we  must\n      calm  the cognitive  dissonance  that jars  our feelings  of\n      self-worth. And  so we  create fictions  that absolve  us of\n      responsibility,  restoring our  belief  that  we are  smart,\n      moral, and right -- a belief that often keeps us on a course\n      that is dumb, immoral, and wrong.\n\n      Backed  by  years  of  research  and  delivered  in  lively,\n      energetic prose, Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me) offers a\n      fascinating explanation  of self-deception -- how  it works,\n      the harm it can cause, and how we can overcome it.\n\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4454ef40b8ca97c3e35c1a9fce5fe825b391f68","amp;dn":"%28epub%29+Carol+Tavris%2C+Elliot+Aronson+-+Mistakes+Were+Made+But+Not","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4454ef40b8ca97c3e35c1a9fce5fe825b391f68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,69,78,244,11,140,169,124,62,53,193,169,252,229,254,130,91,57,31,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
