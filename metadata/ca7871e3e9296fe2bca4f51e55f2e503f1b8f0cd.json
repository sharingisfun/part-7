Sayers, in which he solves mysteriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½usually but not always murders. Wimsey is an archetype for the British gentleman detective.\n\nBorn in 1890 and aging in real time, Wimsey is described as having at best average height with straw-coloured hair, a beaked nose, and a vaguely foolish face. (Reputedly his looks were patterned after those of academic Roy Ridley). He also possesses considerable intelligence and athletic ability, evidenced by his playing cricket for Oxford University while earning a First and by creating a spectacularly successful publicity campaign for Whifflet cigarettes while working for Pym's Publicity, Ltd. and still, at 40, being able to turn three cartwheels in the office corridor, stopping just short of the boss's open office door (Murder Must Advertise). Wimsey sometimes affects a slightly silly behaviour, so that people underestimate him.\n\nAmong Lord Peter's hobbies, apart from criminology, is collecting incunabula (books printed in the 15th century). He is an expert on matters of food (especially wine) and male fashion, as well as on classical music. He is quite good at playing Bach's works for keyboard instruments on a piano he babies even more than his books, wines, and cars. One of Lord Peter's cars is a 12-cylinder (&quot;double-six&quot;) 1927 Daimler four-seater, which he calls &quot;Mrs. Merdle&quot; after a character in Little Dorrit (by Charles Dickens).\n\n\nIan Carmichael stars as Lord Peter Wimsey\n\nListed by broadcast year.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Peter_Wimsey#Novels&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Peter_Wimsey#Novels&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLord Peter Wimsey -
