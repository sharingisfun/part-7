Seeing as many of you are downloading it I figured I may as well make a proper description. \n\nThis torrent consists of some ~180 Pdf, including personal journals, articles and research papers from people like:\n\n-Maxwell\n-Edison\n-Tesla\n-Heaviside Oliver\n-Kennelly Arthur\n-Steinmetz\n-Eric Dollard\n-Alexander MacFarlane\n-Adolph-Guillemin\n-Krafft Carl\n-Thomas Valone \n-Faraday Michael\n-Wiliam Lyne\n-Le Bon Gustave\n-Albert Schwitzer \n-Rudolph Steiner\n-Sir William Crookes\n-Walter-Russell\n\nto name a few. \n\nThis torrent is a gold mine of knowledge, all the journals are scanned and exactly how they would be should you have the physical copy in your hands, minus the weight of course. This is probably the best thing an electrical engineer could ask for when beginning his or her career in the field. Read these books and you're effectively recreating the mentality that was, when electrical engineering was in its early days.\n\nHope you guys enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:010d49033fad831178387cc15dcc681ad1072acc","amp;dn":"Books+On+Electricity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"010d49033fad831178387cc15dcc681ad1072acc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,13,73,3,63,173,131,17,120,56,124,193,93,204,104,26,209,7,42,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
