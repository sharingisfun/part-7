Originally just a few hundred tents, it now has 24,000 homes with a busy shopping street (known locally as the Champs-Elysees), hospitals and schools, and like every other city on earth, Zaatari has births, deaths, marriages and everything in between. In this episode, Anita tackles the logistical feat of providing water in the middle of a desert, Javid meets some of the children recovering from injuries of war and Ben does the bakery night shift to find out how 90,000 loaves are baked every day to feed the camp. Anita and Javid are invited to a wedding and Ben finds out how war has affected education.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20 (~3204Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.46 VBR 48KHz (~126Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 59 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 2\r\nPart Size: 1.37 GB (average)\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d48fecaaf3abecaea16158315962ac009e481aa0","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Refugee+Camp+Our+Desert+Home+1of2+720p+HDTV+x264-MVG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d48fecaaf3abecaea16158315962ac009e481aa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,143,236,170,243,171,236,174,161,97,88,49,89,98,172,0,158,72,26,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
