Differing viewpoints sour the friendship between Ken and Lobang. Meanwhile, Ken's father has become partially paralyzed because of his stroke but is determined to make a recovery. After booking out, Aloysius seeks advice from his parents as he feels excluded from the group; his father (Chen Tianwen) tells him the best solution is not to do anything. Back at Tekong, Recruit IP Man learns about &quot;Real Bullet&quot; Zhen Zidan (Benjamin Mok), an &quot;Ah Beng&quot; who stole his girlfriend Mayoki (Sherraine Low). IP Man hits back by criticizing Mayoki for her inferior qualities. &quot;Real Bullet&quot; in turn uploads a video of him and Mayoki engaging in an initimate act. Crestfallen, IP Man seeks help from his bunk mates; Lobang plots a scheme to ambush &quot;Real Bullet&quot; and Mayoki at a car-park by throwing heaps of human excretion mixed with chilli and wasabi at them while they are in the car. However, a gang soon chases after them after &quot;Real Bullet&quot; calls for back-up, but at last the recruits manage to shake the gang off; they celebrate at a restaurant at White Sands later that evening. However, at the restaurant, they are ambushed by more gang members, who have managed to track them down. Ken runs back to save his mates, per the principle &quot;Leave no man behind&quot;, unlike Aloyisus, who is quick to flee. Because Ken saved his life, Lobang vows to stop smoking in return.\nAfter an investigation by the sergeants, Ken and the perpetrators of the earlier scheme carried out that day are punished. Ken's concerned parents speak to CPT Tham after learning of what had happened. His father has shown visible signs of improvement and is starting to be able to talk, thanks the OC for training Ken to become a &quot;real soldier&quot;, but is against him being punished for fighting. The OC agrees to make an exception and exclude Ken from punishment. Ken, though, after learning that the others still would be punished, is granted permission to continue his punishment. The next day, Lobang attempts to sabotage Aloysius for abandoning the team earlier on by throwing his magazine but after a comical turn of events, it is Lobang who loses his magazine. However, Aloysius quickly gives his magazine to Lobang during an equipment check and takes the blame. While searching for the missing magazine, the relationship between the two grow better.\nThe eccentric Lieutenant S.T. Choong (mrbrown) is chased by a large herd of wild boars halfway into an assessment for leadership potential; the soldiers are quick to come to his rescue. Following their passing out parade, the recruits reunite with their kins. Ken's father is present and comes to greet Ken; he is finally able to walk steadily without any aid. As the film ends, various recruits' postings are shown Ã¢â‚¬â€ only Lobang and Ken have made it to Officer Cadet School (OCS).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46478ab26f7fe66ba49870e41f09fb3706cecdf1","amp;dn":"Ah+Boys+To+Men+Part+2+%5BDVDRip%5D+%5BXviD%5D+%5BUNCOMPRESSED%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46478ab26f7fe66ba49870e41f09fb3706cecdf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,71,138,178,111,127,230,107,164,152,112,228,31,9,251,55,6,206,205,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
