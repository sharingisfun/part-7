Using period training manuals, after-action reports, countless interviews with Panzer veterans, and his own experiences as an armor commander in the modern German Army, Schneider describes World War II Panzer tactics, coupling his narrative with scores of illustrations that highlight armor concepts. Schneider covers the major types of small-unit operational art-offensive and defensive-and also discusses road marches, reconnaissance, command and control, working with other arms of service, life in a tank, armor training, gunnery, and the future of armor. The book provides useful insight into armor tactics for both the layman and the armor enthusiast.\n\nAmazon.com title link; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Panzer-Tactics-German-Small-Unit-Armor/dp/0811732444&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Panzer-Tactics-German-Small-Unit-Armor/dp/0811732444&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da75cdd62879b04d91f53e6d87c74e45290d44ce","amp;dn":"Panzer+Tactics%3A+German+Small-Unit+Armor+Tactics+in+World+War+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da75cdd62879b04d91f53e6d87c74e45290d44ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,117,205,214,40,121,176,77,145,245,62,109,135,199,78,69,41,13,68,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
