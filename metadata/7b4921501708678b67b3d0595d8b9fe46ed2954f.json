Initially covering the more serious aspects of the C64 platform,\nCU introduced games coverage after the first year, and this became the\npredominant feature for the rest of the magazine's run. CU quietly\ndropped it's C64 coverage to become CU Amiga in 1990 (the complete CU\nAmiga archive is also available as a separate download - please see\nRetroPDFs for more information).\n\nThese PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans available on\npublic Torrent trackers. They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and\ncopying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd\nlike to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most\nPDF readers, including the iPad. The OCR software has increased the file\nsize slightly, and some issues haven't OCR'd as well as others, due to the\nlayout and fonts used.\n\nMore OCR'd mags will be periodically available - please check\n(or just Google &quot;RetroPDFs&quot;) for more\ninformation.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors to RetroPDFs for their\ncontinued support.\n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine.
