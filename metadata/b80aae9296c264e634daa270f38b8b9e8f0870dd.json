There is a sublime quality within this album, a spiritual transcendence. In fact the name, &quot;Om&quot;, is the sacred syllable in Hindu religion, which symbolizes the infinite or the entire Universe.\n \nA Meditative voyage exploring the realms of not only the music at hand, but a personal odyssey where the musicians discover their full potential, and then go even further. It's all about how far they can go, what new realms could be explored musically by pushing themselves, and their instruments, to the final limit.\n\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\nOm\n\nRecorded in 1965, released in 1968\n\n\n\n  CD / 1998 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nOm (Part 1 &amp; 2)\n\n\nRecorded on October 1, 1965 at Camelot Sound Studios, Lynwood, Washington\t\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nJohn Coltrane - tenor and soprano saxophone\n\nPharoah Sanders - tenor saxophone\n\nDonald Rafael Garrett - double bass and clarinet\n\nJoe Brazil - flute\n\nMcCoy Tyner - piano\n\nJimmy Garrison - bass\n\nElvin Jones - drums\n\n\nJohn Coltrane\nOm\nRecorded in 1965, released in 1968","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b80aae9296c264e634daa270f38b8b9e8f0870dd","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+OM+1965+%2F+1968","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b80aae9296c264e634daa270f38b8b9e8f0870dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,10,174,146,150,194,100,230,52,218,162,112,243,139,139,158,143,8,112,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
