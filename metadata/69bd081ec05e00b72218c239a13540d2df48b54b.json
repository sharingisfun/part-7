Medicine has come a long way since then. So why do organizations and corporations cling to management techniques that are just as obsolete as the bleed-and-leech model? In a global workplace that is more diverse and filled with entirely new challenges, now is the time for organizations to evolve to a more effective style of leadership and project management.\n\nA roadmap for leading projects and groups, Moving from Project Management to Project Leadership: A Practical Guide to Leading Groups covers the theory, strategy, and tactics that create high-performing teams and organizations. The first half of the book delineates the theories and practical knowledge required to be an extraordinarily effective leader. It defines what it is, exactly, that you need to do to be the best leader you can be. The second half of the book provides the tools and processes required to put that knowledge into place.\n\nThe author explores the theory that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all about the communication. By paying close attention to organizational clarity and the way messages are transmitted within your organization, you will find new ways of empowering people while increasing efficiency ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ something the old management style can rarely boast. If project leadership is the main thesis of this book, the power of effective top-down communication is the tune youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be humming after putting this book down.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 298 pages\n    * Publisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (April 29, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1439826676\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1439826676","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69bd081ec05e00b72218c239a13540d2df48b54b","amp;dn":"Moving+from+Project+Management+to+Project+Leadership%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69bd081ec05e00b72218c239a13540d2df48b54b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,189,8,30,192,94,0,183,34,24,194,57,161,53,64,210,223,72,181,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
