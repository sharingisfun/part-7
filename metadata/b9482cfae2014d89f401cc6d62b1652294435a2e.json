Background mathematics and specific engineering \ntechniques are kept to a minimum so that only a basic knowledge of high-school \nmathematics is needed to understand the material covered. The authors begin \nwith many practical applications in coding, including the repetition code, \nthe Hamming code and the Huffman code. They then explain the corresponding \ninformation theory, from entropy and mutual information to channel capacity \nand the information transmission theorem. Finally, they provide insights into \nthe connections between coding theory and other fields. Many worked examples \nare given throughout the book, using practical applications to illustrate \ntheoretical definitions. Exercises are also included, enabling readers to \ndouble-check what they have learned and gain glimpses into more advanced \ntopics, making this perfect for anyone who needs a quick introduction to the \nsubject.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9482cfae2014d89f401cc6d62b1652294435a2e","amp;dn":"Cambridge+University+Press+A+Students+Guide+To+Coding+And+Inform","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9482cfae2014d89f401cc6d62b1652294435a2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,72,44,250,226,1,77,137,244,1,204,109,98,177,101,34,148,67,90,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
