The old paradigm that concentrates wealth, founded on the greed of the few, is causing economic and ecological collapse. The resulting crisis has become the catalyst for a profound awakening:  millions of people are deciding that enough is enough Ã¢â‚¬â€œ  the time has come to create a new world, a world that works for all life.\n\nThe film connects the dots in this era of rapidly evolving social change, featuring captivating insider scenes from the Egyptian Revolution, the Indignado uprising in Spain,  Occupy Wall Street in New York, Indigenous activists at the Alberta Tar Sands, the climate justice movement, and beyond. Woven throughout the action oriented backbone of the film is a deep exploration of public love, and compelling stories of an emerging new paradigm.  It features some of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key visionaries on alternative systems of economics, sustainability, and empathy, including Naomi Klein, Bill McKibben, Jeremy Rifkin, bell hooks and Charles Eisenstein.\n\nOccupy Love is  a moving, transformative, heartfelt film, featuring RipperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature stunning visuals and rich soundscapes.  A  powerful cinematic experience that will leave audiences inspired.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d032149233b8ac446fa1c7a32bc3f1389e43a2e","amp;dn":"Occupy+Love+-+Revolution+Of+The+Heart+-+By+Velcrow+Ripper+%28Full+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d032149233b8ac446fa1c7a32bc3f1389e43a2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,3,33,73,35,59,138,196,70,250,28,122,50,188,63,19,137,228,58,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
