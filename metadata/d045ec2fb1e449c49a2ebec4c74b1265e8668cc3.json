When he retires to his compartment, he is killed by a bomb. While the others are questioned at the next stop, Frankfurt, they learn that the dead man was actually one of the doctor's bodyguards. Bernhardt had been posing as another passenger, and Lucienne is his secretary.\n\nBernhardt's enemies are not foiled for long. He is kidnapped from the busy train station in broad daylight after he greets Walther, an old, trusted friend. The U.S. Army quickly institutes a search of the city, but when Lucienne begs her fellow travelers to help look for Bernhardt (as they know what he looks like), they at first all decline. One by one, however, they change their minds.\n\nLucienne suggests they go see Walther, unaware that he has betrayed Bernhardt in return for his missing wife's location. When they get there, they discover only Walther's body. He hanged himself after the kidnappers revealed his wife has been dead all along.\n\nThe group then splits up to cover the city, with Lindley accompanying Lucienne to various illegal nightclubs. At the last one, Lindley notices a woman smoking an unusually long cigarette, just like the ones Bernhardt likes. He picks up a discarded butt and shows Lucienne that it has a &quot;B&quot; monogram on it. When the woman turns out to be an entertainer, pretending to know the answers of questions posed by the customers, Lindley asks her where Bernhardt is. Her clown assistant impedes Lindley, allowing her to get away. When Lindley and Lucienne question Sergeant Barnes, the American soldier who was sitting with the woman beforehand, he reluctantly agrees to lead them to where she lives.\n\nIt is a trap, however. When they get to an abandoned brewery, Barnes turns out to be working with the kidnappers. Now all three are prisoners. Fortunately, an undercover agent had knocked out the clown and taken his place, accompanying the others to the hideout. He is shot when the real clown shows up, but manages to get back to the nightclub and inform the authorities where Bernhardt is being held. American soldiers break in just as Bernhardt and Lucienne are about to be shot, and free the three unharmed. Kessler, the ringleader, is killed by Perrot, who turns out to be Bernhardt's would-be assassin.\n\nThe passengers reboard the train. Perrot suggests that each of them take a turn guarding Bernhardt in his compartment, with him going first. Afterward, Lindley pieces together various lies Perrot had told and recalls that he knew that the bomb was made from a grenade, but the others dismiss his suspicions. Luckily, he sees Perrot strangling Bernhardt in the reflection from a passing train and saves the doctor's life. Perrot is shot dead as he tries to flee.\n\nCRITICAL RESPONSE:-\nThe staff at Variety magazine gave the film a positive review, and wrote, &quot;Most striking feature of this production is its extraordinary background of war-ravaged Germany. With a documentary eye, this film etches a powerfully grim picture of life amidst the shambles. It makes awesome and exciting cinema...Ryan establishes himself as a first-rate actor in this film, demonstrating conclusively that his brilliant performance in Crossfire was no one-shot affair.&quot; Variety, however, did criticize the screenplay for &quot;its failure to break away from the formula of anti-Nazi films.&quot;\n\nThe New York Times had a similar response, stating the film's photography of the post-war landscape creates a &quot;realistic, awesome and impressive vista.&quot; After luke-warm praise for the film's plot, the reviewer continues, &quot;...it is the panoramic and close views of life amid the 'new architecture' of Frankfort and Berlin Ã¢â‚¬â€ 'early Twentieth Century modern warfare' architecture Ã¢â‚¬â€ which gives the adventure the authentic impact of a documentary.&quot;\n\nThe scenes of the interior of the RTO (Rail Transportation Office) Army Duty Train to Berlin in this film look essentially the same as the train looked in the mid-1970s, which reinforces the evaluation of the New York Times review that Berlin Express had &quot;the authentic impact of a documentary.&quot;\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 932 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 87 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d045ec2fb1e449c49a2ebec4c74b1265e8668cc3","amp;dn":"Berlin+Express+%281948%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Merle+Oberon%2C+Robert+Ryan+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d045ec2fb1e449c49a2ebec4c74b1265e8668cc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,69,236,47,177,228,73,196,154,46,190,196,199,75,18,101,232,102,140,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
