Quality of life has improved dramatically in the last few decades alone, and the future is bright. But students must not forget that God provided humans with minds and resources to bring about these advances.\n A biblical perspective of healing and the use of medicine provides the best foundation for treating diseases and injury. In Exploring the World of Medicine, author John Hudson Tiner reveals the spectacular discoveries that started with men and women who used their abilities to better mankind and give glory to God.\n The fascinating history of medicine comes alive in this book, providing students with a healthy dose of facts, mini-biographies, and vintage illustrations. Includes chapter tests and index.\n\nAbout the author:\n John Hudson Tiner received five National Science Foundation teaching fellowships during his 12 years of teaching science and mathematics. He is a graduate of chemistry at the College of the Holy Cross (Massachusetts), graduate of astronomy at Sam Houston State University (Texas), and a graduate of mathematics at Duke University (NC). He also worked as a mathematician and cartographer for the Defense Mapping Agency, Aerospace Center (St. Louis).\n Today, Tiner is a full-time writer. His popular non-fiction books tell their stories through the lives of people who left the world in a better condition than they found it. He says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“After the research is finished, a wonderful moment occurs when the story takes over and the characters come alive. No longer am I a writer, but a time traveler who stands unobserved in the shadows and reports the events as they occur.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n He has received numerous honors for his writing, including the Missouri Writer's Guild award for best juvenile book for Exploring the World of Chemistry, which was also published by Master Books.  He and his wife, Jeanene, live in Missouri.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:174d4497898143794ea7ce3407ede87ed0832e4c","amp;dn":"Exploring+The+History+Of+Medicine+-+John+Hudson+Tiner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"174d4497898143794ea7ce3407ede87ed0832e4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,77,68,151,137,129,67,121,78,167,206,52,7,237,232,126,208,131,46,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
