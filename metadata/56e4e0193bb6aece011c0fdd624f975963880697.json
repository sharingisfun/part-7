It was released with 1962Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1966 (&quot;The Red Album&quot;), in 1973. 1967Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1970 made number 1 on the American Billboard chart and number 2 on the British Album Chart. This album was re-released in September 1993 on compact disc, charting at number 4 in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe album was compiled by Beatles manager Allen Klein. Songs performed by the Beatles as solo artists were also considered for inclusion, but like the cover songs on 1962Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1966, limited space resulted in this idea having to be abandoned. \n\nAs with 1962Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1966, this compilation was produced by Apple/EMI at least partially in response to a bootleg collection titled Alpha Omega, which had been sold on television the previous year. Print advertising for the two records made a point of declaring them &quot;the only authorized collection of the Beatles.&quot;\n\nFor the group's 1963 debut LP Please Please Me, photographer Angus McBean took the distinctive colour photograph of the group looking down over the stairwell inside EMI House (EMI's London headquarters in Manchester Square, now demolished).\n\nIn 1969, The Beatles asked McBean to recreate this shot. Although a photograph from the 1969 photo shoot was originally intended for the then-planned Get Back album, it was not used when that project saw eventual release in 1970 as Let It Be. Instead, another photograph from the 1969 shoot, along with an unused photograph from the 1963 photo shoot, was used for both this LP and 1962Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1966.\n\nThe inner gatefold photo for both LPs is from the &quot;Mad Day Out&quot; photo session in London on Sunday 28 July 1968.\n\nThe album cover was designed by Tom Wilkes.\n\n2010 Remaster - Track Listing [320k MP3]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967%E2%80%931970#Track_listing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967%E2%80%931970#Track_listing&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56e4e0193bb6aece011c0fdd624f975963880697","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+1967-1970+%5B320k+MP3%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56e4e0193bb6aece011c0fdd624f975963880697","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,228,224,25,59,182,174,206,1,28,15,221,98,79,151,89,99,136,6,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
