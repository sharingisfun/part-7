It explains methods to help distinguish between ideas that are considered valid science, and ideas that can be considered pseudoscience. Sagan states that when new ideas are offered for consideration, they should be tested by means of skeptical thinking, and should stand up to rigorous questioning.\n\n-English language\n-Max quality VBR MP3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33b0e2c644668d672555052373e17042aa92690b","amp;dn":"Carl+Sagan+-+The+Demon+Haunted+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33b0e2c644668d672555052373e17042aa92690b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,176,226,198,68,102,141,103,37,85,5,35,115,225,112,66,170,146,105,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
