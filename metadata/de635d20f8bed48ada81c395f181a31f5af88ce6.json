Based on nine years of research, buttressed by rigorous analysis and infused with engaging stories, Collins and his colleague, Morten Hansen, enumerate the principles for building a truly great enterprise in unpredictable, tumultuous, and fast-moving times.\n\nThe new study\nGreat by Choice distinguishes itself from CollinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prior work by its focus not just on performance, but also on the type of unstable environments faced by leaders today.\n\nWith a team of more than twenty researchers, Collins and Hansen studied companies that rose to greatnessÃ¢â‚¬â€beating their industry indexes by a minimum of ten times over fifteen yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€in environments characterized by big forces and rapid shifts that leaders could not predict or control. The research team then contrasted these Ã¢â‚¬Å“10X companiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to achieve greatness in similarly extreme environments.\n\nThe new findings\nThe study results were full of provocative surprises. Such as:\n\n    The best leaders were not more risk taking, more visionary, and more creative than the comparisons; they were more disciplined, more empirical, and more paranoid.\n    Innovation by itself turns out not to be the trump card in a chaotic and uncertain world; more important is the ability to scale innovation, to blend creativity with discipline.\n    Following the belief that leading in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“fast worldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ always requires Ã¢â‚¬Å“fast decisionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“fast actionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a good way to get killed.\n    The great companies changed less in reaction to a radically changing world than the comparison companies.\n\nThe authors challenge conventional wisdom with thought-provoking, sticky, and supremely practical concepts. They include: 10Xers; the 20 Mile March; Fire Bullets, Then Cannonballs; Leading above the Death Line; Zoom Out, Then Zoom In; and the SMaC Recipe.\n\nFinally, in the last chapter, Collins and Hansen present their most provocative and original analysis: defining, quantifying, and studying the role of luck. The great companies and the leaders who built them were not luckier than the comparisons, but they did get a higher Return on Luck.\n\nThis book is classic Collins: contrarian, data-driven, and uplifting. He and Hansen show convincingly that, even in a chaotic and uncertain world, greatness happens by choice, not chance.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de635d20f8bed48ada81c395f181a31f5af88ce6","amp;dn":"Great+by+Choice+Uncertainty+Chaos+and+Luck+Why+Some+Thrive+Despi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de635d20f8bed48ada81c395f181a31f5af88ce6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,99,93,32,248,190,212,138,218,129,195,149,241,129,163,31,90,248,140,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
