Nearing the end of 2006, the\nChicago foursome which formed in the very beginning of 2005 and\nreleased their debut album, So Sudden, in October of the same year\nwas on the verge of bidding each other and their band adieu. They had\njust released their sophomore effort, Like Vines (which has sold over\n60,000 copies to date), through Pete Wentz\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Decaydance imprint\non label Fueled By Ramen, but thankfully had embarked on a sold-out headlining tour which came to its pinnacle during a packed show at\nPhiladelphia\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Theater of the Living Arts. Suddenly the band realized\nthat people cared, and then, even more importantly, that they did too.\nOnce we did the headlining tour, we realized there were all these people\ncoming to see us and saying how much they genuinely appreciate the music, says vocalist/pianist Greta Salpeter. We realized that we were part of something greater than all these little problems we had.\nGoodbye Blues was actualized over the course of two months in Kevin\nAugunas (Cold War Kids) North Hollywood studio, beginning in September of\n2007. The album bridges an expanse between invitingly catchy pop buoyancy\nand a certain emotional and intellectual depth The Hush Sound has never\nfully explored before. Standout tracks like Medicine Man , Honey and\nHurricane reveal not only the group s new sense of maturity, but their\nburgeoning skill for sculpting emotive, relatable songs that exist not just\nas moments of music but as, what Greta sees as little pieces of art.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:566f6cfc302f33f39b4ece9b09022198bb5d14bd","amp;dn":"The+Hush+Sound+-+Goodbye+Blues+%282008%2C+MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"566f6cfc302f33f39b4ece9b09022198bb5d14bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,111,108,252,48,47,51,243,155,78,206,155,9,2,33,152,187,93,20,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
