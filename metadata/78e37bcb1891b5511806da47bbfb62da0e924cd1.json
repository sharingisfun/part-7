Roberts formed the band that was eventually known as William in 1993. The band's name was changed to Northstar in 1996. Although the band gained some notice in independent rock circles, they could not break through to a national audience, and broke up in 1999 after failing to release an album.[1] Roberts' bandmate George Donoso went on to significant success in indie rock circles with The Dears, but Roberts struggled for several years afterward.\n\nAfter disbanding Northstar in 1999, Roberts promptly recorded the full-length and now very collectable independent debut Brother Down at home. In 2001, Roberts recorded and released a six-song EP[clarification needed], The Inhuman Condition, independently. The EP sold slowly at first, but following a re-release of the EP in the summer of 2002 on MapleMusic Recordings, his first single &quot;Brother Down&quot; became one of the biggest Canadian hits of the year, and the second single, &quot;Don't Walk Away Eileen&quot;, followed suit in the fall.\n\nRoberts then signed to Universal Music and released his full-length major label debut, We Were Born in a Flame, in June 2003. That album's singles, &quot;Where Have All the Good People Gone?&quot; and &quot;Hard Road&quot;, received a large amount of success, though mainly just in Canada.\n\nThe band's second album, Chemical City, was released in Canada in April 2006. In Canada, the first single was &quot;The Gate&quot;, which quickly shot to number one on Canadian rock radio. The second single in Canada was &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot;. &quot;With a Bullet&quot;, the third song used to promote the album on Canadian radio, received little attention and no video was made for it.\n\nRoberts' most recent album, Love at the End of the World, was released in May 2008. It debuted at the number one position on the Canadian album chart,[2] a first for Roberts. The lead single, &quot;Them Kids&quot;, debuted on iTunes on March 4, 2008.\n\nSam Roberts is trilingual, speaking English, French, and Spanish. He married his high school sweetheart Jen in 2004, and they have two daughters.[3]\n\nSam Roberts and his bandmates will release their fourth studio album, &quot;Collider&quot;, May 10, 2011.[4] It will be the first album under the moniker &quot;Sam Roberts Band&quot; instead of &quot;Sam Roberts&quot;.[5] The first single, &quot;I Feel You&quot; was officially released to Canadian radio on February 28th, with an iTunes Canada release of March 8th.\n\n\n\n\n\nCollider 2011\n\n\nCollider is the forthcoming fourth studio album from Canadian rock musician Sam Roberts. It will be released on May 10, 2011.[1] It is the first album to be released under the moniker &quot;Sam Roberts Band&quot; instead of &quot;Sam Roberts&quot;. Collider features several guest musicians, including Elizabeth Powell (of fellow Montreal band Land Of Talk) on &quot;Longitude&quot;, percussionist Ben Massarella (of Califone), and woodwind player Stuart D. Bogie (of Antibalas).[2]\n\nThe first Canadian single, &quot;I Feel You&quot;, was released to Canadian radio on February 28, 2011, and made commercially available via iTunes Canada on March 8, 2011.[2] An edited version of the song was made available for free online listening.[3]\n\nThe first American single, &quot;The Last Crusade&quot;,[4] was made available for listening online on March 21, 2011\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Last Crusade&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Without A Map&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Let It In&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Graveyard Shift&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;No Arrows&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Longitude&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Streets Of Heaven (Promises, Promises)&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Sang Froid&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Twist The Knife&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;I Feel You&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;The Band Vs.
