At the center are Barb and Lily, two women at opposite ends of the beauty spectrum, but with the same problem: each fears she will never find a love that can overcome her looks. Barb, a stunningly beautiful costume designer, makes herself ugly in hopes of finding true love. Meanwhile, her friend Lily, a brilliantly talented but plain-looking musician, goes to fantastic lengths to attract the man who has rejected herÃ¢â‚¬â€with results that are as touching as they are transformative.\n\nTo complicate matters, Barb and Lily discover that they may have a murderer in their midst, that BarbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s calm disposition is more dangerously provocative than her beauty ever was, and that Lily's musical talents are more powerful than anyone could have imagined. Part literary whodunit, part surrealist farce, The Unfortunate Importance of Beauty serves as a smart, modern-day fairy tale. With biting wit and offbeat charm, Amanda Filipacchi illuminates the labyrinthine relationship between beauty, desire, and identity, asking at every turn: what does it truly mean to allow oneself to be seen?\n\nReview\n\n&quot;Filipacchi's fourth novel blithely upends the social constructs of beauty, desire, and art in her signature brisk, darkly comic style... with sharp surreal turns and layers of subversive meaning... While looks can kill, they're no match for Filipacchi's rapier wit.&quot; --Publishers Weekly\n\n&quot;Amanda Filipacchi's untamed imagination makes the world a little more fun to live in.
