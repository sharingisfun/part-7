For hundreds of years the demons have terrorized the night, slowly culling the human herd that shelters behind magical wardsÃ¢â‚¬â€symbols of power whose origins are lost in myth and whose protection is terrifyingly fragile. It was not always this way. Once, men and women battled the corelings on equal terms, but those days are gone. Night by night the demons grow stronger, while human numbers dwindle under their relentless assault. Now, with hope for the future fading, three young survivors of vicious demon attacks will dare the impossible, stepping beyond the crumbling safety of the wards to risk everything in a desperate quest to regain the secrets of the past. Together, they will stand against the night.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe Desert Spear:\n\n\n       The sun is setting on humanity. The night now belongs to voracious demons that prey upon a dwindling population forced to cower behind half-forgotten symbols of power. Legends tell of a Deliverer: a general who once bound all mankind into a single force that defeated the demons. But is the return of the Deliverer just another myth? Perhaps not. Out of the desert rides Ahmann Jardir, who has forged the desert tribes into a demon-killing army. He has proclaimed himself SharÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Dama Ka, the Deliverer, and he carries ancient weaponsÃ¢â‚¬â€a spear and a crownÃ¢â‚¬â€that give credence to his claim. But the Northerners claim their own Deliverer: the Warded Man, a dark, forbidding figure. Once, the SharÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Dama Ka and the Warded Man were friends. Now they are fierce adversaries. Yet as old allegiances are tested and fresh alliances forged, all are unaware of the appearance of a new breed of demon, more intelligentÃ¢â‚¬â€and deadlyÃ¢â‚¬â€than any that have come before.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe Daylight War:\n\n\n       On the night of the new moon, the demons rise in force, seeking the deaths of two men, both of whom have the potential to become the fabled Deliverer, the man prophesied to reunite the scattered remnants of humanity in a final push to destroy the demon corelings once and for all.\n \nArlen Bales was once an ordinary man, but now he has become something moreÃ¢â‚¬â€the Warded Man, tattooed with eldritch wards so powerful they make him a match for any demon. Arlen denies he is the Deliverer at every turn, but the more he tries to be one with the common folk, the more fervently they believe. Many would follow him, but ArlenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s path threatens to lead to a dark place he alone can travel to, and from which there may be no returning.\n \nThe only one with hope of keeping Arlen in the world of men, or joining him in his descent into the world of demons, is Renna Tanner, a fierce young woman in danger of losing herself to the power of demon magic.\n \nAhmann Jardir has forged the warlike desert tribes of Krasia into a demon-killing army and proclaimed himself SharÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Dama Ka, the Deliverer. He carries ancient weaponsÃ¢â‚¬â€a spear and a crownÃ¢â‚¬â€that give credence to his claim, and already vast swaths of the green lands bow to his control.\n \nBut Jardir did not come to power on his own. His rise was engineered by his First Wife, Inevera, a cunning and powerful priestess whose formidable demon bone magic gives her the ability to glimpse the future. IneveraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s motives and past are shrouded in mystery, and even Jardir does not entirely trust her.\n \nOnce Arlen and Jardir were as close as brothers. Now they are the bitterest of rivals. As humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enemies rise, the only two men capable of defeating them are divided against each other by the most deadly demons of allÃ¢â‚¬â€those lurking in the human heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK #3 IS NOT Graphic Audio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a56068302d2839b6f635741cafc00adfe2dadc5a","amp;dn":"The+Demon+Cycle+Books+1%2C+2+%26amp%3B+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a56068302d2839b6f635741cafc00adfe2dadc5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,96,104,48,45,40,57,182,246,53,116,28,175,192,10,223,226,218,220,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
