And yet we rarely ask ourselves how we got there or what our jobs mean to us. \n\nThe Pleasures and Sorrows of Work is an exploration of the joys and perils of the modern workplace, beautifully exploring what other people wake up to do each dayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and nightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to make our frenzied world function.
