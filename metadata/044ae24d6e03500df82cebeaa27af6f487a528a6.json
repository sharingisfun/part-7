This witty, frank, and refreshingly orthodox book draws from the beautiful truths of Catholic teaching to show people of all faiths about rich and satisfying sexuality. Hailed by Christians across the spectrum from Christopher West and Janet E. Smith to John L. Allen, Jr., Holy Sex! includes dozens of questionnaires, quizzes, and valuable lessons from real-life stories.\n\n\n---AN INTRODUCTION TO HOLY SEX---\n\nYou are about to discover ChristianityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best kept secret: the mystical power of sexual love and the surprising, practical insights this tradition reveals to enable you and your beloved to Ã¢â‚¬Å“rise in ecstasy toward the Divine.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½*\n\nIn Holy Sex! you will discover what it takes to celebrate a toe-curling, eye-popping, mind-blowing, deeply spiritual, and profoundly sacramental sexuality Ã¢â‚¬â€ a sexual relationship that is both fully sensual and fully equipped to move beyond sensuality so that it can become an authentically transformative, spiritual encounter. Heaven will be wedded to earth as you and your spouse walk the path toward becoming Infallible Lovers, the kind of lovers who can infuse their marital lives with a passion that reaches biblical proportions. Literally.\n\nIf these sound like big promises, they are meant to be. By the end of this book, you and your beloved will know how to create a passion that will make the angels smile and the neighbors sick with jealousy.\n\n\n---SURPRISING INSIGHTS FROM TRADITION---\n\nMost people believe the lie that Christians, and Catholic Christians in particular, have a dim, ignorant, and pleasure-killing view of sex. Nothing could be further from the truth. Not only can faithful Christian couples experience a sexual life that could make even the most jaded pagan jealous. Even more remarkably, Christian lovers are virtually commanded by God and their faith to do so. If this comes as a surprise to you, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not alone. Most couples have bought into the lies that keep them from their passionate inheritance. Most people think that only secular sexperts or ancient, moldering pagan mystics have anything to teach the world about sex. Most people have never encountered the truth, the beauty, the goodness, and the vitality that is the mystical Christian spirituality of sex or the practical wisdom it imparts to those couples willing to seek it. Now you can know the truth, and the truth will set your love free.\n\n\n---WHATÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S IN THIS BOOK?---\n\nPart One of Holy Sex! blows apart the lies youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been told about Christianity and sex and introduces you to the freeing truths of Infallible Loving. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll come to view sex as a microcosm of your entire relationship. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover what it takes to experience the kind of passion that challenges you and your mate to become better lovers and better people.\n\nPart Two gives you the tools to tap into the Five Powers of Holy Sex. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover how to expand your capacity to celebrate the sacred, redemptive, heavenly, uniting, and creative nature of sacred loving. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn to experience sex as a transformative encounter with incarnational love that unites God himself with you and your beloved.\n\nPart Three gives you everything you need to apply the principles of Holy Sex! to your marriage. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll encounter many tips and techniques you and your spouse can use to become Infallible Lovers, capable of creating an authentic sexual relationship rooted in deep intimacy, soulful sensuality, and a vision that propels you toward perfection in love.\n\nFinally, Part Four offers the practical guidance you need to overcome common sexual problems and obstacles that threaten your ability to experience everything your marriage was meant to be.\n\n\n\nRelated torrents:\n\n--Parenting With Grace: The Catholic Parents' Guide to Raising \n  Almost Perfect Kids (ebook)\n  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10638689&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10638689&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--Pope John Paul II - Theology of the Body in Simple Language (ebook)\n  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11977647&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11977647&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--Christopher West - Introduction to the Theology of the Body (audio)\n  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10951210&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10951210&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--Christopher West - Marriage and the Eucharist (audio)\n  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10739481&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10739481&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--Christopher West - Sexual Freedom (audio)\n  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10177794&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10177794&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--Dr. Scott Hahn - Marriage and Family: Love Unveiled (audio)\n  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10192707&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10192707&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--Johnnette Benkovic - For Love and Marriage (audio)\n  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11850215&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11850215&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--Jason &amp; Crystalina Evert - Love or Lust?
