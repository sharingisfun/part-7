Here Come The Warm Jets (2004 Digital Remaster)\n\n\nCD&gt;EAC&gt;WAV&gt;Trader's Little Helper&gt;FLAC (Level 8)\n\n\nIn 1973, fed up with Bryan Ferry's domineering in Roxy Music, Eno leapt into a solo career that would find him championing the &quot;art&quot; in &quot;artifice.&quot; This record is a who's who of the then-burgeoning English art-rock scene, featuring Robert Wyatt, Robert Fripp, and every member of Roxy Music except its leader (thus answering the musical question, &quot;What if Eno had helmed the third Roxy record instead of Ferry?&quot;). Warm Jets sports a lightheartedness that was a refreshing antidote to the pomposity of Yes and ELP on the dark side of art-rock's spectrum, with nonsensical, sound-based couplets such as &quot;Oh headless chicken / How can those teeth stand so much kicking?&quot; This debut is a milestone not just for Eno, but for all rocking music. Listen to Fripp's furious guitars on &quot;Baby's On Fire&quot; and &quot;Blank Frank.&quot; It's incredible, Velvet Underground-inspired rock in a scene that had forgotten what rocking meant. --Gene Booth\n\n\nLimited Edition Japanese &quot;Mini Vinyl&quot; CD, faithfully reproduced using original LP artwork including the inner sleeve.
