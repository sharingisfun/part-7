ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deafening, relentlessly juvenile, and hopelessly dudebro, but to its credit, it never pretends to be anything other than a teen-angst talisman meant to invoke the wrath of parents. Opener &quot;Middle Fingers Up,&quot; which unveils (with no attempts at subtlety) the band's mission statement through the suburban street poetry of frontman Chris &quot;Fronz&quot; Fronzak (&quot;Alright motherfu#ker listen up/This is for the fu#king homies steady givin no fu#ks&quot;), starts things off on an upbeat (so to speak) note, laying down a sinewy, laser-guided missile of a guitar line over a ferocious, breakdown-laden backbeat that manages to land multiple haymakers, adding an extra dimension of nihilism to each carefully placed &quot;fu#k&quot; not given. Elsewhere, the jarring title cut stammers about like a boozy, beer-goggled party goer trying to cross the living room without taking down a window treatment, and the thrashy &quot;Break S**t,&quot; which implores its listeners to &quot;Break every fu#king thing you see at this show&quot; and &quot;Punch a fu#king bully in the goddamned face,&quot; is a lot more fun the previous sentence would suggest, but there's not much here to recommend for anyone who isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t already on board the Attila pleasure barge. About that Life is what it is: the audio equivalent of being trapped inside a Warped Tour Porta Potty as a mob of fevered twentysomethings roll it down a hill.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/o22D5KP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/o22D5KP.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1b537127d5cae2cff8295caa68e9b6d1b0b6ca8","amp;dn":"Attila+-+About+That+Life+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1b537127d5cae2cff8295caa68e9b6d1b0b6ca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,181,55,18,125,92,174,44,255,130,149,202,166,142,155,109,27,11,108,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
