It was released on January 30, 2009 by Nuclear Blast. The album was initially recorded under the working title Deathglam.

Deathstars have now also put the song &quot;Night Electric Night&quot; on their Myspace page.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Recording\n    2 Album title\n    3 Track listing\n    4 Personnel\n    \nRecording\n\nThe album was recorded mostly in a studio in Sweden; however, the album was also recorded in part in New York City. The band completed recording the album at New York in December 2008.\nAlbum title\n\nProduction of the third album by Deathstars was revealed in an interview with the band conducted by Anthony Morgan of Lucem Fero in early 2008, where it was referred to by its working title, Deathglam. Vocalist Whiplasher Bernadotte expanded on the title, saying, &quot;. . . it'll just continue with the deathglam that we play. In terms of this new album's style, I think it's more Deathstars than ever . . .&quot;\n\nRecently, the band has announced on their official website that the record has been re-dubbed Night Electric Night. Whiplasher Bernadotte has stated that this is because calling the album Deathglam would be too &quot;obvious&quot;.\nTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Chertograd&quot;   \t4:45\n2. \t&quot;Night Electric Night&quot;   \t4:04\n3. \t&quot;Death Dies Hard&quot;   \t3:21\n4. \t&quot;Mark of the Gun&quot;   \t4:02\n5. \t&quot;Via the End&quot;   \t4:07\n6. \t&quot;Blood Stains Blondes&quot;   \t3:15\n7. \t&quot;Babylon&quot;   \t4:18\n8. \t&quot;The Fuel Ignites&quot;   \t4:00\n9. \t&quot;Arclight&quot;   \t4:35\n10. \t&quot;Venus in Arms&quot;   \t4:02\n11. \t&quot;Opium&quot;   \t3:43\nGold Edition bonus tracks \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n12. \t&quot;Night Electric Night&quot; (The Night Ignites Remix) \t3:04\n13. \t&quot;Via the End&quot; (Piano Version) \t3:27\n14. \t&quot;Night Electric Night&quot; (feat.
