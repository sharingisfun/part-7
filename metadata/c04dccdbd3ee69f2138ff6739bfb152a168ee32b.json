The Sherbs and Highway) was one of the most prominent and successful Australian rock bands of the 1970s. Their biggest singles were &quot;Summer Love&quot; (1975) and &quot;Howzat&quot; (1976), both reaching number one in Australia. &quot;Howzat&quot; was also a top 5 hit in the UK. Though the band's success in the U.S. was more limited, &quot;Howzat&quot; was a #61 hit in America, and under the name The Sherbs they also hit #61 in 1981 with the single &quot;I Have The Skill&quot;. Throughout the 1970s, the group was managed by Roger Davies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c04dccdbd3ee69f2138ff6739bfb152a168ee32b","amp;dn":"Sherbet+-+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c04dccdbd3ee69f2138ff6739bfb152a168ee32b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,77,204,219,211,238,105,242,19,143,246,115,155,251,21,42,22,142,227,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
