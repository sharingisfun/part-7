In his cases, Frost is assisted by a variety of different detective sergeants, with each bringing a different slant to the particular case. Comic relief is provided by Frost's interactions with the bureaucratically-minded Superintendent Norman Mullett, played by Bruce Alexander.\n\nThe series is set in the fictional South-Midlands town of Denton, and is marked by a gritty tone. It is believed that Denton is in Oxfordshire, with many references to Reading, Oxford, and in particular, Swindon, especially in the earlier episodes, as the M4 and A417 are often seen, and the map of Swindon was seen in the control room, although a map of Reading was used occasionally. The programme is produced by ITV in Leeds, and most of the outdoor locations are shot in West Yorkshire. Several scenes are filmed in and around the city and district of Wakefield and neighbouring small towns of Pontefract and Castleford, West Yorkshire.[3] The role of Frost was notable in changing the public perception of David Jason from a predominantly comic actor to a dramatic actor.\n\nSeason 15\n\nS15, Ep1 - Apr. 4, 2010 - If Dogs Run Free: Part 1\nSmall time hood Gerry Berland, who sponsors illegal dogfighting, tries to intimidate RSPCA officer who witnessed a murder committed by his son.\n \nS15, Ep2 - Apr. 5, 2010 - If Dogs Run Free: Part 2\nFrost becomes engaged to Christine Moorehead while trying to put crime kingpin Gerry Berland behind bars and trying to unmask a copycat killer.\n\nThis torrent includes the .xml and .jpg files for the WDTV Live SMP media library feature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1839fcc3c99b9ec0cf02141ac7907fc1e9ab4615","amp;dn":"A+Touch+of+Frost+-+Season+15","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1839fcc3c99b9ec0cf02141ac7907fc1e9ab4615","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,57,252,195,201,155,158,192,207,2,20,26,199,144,127,193,233,171,70,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
