Using dramatic reconstructions, documentary filming around the world and cutting-edge computer graphics, he reveals the decisive moments that shaped the world we live in today, telling stories we thought we knew and others we were never told.\n\n\n\n\n2)  Age of Empire \nAndrew Marr tells the story of the first empires which laid the foundations for the modern world.
