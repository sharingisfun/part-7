Blackwelder is the brainchild of American guitarist Andrew Szucs (formerly of Seven Seraphim), and features none other than Primal Fear vocalist Ralf Scheepers. Blackwelder also includes current Primal Fear (and former Angra) drummer Aquiles Priester and Dio Disciples/ex-Yngwie Malmsteen bassist Bjorn Englen. The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album, titled Survival of the Fittest, was mixed by TheocracyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Matt Smith.\n\nGiven the players involved, you have a pretty good idea whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in store on the Blackwelder debut. Survival of the Fittest is undeniably a Heavy Metal album, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one that has elements of Progressive, Power and Neoclassical metal. Szucs brings a high degree of technicality to these songs, and his soloing in particular is jaw-dropping. And of course Priester brings his own impressive technique to the band. Musically, Blackwelder has elements in common with Balance of Power, Pyramaze and especially Yngwie Malmsteen. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s when Ralf ScheepersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instantly recognizable vocals come in that you start thinking power metal. He brings tremendous power and an additional level of melody to these songs. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his presence that really elevates this album to Ã¢â‚¬Å“must hearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ status.\n\nHigh points on Survival of the Fittest include leadoff track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Night of New Moon,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Remember the TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and closer Ã¢â‚¬Å“Judgment Day,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which probably comes closest of all these songs to a Primal Fear sound. The instrumental Ã¢â‚¬Å“AdeturiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is also pretty remarkable from a purely technical standpoint.\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a fan of any of the players involved, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to want to hear this. Blackwelder may not be breaking any new ground, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always good to hear first-rate musicians paired with a vocalist of ScheepersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s caliber. And hey, if you ever wondered what an Yngwie Malmsteen album might sound like with Ralf Scheepers on vocals, Survival of the Fittest is about as close as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to get!\n\nGenre: Heavy Metal, Progressive Metal, Neoclassical Metal\n\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.
