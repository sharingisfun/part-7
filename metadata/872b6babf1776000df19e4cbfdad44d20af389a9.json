Inuk (Quinn) is a typical Eskimo hunter, living proudly as his ancestors did, eking out an existence on the frozen Canadian tundra. When Inuk takes his wife and mother-in-law to a trading post to exchange furs, the family meets a friendly priest (Marco Guglielmi). In time-honored Eskimo custom, Inuk offers the missionary his wife&amp;#039;s sexual favors. Offended by the man&amp;#039;s rejection, Inuk kills him. Having broken Western law, Inuk is pursued by two Mounties (Peter O&amp;#039;Toole and Carlo Giustini). Slowed down by his wife&amp;#039;s elderly mother, he sends the woman out on the ice to perish, another of his people&amp;#039;s ancient traditions. The police capture Inuk, but the lawmen and their prisoner encounter severe weather. The Savage Innocents (1959) was the feature debut of actor O&amp;#039;Toole, who objected to the overdubbing of his voice in the finished film.--Karl Williams, All Movie Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n(screens are from a slightly lesser quality rip)\n\n\n\n~~~~~~ The Savage Innocents.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,032,239,104                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:40:58                \nFrame Count:....................................151432             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................704                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................288                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................2.444                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1225                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.242&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................125                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2    \n\n---my rip---\n\n--enjoy--\n\n       \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:872b6babf1776000df19e4cbfdad44d20af389a9","amp;dn":"Nicholas+Ray+-+The+Savage+Innocents+%281959%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"872b6babf1776000df19e4cbfdad44d20af389a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,43,107,171,241,119,96,0,223,25,228,203,253,173,68,210,10,243,137,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
