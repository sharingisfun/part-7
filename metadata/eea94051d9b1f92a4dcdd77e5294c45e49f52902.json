The hit single, Wasted, is already deemed to be remembered as this year's song of the summer. The music video surpassed two million views in less than two weeks. Tastemakers and gatekeepers can't stop singing its praises. Tiesto also invited some of dance music's most notable names to collaborate with him on A Town Called Paradise. He joins forces with the likes of Hardwell, Sultan + Ned Shepard, Firebeatz, MOTi, Kaaze, and Dzeko &amp; Torres on the production side. The vocal cameos also shine brightly. In addition to Koma and Icona Pop, he tapped the talents of Ladyhawke, Zac Barnett [American Authors], and Krewella.\n\n\n\n1. Red Lights\n2. Footprints ft. Cruickshank\n3. Light Years Away ft.
