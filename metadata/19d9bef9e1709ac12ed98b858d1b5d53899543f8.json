Before Rumble, electric guitars were used to produce clean sounds and jazz chords. Wray pioneered fuzz-tone and was the first guitarist to use power chords to play a song's melody.\n\nPete Townshend stated in liner notes for a 1974 Wray album, &quot;He is the king; if it hadn't been for Link Wray and 'Rumble,' I would have never picked up a guitar.&quot; Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix, Marc Bolan, Neil Young and Bob Dylan have all cited Wray as an influence. He was named as one of the hundred greatest guitarists of all time by Rolling Stone magazine, but still has not yet been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He is, however, a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.&quot;\n\nDisc 1:\n01 La De Da   \n02 Take Me Home Jesus   \n03 Juke Box Mama   \n04 Rise And Fall Of Jimmy Stokes   \n05 Fallin' Rain   \n06 Fire And Brimstone   \n07 Ice People   \n08 God Out West   \n09 Crowbar   \n10 Black River Swamp   \n11 Tail Dragger   \n12 Hobo Man   \n13 I'm So Glad, I'm So Proud   \n14 Georgia Pines   \n15 Water Boy   \n16 Alabama Electric Circus   \n17 Take My Hand (Precious Lord) \n\nDisc 2:\n01 Walkin' In The Arizona Sun   \n02 Scorpio Woman   \n03 All Because Of A Woman   \n04 On The Run   \n05 Days Before Custer   \n06 Be What You Want To   \n07 All Cried Out   \n08 Tucson, Arizona   \n09 River Bend   \n10 You Walked By   \n11 Walk Easy, Walk Slow   \n12 Morning   \n13 It Was A Bad Scene   \n14 Good Time Joe   \n15 Walkin' Bulldog   \n16 I Got To Ramble   \n17 Backwoods Preacher Man   \n18 She's That Kind Of Woman   \n19 Super 88   \n20 Rumble \n\nIf you like the album, buy it and support the artist!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19d9bef9e1709ac12ed98b858d1b5d53899543f8","amp;dn":"Link+Wray+-+Guitar+Preacher+%5B2CD%5D+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19d9bef9e1709ac12ed98b858d1b5d53899543f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,217,190,249,225,112,154,193,46,217,139,133,141,27,93,83,137,149,67,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
