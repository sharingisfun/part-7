Those listening to This Is Hardcore expecting another dose of the band's trademark perky observation were in for a big surprise.\n\nIf the strangely depressing single &quot;Help The Aged&quot; that preceded the album had not set alarm bells ringing, the message and mood of oppressive gothic-pop opener &quot;The Fear&quot; was unmistakable: &quot;This is the sound of someone losing the plot/Making out they're okay when they're not/You're gonna like it, but not a lot,&quot; warned Cocker. He wasn't kidding. Pulp had at this point overdosed on fame. &quot;Party Hard&quot; hinted at the excess that fostered this atmosphere with detached self-disgust.\n\nThis Is Hardcore is a profoundly unsettling piece of work (only Nirvana's In Utero matches it in recent times), from the celebrity-as-pornographer motif of the title track, to the nagging pessimism of the final song, which jarred so brutally with the manically upbeat mood of Blair's Britain. The album is also Pulp's most musically accomplished: &quot;Seductive Barry&quot; spools with relentless, mesmerizing menace; &quot;Party Hard&quot; is a deranged funk workout.\n\nAlthough it reached No.1, the album tanked compared to its predecessor, Different Class, which was probably exactly what Pulp wanted-and needed (though the cover sparked a minor furor, as the band were accused of pornographic exploitation themselves). Play it back-to-back with Different Class for a crash course on the perils of getting what you want, whenever you want, with whomever you want.\n\nTracks:\n\nCD1\n\n101 - Pulp - The Fear.flac\n102 - Pulp - Dishes.flac\n103 - Pulp - Party Hard.flac\n104 - Pulp - Help The Aged.flac\n105 - Pulp - This Is Hardcore.flac\n106 - Pulp - TV Movie.flac\n107 - Pulp - A Little Soul.flac\n108 - Pulp - I'm A Man.flac\n109 - Pulp - Seductive Barry.flac\n110 - Pulp - Sylvia.flac\n111 - Pulp - Glory Days.flac\n112 - Pulp - The Day After The Revolution.flac\n\n\nCD2\n\n201 - Pulp - The Fear.flac\n202 - Pulp - Live Bed Show.flac\n203 - Pulp - TV Movie.flac\n204 - Pulp - A Little Soul.flac\n205 - Pulp - Party Hard.flac\n206 - Pulp - Help The Aged.flac\n207 - Pulp - Seductive Barry.flac\n\nÃƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ripping logs includedÃƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8faf2b82bbc25d2a9685352e9a7de970fce15634","amp;dn":"Pulp+-+This+Is+Hardcore+%5B1998%5D+%28Limited+UK+Issue+With+This+Is+Gl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8faf2b82bbc25d2a9685352e9a7de970fce15634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,175,43,130,187,194,93,42,150,133,53,46,154,125,233,112,252,225,86,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
