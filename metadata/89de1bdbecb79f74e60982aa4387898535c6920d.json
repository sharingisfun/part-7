It tells you what Six Sigma is and is not, what it does and how it does it, and what your role likely will be in the implementation process. \n\nEckes uses straightforward definitions and in-depth examples to outline the processes, impact, and desired end result of implementation-eliminating the confusion and fear many feel when first introduced to Six Sigma. If you need to understand the basics, then this is the book for you. Topics include:\n* The origins and history of Six Sigma\n* Business Process Management: Six Sigma as management philosophy\n* Individual and team tactics\n* The ten basic tools each team member needs to succeed\n* How you and your organization must change to make Six Sigma work \n\nAbout author:\nGeorge Eckes (Superior, CO) is founder, President, and CEO of Eckes &amp; Associates, Inc., a Colorado-based consulting group specializing in results driven by continuous improvement, Six Sigma training and implementation, organizational development, and change management. \n\nAmong his clients in the United States, Asia, Europe, and Mexico are Volvo Trucks North America, Honeywell, Wells Fargo, and General Electric.
