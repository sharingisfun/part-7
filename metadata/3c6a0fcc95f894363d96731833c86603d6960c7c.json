At one time too stigmatized to be mentioned in polite conversation, depression is now discussed frankly in the media, and advertisements for drug therapy appear everywhere. The third edition of this widely acclaimed book reflects changes in how mood disorders are thought about, and how they are treated. \nDr. Francis Mark Mondimore, author of the best-selling book Bipolar Disorder: A Guide for Patients and Families, here explains depressionÃ¢â‚¬â€its causes and symptoms, and its treatment. He discusses depression in all age groups and in both sexes, as well as bipolar disorder, seasonal affective disorders, and depression that accompanies illness. This edition encompasses more than a decade of new research, advances in pharmacology, and changes in public perception. \nThe past ten years have seen the release of new forms of the major antidepressants as well as other promising new avenues in pharmaceutical treatments. For example &quot;atypical&quot; or &quot;second generation&quot; antidepressants, such as venlafaxine and duloxetine, provide different ways of manipulating the chemical systems in the brain concerned with mood. And there have been significant advances in the use of MAO inhibitors, now available in patch form. \nDr. Mondimore reviews these and other pharmacological therapies as part of a comprehensive approach to treatment that includes psychotherapy, family and community support, and lifestyle changes. Full of information compassionately presented, this guide provides hope and help to patients and their families.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c6a0fcc95f894363d96731833c86603d6960c7c","amp;dn":"Depression%2C+the+Mood+Disease+%28A+Johns+Hopkins+Press+Health+Book%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c6a0fcc95f894363d96731833c86603d6960c7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,106,15,204,149,248,148,54,61,150,115,24,51,200,102,3,214,150,12,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
