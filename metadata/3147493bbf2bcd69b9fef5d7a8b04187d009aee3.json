Through her novels, short stories, and essays, Gordimer revealed the prejudices and ideologies, the tensions and stresses of life in a racially divided society and the corrupting and corrosive effects of the apartheid system.  Always questioning power relations and truth, she tells stories of ordinary people, revealing moral ambiguities and choices.  Her characterization is nuanced, revealed more through the choices her characters make than through their claimed identities and beliefs.\r\n\r\nGordimer's activism was not limited to the struggle against apartheid.  She resisted censorship and state control of information, and fostered the literary arts.  A founding member of the Congress of South African Writers, Gordimer was also active in South African letters and international literary organizations, serving as Vice President of International PEN.  In the post-apartheid 1990s and 21st century, Gordimer was active in the HIV/AIDS movement, addressing a significant public health crisis in South Africa.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize, she was the recipient of prestigious literary awards in South Africa, Europe, and the U.S., including a number of annual CNA Literary Awards in South Africa, the W.H. Smith Literary Award, the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, the Booker Prize and the Grand Aigle d'Or.  In 2007 Gordimer was awarded the French Legion of Honour.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in PDF and/or ePUB format as indicated:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    == NOVELS  ==\r\n\r\n* Burger's Daughter (Penguin, 1980) -- PDF + ePUB\r\n\r\n* The Conservationist (Penguin, 1978 / Bloomsbury, 2012) -- PDF + ePUB\r\n\r\n* Get a Life (FSG, 2005) -- ePUB\r\n\r\n* A Guest of Honour (Penguin, 1973 / Bloomsbury, 2012) -- PDF + ePUB\r\n\r\n* The House Gun (FSG, 1998) -- PDF + ePUB\r\n\r\n* July's People (Viking / Jonathan Cape, 1981) -- PDF + ePUB\r\n\r\n* The Late Bourgeois World (Bloomsbury, 2013) -- ePUB\r\n\r\n* The Lying Days (Bloomsbury, 2002) -- ePUB\r\n\r\n* My Son's Story (FSG, 1990 / Penguin, 1991) -- PDF + ePUB\r\n\r\n* No Time Like the Present (FSG, 2012) -- ePUB\r\n\r\n* None to Accompany Me (FSG / Bloomsbury, 1994) -- PDF + ePUB\r\n\r\n* Occasion for Loving (Bloomsbury, 2013) -- ePUB\r\n\r\n* The Pickup (Penguin, 2002) -- PDF + ePUB\r\n\r\n* Something Out There (Penguin, 1985) -- PDF\r\n\r\n* A Sport of Nature (Knopf, 1987) -- PDF + ePUB\r\n\r\n* A World of Strangers (Penguin, 1962) -- PDF + ePUB\r\n\r\n\r\n                                == SHORT STORIES ==\r\n\r\n* Beethoven Was One-Sixteenth Black &amp; Other Stories (Penguin, 2007) -- PDF + ePUB\r\n\r\n* Jump &amp; Other Stories (FSG / Bloomsbury, 1991) -- PDF + ePUB\r\n\r\n* Life Times: Stories, 1952-2007 (Penguin, 2011) -- ePUB\r\n\r\n* Livingstone's Companions: Stories (Viking, 1971) -- PDF\r\n\r\n* Loot &amp; Other Stories (FSG, 2003) -- PDF + ePUB\r\n\r\n* Not For Publication &amp; Other Stories (Viking, 1965) -- PDF\r\n\r\n* A Soldier's Embrace: Stories (Penguin, 1982) -- PDF\r\n\r\n* Why Haven't You Written: Selected Stories, 1950-1972 (Penguin, 1992) -- PDF\r\n\r\n\r\n                            == ESSAYS &amp; NON-FICTION ==\r\n\r\n* The Art of Fiction, No. 88 (Paris Review, Summer 1983).
