Since its inception, the band has comprised vocalist, guitarist and pianist Matthew Bellamy; bassist and backing vocalist Christopher Wolstenholme; and drummer Dominic Howard. Muse are known for their energetic and extravagant live performances and their fusion of many music genres, including progressive rock, classical music and electronica. Muse have released five studio albums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Showbiz (1999); Origin of Symmetry (2001); Absolution (2003); Black Holes and Revelations (2006), which earned the band a Mercury Prize nomination and a third place finish in the NME Albums of the Year list for 2006; and The Resistance (2009).\n\nMuse have won many other music awards throughout their career, including five MTV Europe Music Awards, five Q Awards, six NME Awards, two BRIT awards and four Kerrang! Awards. The majority of their awards can be attributed to their live performances. They have been involved with Teenage Cancer Trust and have performed at the Royal Albert Hall where they donated all money made from the merchandise stands to the charity. On the 25th of September 2008 all three members of the band were awarded Honorary Doctorates of the Arts by Plymouth University.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2f102c9ed478f38cde43107c57a5cc81902cc6f","amp;dn":"Muse+-+The+Resistance+%5B2009%2FMp3%2F320%2FM3U%2FLog%2FCov%2FCD%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2f102c9ed478f38cde43107c57a5cc81902cc6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,241,2,201,237,71,143,56,205,228,49,7,197,122,92,200,25,2,204,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
