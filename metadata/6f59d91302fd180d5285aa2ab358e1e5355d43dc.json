Featuring a variety of artists from Lily Allen, Massive Attack and Ellie Goulding to Katy Perry, Paolo Nutini and Florence &amp; The Machine.

ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a privilege to hear such a diverse and brilliant range of artists singing songs you wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t necessarily associate with them, which makes these performances so unusual and special. This album has really fuelled my passion for live music.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nDermotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always had music in his blood; he kick-started his career as a DJ working for a local radio station, which later led him on to a series of presenting slots with both XFM and Radio 2. DermotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s passion for music has always reflected in his achievements and DermotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s radio 2 show won Music Programme of the Year in 2008 and then again in 2010.\n\nThe Saturday Sessions album launches on October 4th 2010 and is available to buy and download from iTunes, Amazon and all good retailers.\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/aa2a/9fb691a6.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/5886/tracklistxy2.gif[/img]\n\nDisc 1.\n\n1.
