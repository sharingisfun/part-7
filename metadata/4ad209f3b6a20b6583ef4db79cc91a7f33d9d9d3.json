Contemporary Italians touch it for luck before placing a bet. Americans are having it cosmetically enhanced at rates approaching breast enlargement surgery. The female butt, tush, culo, or derriÃ¨re has always inspired awe, fantasy, and slavish devotion.\r\nCuriously, its primary purpose is functional rather than aesthetic: butts balance our bodies while running, according to biologists. But ask any pygophiliacâ€”as fundament fans are clinically termedâ€”and youâ€™ll get the same answer: female hindquarters exist to please the eye, the hands, and parts south. A pert posterior causes instant arousal, as Zora Neale Hurston observed in Their Eyes Were Watching God: &quot;The men noticed her firm buttocks like she had grape fruits in her hip pockets.&quot; Or, as rapper Sir Mix-a-lot proclaimed, &quot;My anaconda donâ€™t want none, unless youâ€™ve got buns, hun.&quot;\r\nHaving all but disappeared from western culture in the breast-obsessed second half of the 20th century, the fully formed fanny is currently enjoying a massive resurgence, attributed by some to American actress Jennifer Lopez, by others to the rise of booty-centric hip hop culture. Yet this rage for shapely butts is nothing new. The ancient Greeks worshipped at the temple of Aphrodite Kallipygos, Goddess of the Beautiful Buttocks, while a womanly rump has always been an object of worship in most of the southern hemisphere.\r\nThe Big Butt Book explores this perennial fascination with female bootyâ€”from small and taut to large and sumptuousâ€”in the fourth installment of Dian Hansonâ€™s critically acclaimed body parts series. Over 400 photos from 1900 to the present day, including works by Elmer Batters, Ellen von Unwerth, Jean-Paul Goude, Ralph Gibson, Richard Kern, Jan Saudek, Ed Fox, Terry Richardson and Sante Dâ€™Orazio, of butts ranging from petite Pam Andersonâ€™s to sumptuous Serena Williamsâ€™, are contextualized by interviews with porn icon John (Buttman) Stagliano, filmmaker Tinto Brass, artist Robert Crumb, bootylicious butt queens Buffie The Body, Coco and Brazilâ€™s Watermelon Woman, plus Eve Howard and her life-long spanking obsession.\r\n\r\nAbout The Author.Editor\r\nDian Hanson produced a variety of menâ€™s magazines from 1976 to 2001, including Juggs, Outlaw Biker, and Leg Show, before becoming TASCHENâ€™s Sexy Book editor.
