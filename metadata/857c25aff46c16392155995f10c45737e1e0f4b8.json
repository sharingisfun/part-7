His three EPs have exploded in his native UK, and the Oxford-born performer and producer is now working on his first full-length album, which he describes as &quot;just dance music,&quot; without any genre associations. In an interview with Spinner, Higginbottom discussed dinosaur costumes, being the son of an Oxford University music professor, teaching children how to play steel pans and not taking the scene too seriously.\n\nLondon, United Kingdom\nTotally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs is a London, UK duo of Edmund Finnis and Orlando Higginbottom. Their music swings between overt musicality and dance. Their live show has toured internationally, featuring bizarre instruments, glitter cannons and, of course, dancing dinosaurs.\n\nTheir second EP, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAll In Two Sixty Dancehalls EPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (2010, Greco-Roman), brought them notoriety. The lead track, Garden, was especially critically aclaimed.\n\nall albums and individual tracks , super new to super old, watch out for there new album in 2012 , ultimate dance and electro rite here!!\n\nVideos open in VLC media player or media player classic - on google \n--------------------------------------\n\nFuture of DUBSTEP     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6624204/Future_Of_Dubstep_2011_(SUPER_NEW__)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6624204/Future_Of_Dubstep_2011_(SUPER_NEW__)&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6780143/Future_Of_DUBstep_2012_(ELECTRONIC)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6780143/Future_Of_DUBstep_2012_(ELECTRONIC)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVOLUME 31 - NEW\n\n3 gigs of pure music made by me \nFor more rap music , hip hop , electronic, over 5 genres\nover 3 gigs!\nultimate mixtape \nelectronic, and 80s music all in one\nu gotta get this\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6746589/Digital_Crack_Vol_31_-_Ultimate_Hip_Hop_-_Electro_MiXtape_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6746589/Digital_Crack_Vol_31_-_Ultimate_Hip_Hop_-_Electro_MiXtape_&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\ncheck out my other unique cool torrents\namerican greed season 4\ncrank yankers season 3\njersey shore season 4\nphil hendrie show all years\nPerfect Photo Suite 6\nand over 40 gigs of music !\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/atndigcrk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/atndigcrk/&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:857c25aff46c16392155995f10c45737e1e0f4b8","amp;dn":"Totally+Enormous+Extinct+Dinosaurs+-+All+Songs+and+Videos%21%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"857c25aff46c16392155995f10c45737e1e0f4b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,124,37,175,244,108,22,57,33,85,153,95,16,196,87,55,225,224,244,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
