This book is also ideal for a wide range of amateur and professional woodworkers.\n\nVolume 3 builds on the fundamental knowledge introduced in volume 1, and accompanies volume 2 with coverage of additional advanced topics and procedures, including working with particular door and window types. The reader is shown how to apply the basic theory introduced in volume 1 to actual carpentry and joinery practice in a highly illustrated, easily accessible text.\n\nThis second edition has been fully updated in line with changes to the Building Regulations and current legislation, the third edition also incorporates developments in current best practice, with a comprehensive match to the latest qualifications in Wood Occupations.\n\n\nBy Brian Porter, Chris Tooke\nPublished by Routledge in 2007\nPDF, 417 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80977a646b93693949346f4c0333c59d5a7fd682","amp;dn":"Carpentry+and+Joinery%2CVol+3%28PDF%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80977a646b93693949346f4c0333c59d5a7fd682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,151,122,100,107,147,105,57,73,52,111,76,3,51,197,157,90,127,214,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
