This is a very comprehensive and thoughtfully chosen package. The selections run the gamut from &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot; to &quot;Love Hangover&quot; to &quot;I'm Coming Out&quot; to Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers' &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; and Michael Jackson's &quot;Muscles.&quot; It features her duets with Lionel Richie and Marvin Gaye, &quot;Endless Love&quot; and &quot;You Are Everything,&quot; respectively, and &quot;I'm Gonna Make You Love,&quot; a duet with Eddie Kendricks credited as Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes and the Temptations. Ross' compelling soprano is often imitated, but has never been duplicated as successfully by anybody, and that includes her namesake, Jackie Ross (&quot;Selfish One&quot;). This is as good as it gets. Compiling a more complete and pleasing package with the same number of tracks to work with will never happen. The circus-sounding &quot;The Happening&quot; is a nuisance, but you can skip or program it out entirely if it bothers you.&quot;\n\nTRACK LIST\nLove &amp; Life - The Very Best of Diana Ross\n=========================================\n\nDisc 1 - Life:\n\n01.
