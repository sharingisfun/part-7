Druuna is the main character, and has starred in eight volumes of the Morbus Gravis  series between 1985 and 2003: Morbus Gravis, Morbus Gravis 2: Druuna, Creatura, Carnivora, Mandragora, Aphrodisia, The Forgotten Planet and Clone.&quot;\n\nThis is the complete series in french language, totally uncensored. I got the individual files from various sources and had to exchange some corrupt files, but now its all there. I don't have info about the original scanners, but lots of kudos for the work.\nSince you normally only find the censored versions of this CB, i decided to make them available in their original form.\n\nFormat: *.cbr (i recommend ComicRack, great tool for reading &amp; archiving)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0c97566b7728d1e3d380f252963fe5cea6f5f3e","amp;dn":"Paolo+Eleuteri+Serpieri+-+Druuna+%5Bcomplete%2C+uncensored%2C+french%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0c97566b7728d1e3d380f252963fe5cea6f5f3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,201,117,102,183,114,141,30,61,56,15,37,41,99,254,92,234,111,95,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
