It's like we are there with them.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\n\nBy &quot;beatnix8\n\nIt doesn't matter what you may think of Elvis, this album is the holy grail of modern music. Elvis sings everything from r&amp;b to spiritual. Jerry Lee is great on the piano and holds his own against Carl, and Johnny. But, it's Elvis who steals the show. Carl is the only other star at this impromptu session (Jerry Lee, and Johnny Cash are relative unknowns, outside of the south at this point of recording.) Elvis who had just returned to Memphis stops in to Sun Records to say hello to Sam (Phillips) and Carl, during their recording session. Jerry Lee (who had only been signed with Sun for only 2 weeks at this point) is oviously awed by Elvis and his fame, he hangs on Elvis's every word. Johnny Cash is called in after the jam session had already started, by Sam Phillips. Cash comes in towards the end of the session. Over all this is THE MUST HAVE album if there ever was one. If you are a fan of rock music, YOU MUST HAVE THIS ALBUM. AM I MAKING MY SELF CLEAR? Until someone digs up the 65' Elvis &amp; The Beatles jam session this CD will remain the holy grail of rock &amp; roll.
