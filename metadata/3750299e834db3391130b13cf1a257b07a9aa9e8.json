Chosen by the Master in a mysterious inception ceremony, Rithmatists have the power to infuse life into two-dimensional figures known as Chalklings. Rithmatists are humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only defense against the Wild ChalklingsÃ¢â‚¬â€merciless creatures that leave mangled corpses in their wake. Having nearly overrun the territory of Nebrask, the Wild Chalklings now threaten all of the American Isles.\n\nAs the son of a lowly chalkmaker at Armedius Academy, Joel can only watch as Rithmatist students study the magical art that he would do anything to practice. Then students start disappearingÃ¢â‚¬â€kidnapped from their rooms at night, leaving trails of blood. Assigned to help the professor who is investigating the crimes, Joel and his friend Melody find themselves on the trail of an unexpected discoveryÃ¢â‚¬â€one that will change RithmaticsÃ¢â‚¬â€and their worldÃ¢â‚¬â€forever.\n\nBestselling author Brandon Sanderson brings his unique brand of epic storytelling to the teen audience with an engrossing tale of danger and suspenseÃ¢â‚¬â€the first of a series. With his trademark skills in world-building, Sanderson has created a magic system that is so inventive and detailed that that readers who appreciate games of strategy and tactics just may want to bring Rithmatics to life in our world.\n\nAudible Audio Edition\nListening Length: 10 hours and 26 minutes\nProgram Type: Audiobook\nVersion: Unabridged\nPublisher: Audible Ltd\nAudible.com Release Date: May 28, 2013\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
