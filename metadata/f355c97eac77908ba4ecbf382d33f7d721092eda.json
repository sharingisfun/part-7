IAuthor Adam Crespi constructs a city block in 3ds Max utilizing low-polygon modeling and advanced texturing techniques. The course shows how to model common city elements such as buildings, intersections, curbs, and roofs and explains how to expand a city quickly and easily by reusing existing geometry in a modular way. The course also sheds light on simulating real-world detail with baking, lighting, and ambient occlusion techniques and offers a series of best practices for exporting to the Unity gaming engine.\n\nTopics include:\n   Understanding the design process and software requirements\n   Analyzing concept art for texture and key shadow detail\n   Planning differently styled buildings\n   Laying out city blocks\n   Organizing construction elements and models using layers\n   Cloning geometry and texture\n   Testing the module for correct floor-to-floor heights\n   Arranging, aligning and cloning modular elements\n   Building a texture library\n   Creating stone, wood, and brick textures\n   Constructing texture sheets\n   Drawing detail\n   Using occlusion as a foundation for dirt\n   Preparing for Unity as a world builder\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f355c97eac77908ba4ecbf382d33f7d721092eda","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Creating+Urban+Game+Environments+in+3DS+Max","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f355c97eac77908ba4ecbf382d33f7d721092eda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,85,201,126,172,119,144,139,164,236,191,56,45,51,247,215,33,9,46,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
