This book systematically covers the use of US in all organ systems throughout childhood. After discussion of the basics, including physics, artifacts, and procedural details, decision making regarding the use of US is elucidated by discussing next diagnostic steps based on recommended imaging algorithms. The indications and prerequisites for a particular examination are listed, and practical tips and tricks are highlighted. The normal, age-dependent findings and typical appearances in different pathologies are then presented and illustrated by numerous high-quality images. Particular emphasis is placed on those findings that differ from the adult US appearances.\n\nPediatric Ultrasound will prove an indispensable source of information for radiology residents, experienced (pediatric) radiologists, sonographers, pediatricians, and all other physicians who deal with children in their daily practice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c55958ba40d99c580249a4d058f14078108c398e","amp;dn":"Pediatric+Ultrasound+%28Springer%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c55958ba40d99c580249a4d058f14078108c398e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,89,88,186,64,217,156,88,2,73,164,208,88,241,64,120,16,140,57,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
