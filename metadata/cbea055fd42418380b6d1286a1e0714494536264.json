By combining Alice Cooper's shock rock with the bluesy, metallic stomp of the New York Dolls and Aerosmith, they helped establish hair metal as a commercial genre, sending their first five albums to platinum status in the process. Such success was at least partially due to MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e's reputation as a riotous pack of rabble-rousers, replete with drug addictions, near-death experiences, groupie encounters, and celebrity girlfriends. Of course, that same self-indulgence nearly derailed the band, forcing the musicians to embrace sobriety during the creation of their most successful album to date, 1989's Dr. Feelgood. Like most hair metal bands, MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e's album sales waned during the 1990s, as the popularity of grunge overshadowed most of the music that immediately prefaced it. Nevertheless, the band soldiered through the decade with modest success, releasing two gold-selling albums along the way. The new millennium brought similar luck, as MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e established themselves as a fashionable touring act (with CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e Fest becoming the summer's highest-grossing festival in 2008) while continuing to release new material.\n\n\n\nRipped With:\t\tdBpoweramp\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac Perfect (Lossless) Level 8\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags &amp; Extraction Log\nLabel:\t\t\tHip-O\nCatalog:\t\t440067635-2\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.
