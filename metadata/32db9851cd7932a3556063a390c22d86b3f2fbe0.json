Selections from those performances were released on two full-length LPs, WALTZ FOR DEBBY and Sunday AT THE VILLAGE VANGUARD, both of which went on to become landmark jazz albums from the era. The three-disc COMPLETE VILLAGE VANGUARD RECORDINGS provides a valuable service by presenting all five sets in their complete and original sequence, with crisp remastered sound, a previously unissued take (Scott LaFaro's &quot;Gloria's Step&quot;), and snippets of on-stage patter.\n\nMuch has been made of the chemistry between Evans, bassist LaFaro, and drummer Paul Motian, and little of it has been overblown. The three make intuitive, shape-shifting music that breaks new ground with its subtle, sophisticated rhythmic interplay and achingly lyrical beauty. Evans's playing, informed by a Chopin-esque delicacy as much as by post-bop dynamism, is a case study of the jazz ideal achieved. The music, the improved sound, and the chance to have the complete date under one cover make this set a must. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nThis is the remastered set that features 20 bit k2 super coding. It is the complete days worth of recording of this legendary session, warts and all. One of the warts is a 3 second power outage during the first part of disc one-- it's not a defect in the ripping or the the cd itself, just part of the recording.
