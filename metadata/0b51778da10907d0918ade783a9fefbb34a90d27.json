In Minnesota, Virgil Flowers gets a message from Lucas Davenport: YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re about to get a visitor. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an Israeli cop, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tailing a man whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smuggled out an extraordinary relicÃ¢â‚¬â€a copper scroll revealing startling details about the man known as King Solomon.\n\nWait a minute, laughs Virgil. Is this one of those Da Vinci Code deals? The secret scroll, the blockbuster revelation, the teams of murderous bad guys? Should I be boning up on my Bible verses?\n\nHe looks at the cop. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not laughing. As it turns out, there are very bad men chasing the relic, and they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the way or what they have to do to get it. Maybe Virgil should start praying.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
