The Ramones is all about speed, hooks, stupidity, and simplicity. The songs are imaginative reductions of early rock &amp; roll, girl group pop, and surf rock. Not only is the music boiled down to its essentials, but the Ramones offer a twisted, comical take on pop culture with their lyrics, whether it's the horror schlock of &quot;I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement,&quot; the gleeful violence of &quot;Beat on the Brat,&quot; or the maniacal stupidity of &quot;Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue.&quot; And the cover of Chris Montez's &quot;Let's Dance&quot; isn't a throwaway -- with its single-minded beat and lyrics, it encapsulates everything the group loves about pre-Beatles rock &amp; roll. They don't alter the structure, or the intent, of the song, they simply make it louder and faster. And that's the key to all of the Ramones' music -- it's simple rock &amp; roll, played simply, loud, and very, very fast. None of the songs clock in at any longer than two and half minutes, and most are considerably shorter. In comparison to some of the music the album inspired, The Ramones sounds a little tame -- it's a little too clean, and compared to their insanely fast live albums, it even sounds a little slow -- but there's no denying that it still sounds brilliantly fresh and intoxicatingly fun.\n\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img83.imageshack.us/img83/846/ramonesfrontpy6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img83.imageshack.us/img83/846/ramonesfrontpy6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n01.
