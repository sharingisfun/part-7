And the music suffers for it. Perhaps Sixx didn&amp;#039;t\nwant to romanticize addiction and ill behavior by unleashing a\nseries of rockers that would send fists high in the air and let\nthe spirit, at least for a moment, soar while the listener\nstruggled to better understand the seductive lure of dependence\nand decadence. (If anyone cares that much--this is rock &amp; roll,\nafter all, and not Oprah.) Instead, Sixx dresses the songs in the\ntrappings of contemporary pop so that &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; &quot;Life is\nBeautiful&quot; and &quot;Accidents Can Happen&quot; sound like lite imitations\nof the lesser bands that have captured the public&amp;#039;s imagination in\nthe wake of the CrÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â¿e&amp;#039;s inexplicable absence from the recording\nstudio. (&quot;Permission&quot; may even be Sixx&amp;#039;s first stab at getting\nairplay on CMT.) The true rockers, far too slender in number, are\nhalf-realized and pallid; the lyrics are overly diaristic (yes)\nand fail to live up to Sixx&amp;#039;s vintage street sophistication\n(&quot;Dancing on Glass&quot; and &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot;). The Heroin Diaries\ncomes off more like an affectless pity party than a walk on the\nwild side.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7d393ca0e5fba59946316425a1041731ad4685c","amp;dn":"Sixx_A.M.-The_Heroin_Diaries-%28Deluxe_Edition%29-2CD-2008-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7d393ca0e5fba59946316425a1041731ad4685c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,211,147,202,14,95,186,89,148,99,22,66,90,16,65,115,26,212,104,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
