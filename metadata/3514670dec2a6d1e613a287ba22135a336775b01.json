Not much more than 72 hours have been spent developing it)\n\nW, S, A, D and Left Click to fire.\n\nPress 1 and 2 to switch weapons.\n\nSuper Wolfenstein 3D is a loving reimagining of the classic Wolfenstein 3D game by ID Software, but with the big difference of it having realistic physics.\n\nIf the state of the art physics of the original game wasn't enough physics for you, then this is the reimagining of Wolfenstein 3D that you've been waiting for!\n\nAll the glitches! All the Nazis! All the physics!\n\nThis game was made for the Indies VS PewDiePie jam. The main downloadable is a slightly updated build with a lot of gameplay kinks smoothed out. It's a LOT more fun now (though the final baddie can't have his guns disarmed).\n\n\nThis game was made by Free Lives. We develop the game &quot;Broforce&quot; most days.\n\n\nGoogle search &quot;Broforce&quot; it is an amazingly fun game, especially with some friends!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3514670dec2a6d1e613a287ba22135a336775b01","amp;dn":"Super+Wolfenstein+HD+%28PostJam+B%29+by+Free+Lives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3514670dec2a6d1e613a287ba22135a336775b01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,20,103,13,236,42,109,30,97,58,40,123,162,33,53,163,54,119,91,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
