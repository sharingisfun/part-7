In this tutorial we'll do just that as we create a little creature from base geometry to finished painted sculpt. \n\nWe'll cover methods of working with geometry. We'll learn to shape and sculpt our mesh. We'll add high-frequency detail using layers and talk about creating UVs. We'll also paint a texture for our creature and learn to use photographs to add to those textures. \n\nThis step-by-step tutorial is designed to be a quick look at ZBrush to allow you to get the feel of working on a whole project, without bogging down in the details of the interface or blasting you with every workflow possibility. Once you're done, we encourage you to go deeper with the Introduction to ZBrush, Quick Start to ZBrush, or any of our project based tutorials.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bf077c2f4fc0efcc662c0a349478b5aa61779b3","amp;dn":"Your+First+Day+in+ZBrush+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bf077c2f4fc0efcc662c0a349478b5aa61779b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,240,119,194,244,252,14,252,198,98,192,163,73,71,139,90,166,23,121,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
