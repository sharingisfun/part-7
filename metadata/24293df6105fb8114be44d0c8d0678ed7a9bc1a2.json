The band's current line-up consists of vocalist John &quot;Harv&quot; Harbinson, bassist Graham McNulty, former Sweet Savage drummer Davy &quot;Basher&quot; Bates, plus guitarist Steve Moore.\n\nThe band have, to date, released four studio albums, 2007's Caught In The Act, followed by 2010's Death Dealer and 2012's Zero To Rage, released under SPV Records, and their latest album Three Kings released on Metal Nation Records. The band have enjoyed considerable success, playing major rock festivals such as Sweden Rock. Firefest, Z-Rock, Raismes Fest and Wacken Open Air, as well as performing extensively across the UK and Europe. Their releases and performances have been met with general critical acclaim from publications such as Classic Rock. Two albums have had covers designed by renowned fantasy artist Rodney Matthews, with the latest album featuring artwork by John Harbinson himself.\n\nOther notable activities for the band have included performing as George Lynch's band, the &quot;Lynch Mob&quot;, and supporting Y&amp;T, White Lion, Tesla, Stryper, Sebastian Bach and Saxon.\n\nInitially beginning as a studio-only band crafting keyboard-driven AOR style rock, culminating in the release of the well-received Caught In The Act, Stormzone have taken a distinctive turn in recent years, focusing on a more guitar-heavy, NWOBHM style classic metal sound, with power metal influences. This re-invention of the band's sound has seen them enjoy considerable success, starting with a record contract with SPV/Steamhammer Records, and later with Metal Nations Records, under the management of Jess Cox (Neat Records/ original Tygers Of Pan Tang vocalist)\n\nTracklist\n1.
