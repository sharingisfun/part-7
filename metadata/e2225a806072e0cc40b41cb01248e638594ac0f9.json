Though CCR was very much a group in their tight, punchy arrangements, their vision was very much singer, songwriter, guitarist, and leader John Fogerty's. Fogerty's classic compositions for Creedence both evoked enduring images of Americana and reflected burning social issues of the day. The band's genius was their ability to accomplish this with the economic, primal power of a classic rockabilly ensemble.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\t16316-1/2\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.86% CDDA &amp; 99.77% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Fortunate Son\n02.Up Around The Bend\n03.Run Through The Jungle\n04.Who'll Stop The Rain\n05.Have You Ever Seen The Rain\n06.Lookin' Out My Back Door\n07.I Put A Spell On You\n08.Cotton Fields\n09.Down On The Corner\n10.Green River\n11.I Heard It Through The Grapevine\n12.Travelin' Band\n13.Bad Moon Rising\n14.Born On The Bayou\n15.Proud Mary\n16.Suzie Q.
