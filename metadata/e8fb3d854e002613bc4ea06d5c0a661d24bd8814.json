Drawing on revelatory new materialsâ€”including newly discovered U.S. government documents, U.S. and European intelligence sources, the personal correspondence and journals of Allen Dullesâ€™s wife and mistress, and exclusive interviews with the children of prominent CIA officialsâ€”Talbot reveals the underside of one of Americaâ€™s most powerful and influential figures.\r\n\r\nDullesâ€™s decade as the director of the CIAâ€”which he used to further his public and private agendasâ€”were dark times in American politics. Calling himself â€œthe secretary of state of unfriendly countries,â€ Dulles saw himself as above the elected law, manipulating and subverting American presidents in the pursuit of his personal interests and those of the wealthy elite he counted as his friends and clientsâ€”colluding with Nazi-controlled cartels, German war criminals, and Mafiosi in the process. Targeting foreign leaders for assassination and overthrowing nationalist governments not in line with his political aims, Dulles employed those same tactics to further his goals at home, Talbot charges, offering shocking new evidence in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\r\n\r\nAn exposÃ© of American power that is as disturbing as it is timely, The Devilâ€™s Chessboard is a provocative and gripping story of the rise of the national security stateâ€”and the battle for Americaâ€™s soul","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8fb3d854e002613bc4ea06d5c0a661d24bd8814","amp;dn":"The+Devil%27s+Chessboard++by+David+Talbot+++2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8fb3d854e002613bc4ea06d5c0a661d24bd8814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,251,61,133,78,0,38,19,188,78,160,109,92,10,102,29,36,189,136,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
