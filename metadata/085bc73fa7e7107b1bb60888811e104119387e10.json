Jackson says of course he'll follow her anywhere and, because it's also Valentine's Day, he gives her a diamond pendant. Molly surprises him with a puppy. The romance is soon interrupted with the worst kind of Valentine's gift: Jackson's ex, Vanessa, shows up with a DNA test proving he's the true father of her baby. Jackson insists that Vanessa was a one-night stand before he and Molly got serious, but Molly is livid. She leaves puppy, pendant, and Jackson in San Francisco and heads for Seattle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:085bc73fa7e7107b1bb60888811e104119387e10","amp;dn":"Heart.Felt.2016.HDTV.x264-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"085bc73fa7e7107b1bb60888811e104119387e10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,91,199,63,167,231,16,123,27,182,8,136,129,30,16,65,25,56,126,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
