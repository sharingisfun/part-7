Ã¢â‚¬Å“A tale so gripping that one questions the need for fiction when real life is so plump with drama and intrigueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Associated Press).\n\nDoris Kearns GoodwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Bully Pulpit is a dynamic history of the first decade of the Progressive era, that tumultuous time when the nation was coming unseamed and reform was in the air.\n\nThe story is told through the intense friendship of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard TaftÃ¢â‚¬â€a close relationship that strengthens both men before it ruptures in 1912, when they engage in a brutal fight for the presidential nomination that divides their wives, their children, and their closest friends, while crippling the progressive wing of the Republican Party, causing Democrat Woodrow Wilson to be elected, and changing the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history.\n\nThe Bully Pulpit is also the story of the muckraking press, which arouses the spirit of reform that helps Roosevelt push the government to shed its laissez-faire attitude toward robber barons, corrupt politicians, and corporate exploiters of our natural resources. The muckrakers are portrayed through the greatest group of journalists ever assembled at one magazineÃ¢â‚¬â€Ida Tarbell, Ray Stannard Baker, Lincoln Steffens, and William Allen WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â€teamed under the mercurial genius of publisher S.S. McClure.\n\nGoodwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narrative is founded upon a wealth of primary materials. The correspondence of more than four hundred letters between Roosevelt and Taft begins in their early thirties and ends only months before RooseveltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. Edith Roosevelt and Nellie Taft kept diaries. The muckrakers wrote hundreds of letters to one another, kept journals, and wrote their memoirs. The letters of Captain Archie Butt, who served as a personal aide to both Roosevelt and Taft, provide an intimate view of both men.\n\nThe Bully Pulpit, like GoodwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant chronicles of the Civil War and World War II, exquisitely demonstrates her distinctive ability to combine scholarly rigor with accessibility. It is a major work of historyÃ¢â‚¬â€an examination of leadership in a rare moment of activism and reform that brought the country closer to its founding ideals.\n\nKirkus Reviews\n\nSwiftly moving account of a friendship that turned sour, broke a political party in two and involved an insistent, omnipresent press corps. Cantor and Boehner? No: Teddy and Taft. Pulitzer PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning historian Goodwin (Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, 2005, etc.) may focus on the great men (and occasionally women) of history, but she is the foremost exponent of a historiographic school that focuses on the armies of aides and enactors that stand behind them. In this instance, one of the principal great men would revel in the title: Theodore Roosevelt wanted nothing more than to be world-renowned, change the world and occasionally shoot a mountain lion. His handpicked successor, William Howard Taft, was something else entirely: He wished to fade into legal scholarship and was very happy in later life to be named to the Supreme Court. The two began as friends of what Taft called &quot;close and sweet intimacy,&quot; and the friendship ended--Goodwin evokes this exquisitely well in her closing pages--with a guarded chance encounter in a hotel that slowly thawed but too late. A considerable contributor to the split was TR's progressivism, his trust-busting and efforts to improve the lot of America's working people, which Taft was disinclined to emulate. Moreover, Taft did not warm to TR's great talent, which was to enlist journalists to his cause; problems of objectivity aside, they provided him with the &quot;bully pulpit&quot; of Goodwin's title. She populates her pages with sometimes-forgotten heroes of investigative reporting--Ida Tarbell, Ray Blake, Lincoln Steffens--just as much as Roosevelt and Taft and their aides. The result is an affecting portrait of how networks based on genuine liking contribute to the effective functioning of government without requiring reporters to be sycophants or politicians to give up too many secrets. It's no small achievement to have something new to say on Teddy Roosevelt's presidency, but Goodwin succeeds admirably. A notable, psychologically charged study in leadership.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ba62d78a7b2de896aabed23b2423bd070e5536d","amp;dn":"Doris+Kearns+Goodwin+-+The+Bully+Pulpit+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ba62d78a7b2de896aabed23b2423bd070e5536d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,166,45,120,167,178,222,137,106,171,237,35,178,66,59,208,112,229,83,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
