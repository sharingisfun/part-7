The series follows Geary as he leads the fleet through previously unexplored star systems, and to explore the threat of the previously encountered non-human &quot;Enigma&quot; race.\n\nThere are 3 aubiobooks in this series. I suggest reading or listening to the 'Lost Fleet' series first. I have already posted the audiobooks here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8461447/Jack_Campbell_-_The_Lost_Fleet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8461447/Jack_Campbell_-_The_Lost_Fleet&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you enjoy these, there is 1 incomplete spinoff called 'The Lost Stars' (2 books, 1 unreleased).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d183d6836eca84ce41a094ba18f0eeea074048d","amp;dn":"Jack+Campbell+-+Beyond+The+Frontier","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d183d6836eca84ce41a094ba18f0eeea074048d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,24,61,104,54,236,168,76,228,26,9,75,161,143,14,238,160,116,4,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
