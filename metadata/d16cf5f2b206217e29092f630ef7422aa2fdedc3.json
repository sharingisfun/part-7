What if you could no longer summon up any recollections of your mother\\'s embrace, a best friend\\'s confidences, or the moment you first met your spouse? What if you couldn\\'t even remember yourselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½not your name, your school, where you worked, or even the face of the total stranger staring back at you from the mirror?\n\nIf all of these memories were gone, would \\&quot;self\\&quot; even have a meaning?\n\nThe truth is that while you may think of human memory as a capacityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a way to call up important facts or episodes from your pastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½it is much, much more.\n\nYour various memory systems, in fact, provide the continuity of consciousness that allows the concept of \\&quot;you\\&quot; to make sense, creating the ongoing narrative that makes your life truly yours. Without those systems and the overall experience of memory they make possible, you would have no context for the most crucial decisions of your life. You would have to makeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½without the benefit of experience and knowledgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the decisions that determine not only your quality of life, but your very survival. And your ability to learn, or even to form the personality that makes you unique, would similarly be set adrift.\n\nIn Memory and the Human Lifespan, Professor Steve Joordens of the University of Toronto Scarborough, who has been repeatedly honored as both teacher and researcher, leads you on a startling voyage into the human mind, explaining not only how the various aspects of your memory operate, but the impact memory has on your daily experience of life.\n\nHis 24 riveting lectures carefully explain\nthe different kinds of systems that come together to make memory possible;\nhow those systems work together to build and access memories of specific events, solve problems, learn basic tasks like brushing your teeth, or acquire the skills to play a musical instrument;\nthe kinds of memory deficits that result when various parts of the brain are damaged or deteriorate;\nhow memory shapes not only your experience of the past but also of the present, as well as your expectations of the future;\nhow your memory systems develop throughout your life; and much more.\n\nMoreover, by understanding how the brain organizes and encodes information, you can better harness its extraordinary powers to fine-tune how it works for you and use this information to help reshape your very experience of being alive.\n\nStand on the Threshold of Great Discoveries\n\nWhile attempts to grasp and facilitate memory date back at least to classical Greece, only now can we truly begin to understand how memory works, thanks to the advantages of science and technology that have been developing for over a century.\n\nWorking with the latest findings from memory research, Professor Joordens takes you inside the human mind, from infancy to advanced age, with a special emphasis on the variety of experiences that are characteristic of the adult mind. You\\'ll learn\nhow your brain encodes, stores, and retrieves memories;\nthe specialized roles played by your different memory systems, including semantic, episodic, procedural, and implicit memory;\nhow research into the workings of the brainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½once dependent on studying the deficits visited on brain-damaged patientsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½has made extraordinary leaps, with new technologies like functional magnetic resonance imaging allowing doctors to observe the brain at work, with no harm or discomfort to the patient.\n\nSuch scientific advances have given doctors an unprecedented understanding of those deficits. And Professor Joordens makes certain in describing that underlying science that we never lose sight of the human beings who must live with the consequences of their conditions. In an especially poignant portrait, for example, he relates the story of British musician, conductor, and singer Clive Wearing. You learn how a brain infection damaged Wearing\\'s hippocampus, a region deep within the brain that provides, among other things, a gateway from immediate working memory to long-term memory.\n\nDiscover Startling Revelations about Human Memory\n\nEach lecture of Memory and the Human Lifespan startles you with surprising revelations about the extraordinary subject of memory. These include\nthe different aspects of memory that taxi drivers must call on to do their job, as well as the difficulty of mastering the knowledge needed to pass the qualifying exam in LondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a task for which two to four years of study are recommended;\nthe evidence of often-astonishing memory capabilities in animals, including the remarkable feats of a lobster-stealing octopus in Miami;\nhow the principle of perceptual fluency influences your behavior by creating subtle feelings of warm familiarity in many situations in which you aren\\'t even aware it is operating, from writing a story to shopping to making a choice in the voting booth; and\nwhat the latest research about so-called \\&quot;recovered memories\\&quot; and \\&quot;false memories\\&quot; may reveal about the accuracy of episodic memory itself, with implications we would do well to consider in many areas of lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including the courtroom.\n\nWhile Professor Joordens has built these lectures around the latest scientific findings, he has gone to great lengths to make each one absolutely accessible. Every point is clearly explained, and every lecture is enriched with illustrative analogies and vivid anecdotes and examples. It\\'s this same approach that has won him numerous awards and accolades for his teaching, including the President\\'s Teaching AwardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the University of Toronto\\'s highest honorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the Leadership in Faculty Teaching Award.\n\nJust as important, the science is never allowed to overshadow the idea of memory as central to our very humanity. No matter how deeply into research results a lecture may go to explore the construction or retrieval of a memory, Memory and the Human Lifespan always presents the subject as a human experienceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a fascinating, multilayered exploration of yourself that you\\'ll never forget.\n\nAbout Your Professor\n\nDr. Steve Joordens is Professor of Psychology at the University of Toronto Scarborough, where he has taught since 1995. He earned a doctorate in cognitive psychology from the University of Waterloo.\n\nHonored repeatedly as both teacher and researcher, Professor Joordens is on the cutting edge of the emerging field of cognitive prosthetics to assist both learning-disabled patients as well as patients with Alzheimer\\'s disease. He is a frequent speaker at professional conferences, where he consistently earns \\&quot;best in session\\&quot; honors.\n\nIn addition to publishing many articles on human memory, consciousness, and attention in empirical and theoretical psychology journals, Professor Joordens earned both the Premier\\'s Research Excellence Award and the National Technology Innovation AwardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the latter for the creation of an Internet-based educational platform that supports the development of critical thinking and clear communication skills in any size classroom. His teaching skills have also earned him repeated honors, including the President\\'s Teaching Award, his university\\'s highest teaching honor; the Scarborough College Students\\' Union Best Professor Award; a provincially sponsored Leadership in Faculty Teaching Award; and four nominations for Television Ontario\\'s Best Lecturer Competition, which include two Top 10 finishes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d16cf5f2b206217e29092f630ef7422aa2fdedc3","amp;dn":"TTC+AUDIO+-+Memory+and+the+Human+Lifespan+-+Steve+Joordens","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d16cf5f2b206217e29092f630ef7422aa2fdedc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,108,245,242,178,6,33,126,41,9,47,99,14,247,66,42,162,253,237,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
