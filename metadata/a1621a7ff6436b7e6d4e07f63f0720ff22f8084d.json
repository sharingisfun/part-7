The descendant of the woman he wanted to marry already has a boyfriend: a brave young boy named Cody, who lives with his swindler uncle Morty and together they run a tour company called Darkside Tours. Leprechaun soon wakes up, kills a bunch of people and kidnaps his bride to be. It's soon up to Cody to save her, and only wrought iron can destroy a Leprechaun. Morty has an idea, but it soon goes horribly wrong when he gets too greedy. Cody ventures into Leprechaun's home to save Bridget, but little does he know that a leprechaun's home has many surprises","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1621a7ff6436b7e6d4e07f63f0720ff22f8084d","amp;dn":"Leprechaun+2+%281994%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1621a7ff6436b7e6d4e07f63f0720ff22f8084d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,98,26,127,246,67,107,126,109,78,7,246,63,7,32,255,34,248,8,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
