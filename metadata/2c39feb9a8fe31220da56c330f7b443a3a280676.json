Banished to survive on her own, Priscilla has roamed the galaxy for ten years as an outcastÃ¢â‚¬â€to become a woman of extraordinary skill. . . .\n\nAn experienced officer assigned to the Liaden vessel Daxflan, she's been abandoned yet again. Betrayed by her captain and shipmates, she's left to fend for herself on a distant planet. But Priscilla is not alone. Starship captain Shan yos'Galen is about to join Priscilla's crusade for revenge. He has his own score to settle with the enemy. But confronting the sinister crew will be far easierÃ¢â‚¬â€and saferÃ¢â‚¬â€than confronting the demons of Priscilla's own mysterious past. \n\n\nNarrated by: Andy Caploe\nLength: 11 hrs and 59 mins \nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:09-04-12\nPublisher: Audible Studios","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c39feb9a8fe31220da56c330f7b443a3a280676","amp;dn":"Sharon+Lee%2C+Steve+Miller+-+Conflict+of+Honors+%28Liaden+%238%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c39feb9a8fe31220da56c330f7b443a3a280676","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,57,254,185,168,254,49,34,13,165,108,51,15,123,68,58,58,40,6,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
