CD's did not hit USA commercial shelves until 1981. So when a CD is dated earlier than 1980 or 1981 then something is not quite right. This CD was created in 1988 according to Discogs. Big Papi likes this album very much. Track 3 is amazing....drip drip drip drip drip....\n\n- Big Papi\n\nBy A Customer\n\nBack in 1979, three muscians who detested what was on the radio got together and formed a band that called themselves Easy Cure. Soon, the &quot;Easy&quot; was dropped and the rest is history. &quot; Boys Don't Cry &quot; was the first release from the legendary Cure. It's a good solid debut from Britain's greatest import. While I personally liked the three albums that followed better ( &quot;17 Seconds&quot; , &quot; Faith &quot;, and &quot; Pornography &quot;, respectively), this was a great album. Songwritting master- -mind Robert Smith cafted the beginning of a legacy with cuts like &quot; Killing an Arab &quot;, &quot; 10:15 on a Saturday Night &quot;, and &quot; Jumping on Someone Else's Train &quot; . The album has a dry, errie feeling on it rarely captured by a three piece band. Completlely disregarding all of the trends, Smith, Micheal Dempsey, and Lawerence &quot; Lol &quot; Tolhurst set the stage for gloom driven music to gain a degree of success. Smith sticks to simple, chorus laden rhythm guitar and tuneful basic leads, creating a melodic, and really original sound; and Dempsey has an inventive and busy bass groove going on underneath ( he was, however, replaced by the incomperable Simon Gallup an album later, and his style fits the Cure more comfortablely ). A masterstroke for sure, laying ground for even more compelling work in the years to follow.\n-- James Kaenan-Barbour\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nCure, The - Boys Don't Cry\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Cure, The\nAlbum................: Boys Don't Cry\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1980\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 259kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
