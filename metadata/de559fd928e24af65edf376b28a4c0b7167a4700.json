They are irreplaceable for the coloring of construction materials - their applications range from concrete to artist's colors, from industrial paints to toners in photocopiers, from coloring in foodstuffs to raw materials for catalysts. \r\n\r\nThis book offers everything there is to know about inorganic pigments in a concise and thorough presentation: their manufacturing processes, their applications and markets, their testing procedures and standards, and also the health and environmental regulations relating to them. The reader is provided with more than 800 up-to-date references to the pertinent literature, which will be extremely useful for further studies.\r\n\r\nOver 30 first-class authors from leading chemical companies have created a uniform and clearly structured text, giving an excellent overview of the subject area.\r\n\r\nThis book will be of benefit to all chemists, materials specialists, engineers, application technicians and students in pigment-related fields.\r\n\r\n'... the book under review is a class by itself...gives very useful information to the paint chemist regarding the basics and application aspects of the various pigments used in the chemical industry.'\r\n(Bulletin of Electrochemistry)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de559fd928e24af65edf376b28a4c0b7167a4700","amp;dn":"Industrial+Inorganic+Pigments+3rd+ed+-+G.+Buxbaum%2C+G.+Pfaff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de559fd928e24af65edf376b28a4c0b7167a4700","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,85,159,217,40,226,74,246,94,223,55,107,40,164,192,183,22,122,71,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
