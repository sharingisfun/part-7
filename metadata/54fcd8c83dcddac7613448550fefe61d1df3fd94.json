Only Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons were in the cast, and the female lead, Katie, was envisioned as &quot;a street-hardened, tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior&quot;.\n\nLorre bluntly admitted &quot;It sucked...but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was Johnny and Jim. We rewrote the thing entirely, and then we were blessed with Kaley and Simon and Kunal.&quot;\n\nFirst Kaley Cuoco does not appear!....the female lead is played by Andrea Walsh and was named &quot;Katie&quot;. She is met by Sheldon &amp; Leonard crying on a curb about her boyfriend and soon is asked to stay with them. The character of &quot;Katie&quot; is much more sexually looser than our beloved &quot;Penny&quot;. In fact in the pilot she totally exposes herself to the boys, of course her backside is covered by a towel to the camera! The characters of Howard &amp; Rajesh are not included and sorely needed. Basically it was originally a sort of geeky &quot;Three's Company&quot; with two guys and a girl living together. Sheldon also isn't as disliking of &quot;Katie&quot; as he is with Penny. The theme song used throughout is &quot;She Blinded Me With Science&quot;. Much of the dialogue and jokes from the pilot were re-used throughout episodes from the first season.\n\n\nEnjoy &amp; Seed After Downloading.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54fcd8c83dcddac7613448550fefe61d1df3fd94","amp;dn":"The+Big+Bang+Theory+%5B1x00%5D+Unaired+Pilot+-+x264+-+MKV+by+Riddler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54fcd8c83dcddac7613448550fefe61d1df3fd94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,252,216,200,61,205,218,199,97,52,72,85,15,239,230,29,29,243,253,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
