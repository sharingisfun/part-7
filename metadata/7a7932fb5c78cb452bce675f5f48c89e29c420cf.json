The title, originally derived from a stock screen term used by 1980s early computer video games to initiate a competitive encounter, was taken from English urban slang speech of the 1990s lad culture which the principal character Matthew Malone was an exemplar of. It was directed by John Stroud, produced by Sioned William and the BBC Television Head of Comedy Geoffrey Perkins, and executive produced by Denise O'Donohue on behalf of Hat Trick Productions for the BBC.\nAfter a successful first series, the option suffered somewhat from the loss its lead player Ben Chaplin, who quit the cast unexpectedly after receiving an offer of a film role in Hollywood on the back of his performance in Game On.\nThe first two series were written by Andrew Davies and Bernadette Davis. Davis wrote the final series alone.\nThe show's theme tune was &quot;Where I Find My Heaven&quot; by the Gigolo Aunts. The single reached number 29 in the UK singles chart in May 1995.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_On_(UK_TV_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_On_(UK_TV_series)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n[b])\nGame On - Series 01 (6X30 min)\nGame On - Series 02 (6X30 min)\nGame On - Series 03 (6X30 min)\n\n\n\n\n[/b]\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Game On.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 350 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 29mn 23s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 665 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 29mn 23s\nBitrate                     : 1 543 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.206\nStream size                 : 324 MB (93%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 29mn 23s\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 109 Kbps\nBitRate_Nominal/String      : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 22.9 MB (7%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 563 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a7932fb5c78cb452bce675f5f48c89e29c420cf","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Game+On+-+S01+to+03+-+Sitcom+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a7932fb5c78cb452bce675f5f48c89e29c420cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,121,50,251,92,120,203,69,43,206,103,95,95,72,200,158,41,196,32,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
