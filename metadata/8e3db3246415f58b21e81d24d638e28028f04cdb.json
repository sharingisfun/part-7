When he loses the lawsuit over securing his position as a professor and even his appeal is overruled without a just cause, he personally goes to the judge in charge and threatens him with a crossbow as he demands fair judgment. After a fierce struggle, Kim is arrested and the judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shirt with blood stain, a 2cm-long stab wound to judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s abdomen, and a broken arrow are presented as evidence. The story of the case spreads and the judiciary regulates Professor KimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behavior as a challenge towards constitutionalism and Ã¢â‚¬ËœterrorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The court reports that Kim will be punished severely for this incident. However, defendant Kim insists on his innocence, insisting that he had never shot an arrow, and this court case, which seemed as if it would conclude soon, experiences complications. There is no stepping back and testimonies do not match. Furthermore, the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbroken arrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the most important piece of evidence for this case is nowhere to be found. KimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uncompromising nature doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop him from criticizing the judge in the courtroom and his counsels give up defending him. But Ã¢â‚¬ËœuntamableÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ counsel Park Joon appears before Kim and the trial becomes active. Here begins a story of one man who stands against this senseless world with his belief in principles. ~ KOFIC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e3db3246415f58b21e81d24d638e28028f04cdb","amp;dn":"Unbowed+%282011%29+BluRay+1080p+5.1CH+x264+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e3db3246415f58b21e81d24d638e28028f04cdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,61,179,36,100,21,245,139,33,232,29,36,214,56,226,128,40,240,76,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
