Each illustration represents a design concept that can easily be recycled for use in new or modified mechanical, electromechanical, or mechatronic products. Tutorials on the basics of mechanisms and motion control systems introduce you to those subjects or act as a refresher.\n\nMechanisms and Mechanical Devices Sourcebook, Fifth Edition, contains new chapters on mechanisms for converting renewable energy into electrical power, 3D digital prototyping and simulation, and progress in MEMS and nanotechnology based on carbon nanotubes. A new chapter on stationary and mobile robots describes their roles in industry, science, national defense, and medicine. The latest advances in rapid prototyping are also discussed. This practical guide will get you up to speed on many classical mechanical devices as well as the hot new topics in mechanical engineering.\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE INDEX MAKES IT EASY TO FIND SUBJECTS OF INTEREST\n\nGLOSSARIES OF TERMS ON: CAMS, GEARS, MECHANICS, MOTION CONTROL, ROBOTICS, WIND ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6dd3939eb3e16d8623ef453e915aab9aa1c11a7","amp;dn":"Mechanisms+and+Mechanical+Devices+Sourcebook%2C+5th+Edition+%5BNon-F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6dd3939eb3e16d8623ef453e915aab9aa1c11a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,221,57,57,235,62,22,216,98,62,244,83,233,21,170,185,170,28,17,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
