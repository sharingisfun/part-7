Illuminating the connections running between the biography and fictions of Borges, Wilson traces the outline of this self-effacing literary figure. Though in his later writings Borges would subjugate emotion to the wild play of ideas, Jorge Luis Borges reminds us that he was always a poet whose life was recreated subtly in his work - but never in confessional ways - and restores his Argentine roots. It will be an invaluable resource for all those who treasure this modern master.\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;A balanced and fresh approach. . . Wilson's book opens with an inspired, panoramic essay on Borges's relationship with reading, biography and his own personality. . . Wilson shows a salutary impatience with critical clichÃƒÂ©s.&quot; -- Times Literary Supplement\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fd54109a7b899281188c47241f195ba9e9466f6","amp;dn":"Jason+Wilson+-+Biography+of+Jorge+Luis+Borges+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fd54109a7b899281188c47241f195ba9e9466f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,213,65,9,167,184,153,40,17,136,196,114,65,241,149,186,158,148,102,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
