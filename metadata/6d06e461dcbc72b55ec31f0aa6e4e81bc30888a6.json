Later, while en route to his future bride DoÃƒÂ±a Ximena (Sophia Loren), Don Rodrigo (Charlton Heston) becomes involved in a battle against a Moorish army. Two of the Emirs, Al-Mu'tamin (Douglas Wilmer) of Zaragosa and Al-Kadir (Frank Thring) of Valencia, are captured, but Rodrigo releases them on condition that they pledge to never again attack King Ferdinand of Castile's (Ralph Truman) lands. The Emirs proclaim him Ã¢â‚¬ËœEl CidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (the Castillian Spanish pronunciation of the Arabic for Lord: &quot;Al Sidi&quot;) and swear allegiance to him.\n\nFor this act he is accused of treason against the King by Count OrdÃƒÂ³ÃƒÂ±ez (Raf Vallone) and later Ximena's father, Count Gormaz (Andrew Cruickshank). Rodrigo's proud father, Don Diego (Michael Hordern), supports Rodrigo against Count OrdÃƒÂ³ÃƒÂ±ez. Later Gormaz refuses to take back the challenge or the accusation of treason, and Rodrigo kills him, the King's Champion, in a duel. Ximena swears revenge upon her unrepentant father's murderer. Rodrigo then takes up the mantle of the King's champion in single combat for control of the city of Calahorra, which he wins. Rodrigo is then sent upon a mission to collect tribute from Moorish vassals of the Castillian crown, but Ximena, in league with Count OrdÃƒÂ³ÃƒÂ±ez, has plotted to have Rodrigo killed. El Cid and his men are ambushed but are saved by Al-Mu'tamin, to whom he had previously showed clemency. Returning home, his reward is the hand of Ximena in marriage. But the marriage is not consummated, she removes herself to a convent.\n\nKing Ferdinand dies, and his eldest son, Prince Sancho (Gary Raymond), becomes king. The younger son, Prince Alfonso (John Fraser), also desires the throne; his sister, Princess Urraca (GeneviÃƒÂ¨ve Page) secretly has Sancho assassinated. At Alfonso's coronation, El Cid has him swear upon the Bible that he had no part in the death of his brother. Since he had no part in it as his sister was responsible, he swears so, but has Rodrigo banished for his impudence. Ximena's love for El Cid is rekindled, she chooses banishment with him and they have children.\n\nBut Rodrigo is called into service by other exiled Spanish fighters, and eventually into the service of the king once again, to protect Castille from Yusuf's North African army. Rodrigo does not join the king, and allies himself with the Emirs who fight at Valencia, where Rodrigo relieves the city of the wicked Emir Al-Kadir, who betrayed him. Count OrdÃƒÂ³ÃƒÂ±ez brings Ximena from where the king had imprisoned her and the children after his defeat by the Moors. Valencia falls and Emir Al-Mu'tamin, Rodrigo's army and the Valencians offer the crown to Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe CidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, but he refuses and sends the crown to King Alfonso. Rodrigo then repels the invading army of Ben Yusuf, but is wounded in battle by an arrow before the final victory. If the arrow is removed, there is a chance that he will live, but he will not be able to lead his army. El Cid obtains a promise from Ximena to not remove it, knowing that this will kill him. He intends to ride out, even if dead. King Alfonso comes to his bedside and asks for his forgiveness.\n\nThe morning after El Cid dies, his body is secured upon his horse and sent out at the head of his army with King Alfonso and Emir Al-Mu'tamin on either side of his horse. When Yusuf's army see him with his eyes still open, they believe that El Cid's ghost has come back from the dead. Babieca, his horse, tramples on and kills Ben Yusuf, who is too terrified to fight. The invading North African army is completely defeated. King Alfonso leads Christians and Moors in a prayer &quot;for the purest knight of all&quot;.\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES:-\nLoren was paid $200,000 for ten weeks' work; producer Samuel Bronston also agreed to pay $200 a week for her hairdresser.\nRamÃƒÂ³n MenÃƒÂ©ndez Pidal, a Spanish authority on El Cid and Spain in the Middle Ages was the &quot;historical adviser for the film and the &quot;overall interpretation of the hero as presented by Charlton Heston.&quot;[3]\n\nTime magazine provided some production details: &quot;Inevitably, the picture is colossalÃ¢â‚¬â€it runs three hours and 15 minutes (including intermission), cost $6,200,000, employs an extra-wide widescreen, a special color process, 7,000 extras, 10,000 costumes, 35 ships, 50 outsize engines of medieval war, and four of the noblest old castles in Spain: Ampudia, Belmonte, PeÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ­scola and TorrelobatÃƒÂ³n.&quot;\n\nAmpudia appears as the raided village at the beginning of the film, TorrelobatÃƒÂ³n as Cid's hometown Vivar, the Castle of Belmonte appears as Calahorra, and PeÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ­scola and Bamburgh Castle as Valencia.\n\nThe film was shot mostly on location in Spain but a few studio scenes were shot in Rome, purely to achieve the financial gains of co-production status. An Iberia airplane is allegedly seen in the background during the Valencia battle scenes.\n\nThe movie earned $12 million in North American rentals.\n\nUpon the film's release, Bosley Crowther wrote &quot;it is hard to remember a pictureÃ¢â‚¬â€not excluding Henry V, Ivanhoe, Helen of Troy and, naturally, Ben-HurÃ¢â‚¬â€in which scenery and regal rites and warfare have been so magnificently assembled and photographed as they are in this dazzler...The pure graphic structure of the pictures, the imposing arrangement of the scenes, the dynamic flow of the action against strong backgrounds, all photographed with the 70-mm. color camera and projected on the Super-Technirama screen, give a grandeur and eloquence to this production that are worth seeing for themselves.&quot; Crowther also pointed out that while &quot;the spectacle is terrific[,] the human drama is stiff and dull.&quot;\n\nThe film's leading lady had a major issue with Bronston's promotion of the film, an issue important enough to her that Loren sued Bronston for breach of contract in New York Supreme Court. As Time described it:\n\n    On a 600-sq.-ft. billboard facing south over Manhattan's Times Square, Sophia Loren's name appears in illuminated letters that could be read from an incoming liner, butÃ¢â‚¬â€Mamma mia!Ã¢â‚¬â€that name is below Charlton Heston's. In the language of the complaint: &quot;If the defendants are permitted to place deponent's name below that of Charlton Heston, then it will appear that deponent's status is considered to be inferior to that of Charlton Heston ... It is impossible to determine or even to estimate the extent of the damages which the plaintiff will suffer.&quot;\n\nThe film is a favorite of Martin Scorsese, who called it &quot;one of the greatest epic films ever made.&quot; Scorsese was one of the major forces behind a 1993 restoration and re-release of El Cid.\nAwards and nominations\n\nEl Cid was nominated for three Academy Awards, for Best Art Direction (Veniero Colasanti, John Moore), Original Music Score for MiklÃƒÂ³s RÃƒÂ³zsa and Best Song.\nIt was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Director, Anthony Mann and Samuel Bronston won the 1962 Special Merit Award.\nRobert Krasker won the 1961 Best Cinematography Award by the British Society of Cinematographers. Verna Fields won the 1962 &quot;Golden Reel Award&quot; of the Motion Picture Sound Editors.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1589 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 2.353:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 448kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  6\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 66 mins\nSubtitles: English, Spanish\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d06e461dcbc72b55ec31f0aa6e4e81bc30888a6","amp;dn":"El+Cid+%281961%29+Disk+2+-Xvid+2cd+-+Subs-Eng-Sp-+Charlton+Heston%2C+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d06e461dcbc72b55ec31f0aa6e4e81bc30888a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,6,228,97,220,188,114,181,94,195,31,10,166,228,232,27,195,8,136,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
