It was their first studio release since the return of longtime lead singer Bruce Dickinson (who left in 1993) and guitarist Adrian Smith (who left in 1990) in 1999, as well as the band's first studio recording with their current three guitar line-up, as Janick Gers remained with the band.\n\nThe album art and title song are references to the novel of the same name, written by Aldous Huxley. The upper half of the artwork was created by Derek Riggs, with the bottom half by digital artist Steve Stone.\n\nThe songs &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; and &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; were both released as singles. &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;'s promotional radio release featured extra vocals in the chorus, not present in any other versions of the song.\n\nThe Brave New World Tour was the tour in support of the album, during which the show at Rock in Rio was recorded and later released as a live album and video.\n\nBrave New World peaked at No. 7 in the UK Albums Chart, and has since been certified Gold. In the United States, it debuted at No. 39 on the Billboard 200, and registered over 307,000 sales on the Nielsen SoundScan system in 2008.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;The Wicker Man&quot;   \t\t        4:35\n2. \t&quot;Ghost of the Navigator&quot;   \t        6:50\n3. \t&quot;Brave New World&quot;   \t \t        6:18\n4. \t&quot;Blood Brothers&quot;   \t                7:14\n5. \t&quot;The Mercenary&quot;   \t\t        4:42\n6. \t&quot;Dream of Mirrors&quot;    \t                9:21\n7. \t&quot;The Fallen Angel&quot;   \t\t        4:00\n8. \t&quot;The Nomad&quot;    \t                        9:06\n9. \t&quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;   \t \t6:25\n10. \t&quot;The Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot;  \t8:26\n\nTotal length:                                   1:06:57\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d9a4353142dd7a195a7b1b60603f25c18c50da4","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+%282000%29+Brave+New+World+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d9a4353142dd7a195a7b1b60603f25c18c50da4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,154,67,83,20,45,215,161,149,167,177,182,6,3,242,92,24,197,13,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
