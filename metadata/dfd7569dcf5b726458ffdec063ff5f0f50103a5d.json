Chloe (Adele Haenel) is 13, and has been profoundly damaged from a life of abandonment -- so much so that she refuses to be to be physically touched, and never speaks. Her brother, Joseph (Vincent Rottiers), despite being slightly younger, has taken a fiercely protective stance with his sister. \nStreet-smart and wiser than his years, Joseph hopes that they'll eventually find a family who will take them both in. Though their situation forces them to steal, the authorities catch them and leave the two siblings inside of a home for disturbed youth. At first, Joseph tries to escape, but puts his plans on hold when it looks as if a doctor is making progress with Chloe. Eventually, however, fights with the other orphans and a shocking piece of news force the children to go on the run once more.\n\n.....................................................\n\n\nFor some screenshots see  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=6&amp;action=display&amp;thread=4420&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=6&amp;action=display&amp;thread=4420&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n.....................................................\n\n\nCast:\n\tAdele Haenel\t \t... \tChloÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©\n\tVincent Rottiers\t... \tJoseph\n\tRochdy Labidi\t\t... \tKarim\n\tJacques BonnaffÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©\t... \tDoran\n\tAurÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lia Petit\t\t... \tLa mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re de Joseph\n\tGalamelah Lagra\t\t... \tDjamel (as Galamelah Lagraa)\n\tDominique Reymond\t... \tLa directrice\n\t\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
