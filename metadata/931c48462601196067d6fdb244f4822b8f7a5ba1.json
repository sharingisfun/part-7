The good doctor's theories revolve around keeping brains stimulated by performing various mental activities.\n\nWhen players begin a new game, they must participate in a selection of tests that will determine their brain age within the game. This number is called the 'brain age'. As the player uses the software over a series of weeks and months, their ability to perform the exercises will improve and their brain age will (hopefully) decrease. All progress is charted in graph form and sharing a game gives players the option to compare their results with those of family and friends. Progress can also be shared on the official website at www.brainexercise.eu for worldwide ranking.\n\nBrain Exercise with Dr. Kawashima is a series of quick mini exercises divided into three colour-coded categories designed to give your brain a workout, and to train the three main lobes of the brain - frontal, parietal and temporal - through simple arithmetic, memory games and puzzles. The highly intuitive games are played using the mouse to point and click or simple keystrokes.\n\n.:Screenshots:.\n Visit this link: http://img527.Imageshack.us/img527/7752/00medium348340497690b51.jpg  Visit this link: http://img46.Imageshack.us/img46/3898/medium34825885691fb5408.jpg  Visit this link: http://img686.Imageshack.us/img686/4923/medium34825888037468102.jpg  Visit this link: http://img686.Imageshack.us/img686/8439/medium348340573697c040f.jpg\n\n.:Tech Sheet:.\n\nS.O.: MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP Service Pack 1, XP Service Pack 2 Vista (Operating System must be up to date with the latest fixes)\nDimension: 806.187.008.\nLanguage: Inglese, Italiano\nGenere: Puzzle \nDevelopper: Namco Bandai\nOfficiale Site:  Visit this link: http://www.stimulation-cerebrale.com/it\n\n\nRequierement:\nProcessor:   Intel Pentium III 1GHz or equivalent\nRAM:    512 MB RAM for MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP / 2GB for MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Vista\nVideo:    ATI Radeon 9000 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4200\nFree HD Space:  100 MB available hard drive space\nSound:   DirectX 9.0c compliant soundcard, plus speakers or headphones ;\n\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:931c48462601196067d6fdb244f4822b8f7a5ba1","amp;dn":"%5BPuzzle+-+1DVD+-+Multi2%5D+Brain+Exercise+With+Dr+Kawashima+%5BTntvi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"931c48462601196067d6fdb244f4822b8f7a5ba1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,28,72,70,38,1,25,96,103,214,253,178,68,244,130,43,143,122,91,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
