The best film of the 90&amp;#039;s., 6 September 2000\n10/10\nAuthor: Thomas Peluso (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d3a7a3b6bfa6a0bc93b4beb2babffdb0bcbe&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;) from Long Island, NY\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it&amp;#039;s almost scary.\n\nTim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy&amp;#039;s relationship with &quot;Red&quot; Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy&amp;#039;s who suffers under the iron will of Norton.\n\nIf you haven&amp;#039;t seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the &amp;#039;90&amp;#039;s, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10 \n\nCast (Cast overview, first billed only)\n\tTim Robbins\t... \tAndy Dufresne\n\tMorgan Freeman\t... \tEllis Boyd &amp;#039;Red&amp;#039; Redding\n\tBob Gunton\t... \tWarden Norton\n\tWilliam Sadler\t... \tHeywood\n\tClancy Brown\t... \tCaptain Hadley\n\tGil Bellows\t... \tTommy\n\tMark Rolston\t... \tBogs Diamon\n\nIMDb &gt; The Shawshank Redemption (1994) User Rating: 9.2/10                     Release Date:23 September 1994 (USA) \nTop 250: #2\n\nGeneral           : The Shawshank RedemptionThe Shawshank Redemption.avi\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 707 MiB for 2h 19mn 6ms\n\nVideo #0          : DivX 3 Low at 580 Kbps\nAspect            : 512 x 272 (1.882) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3 at 112 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48 KHz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b303e75d013fe68c326f1436fdb049edd344e45","amp;dn":"The+Shawshank+Redemption+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b303e75d013fe68c326f1436fdb049edd344e45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,48,62,117,208,19,254,104,195,38,241,67,111,219,4,158,221,52,78,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
