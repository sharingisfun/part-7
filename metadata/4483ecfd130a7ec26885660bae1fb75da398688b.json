This album was released on August 23, 1988 (see 1988 in music). &quot;Jane Says&quot; and &quot;Pigs in Zen&quot; had previously appeared on the band&amp;#039;s earlier live album, in 1987. The album title is a line from the song &quot;Ted, Just Admit It...&quot;.\n\n&quot;Pigs in Zen&quot; was initially included as a CD bonus track only; it was not included on the early vinyl and cassette versions.\n\nThis album was nominated for the 1989 Grammy Awards; the same year Jane&amp;#039;s Addiction took a break.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 309 on Rolling Stone magazine&amp;#039;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It is also number 19 on their list of 100 greatest album covers.\n\nThe song &quot;Ted, Just Admit It...&quot; is about serial killer Ted Bundy and contains spoken words by Bundy, from a statement he made.\n\nThe song &quot;Jane Says&quot; is about a real person, Jane Bainter. Bainter was addicted to heroin and was always &quot;going to kick tomorrow&quot;. She did have a boyfriend named Sergio. She was a &quot;white collar&quot; junkie?she did not steal and was not a prostitute. She did, in fact, eventually kick the habit.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1. &quot;Up the Beach&quot; (Farrell) - 3:00\n2. &quot;Ocean Size&quot; (Avery/Farrell/Navarro/Perkins) - 4:20\n3. &quot;Had a Dad&quot; (Farrell) - 3:44\n4. &quot;Ted, Just Admit It...&quot; (Farrell/Navarro/Perkins) - 7:23\n5. &quot;Standing in the Shower...
