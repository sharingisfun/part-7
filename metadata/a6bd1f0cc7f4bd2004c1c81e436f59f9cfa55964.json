Also, I don't know if this was cropped from 4:3 after the fact or if it's some sort of post-post-modern irony, but half of the director's credit is out of frame. Either way, it doesn't detract from the SHOCK AND TERROR.\n\nEnjoy and donate:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6bd1f0cc7f4bd2004c1c81e436f59f9cfa55964","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+Birdemic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6bd1f0cc7f4bd2004c1c81e436f59f9cfa55964","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,189,31,12,199,244,189,32,4,193,200,30,67,111,89,249,207,165,89,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
