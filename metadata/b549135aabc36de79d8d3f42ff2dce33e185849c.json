This MASCHINE Expansion shares the spirit of creative beatmakers who use their deep knowledge of hip-hop production to break the rules. Forget dusty clichÃƒÂ©s, and aim high with a new future aesthetic.\n\nThe kits, synths and patterns in TRUE SCHOOL combine inspired sampling, hi-tech sound design and creative drum programming to lay new foundations for the future of beatmaking.\n\nAcoustic and electronic drums are enhanced with artifacts and sonic embellishments, with the organic room sound intact. These drums have a bold signature: sharp, warm and gritty at the same time.\n\nStrings, brass and pianos (both modern and vintage) have been re-sampled, filtered and processed for a harder attack and a vibrant tone.\n\nHard-to-find vintage and modern synthesizers, including the Arp Quadra, Rhodes Chroma, and Moog Minimoog Model D, were recorded through a Trident analog console and processed for an up-front sound to fit right into the mix. Basses and leads from Studio Electronics SE-1 and ATC-1 synths were recorded through a Steven Slate Fox preamp.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (04).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b549135aabc36de79d8d3f42ff2dce33e185849c","amp;dn":"Maschine+Packs+-+True+School+-+OS+X+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b549135aabc36de79d8d3f42ff2dce33e185849c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,73,19,90,171,195,109,231,157,141,63,66,255,45,206,51,225,133,132,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
