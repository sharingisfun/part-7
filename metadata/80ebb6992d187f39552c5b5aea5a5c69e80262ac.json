Loopy Lope de Aguirre and his conquistadors sail themselves up a creek without gold or paddle, decimated by unseen assailants, hostile environs, exhausted provisions, and mad, merciless self-slaughter. Aguirre (the excellent Antonutti) is a tired 50-year-old way down the military pecking order; if voice-overs suggest he sees himself as God's instrument, Saura portrays his murderous deeds asa product of the clashing forces of Spanish society. His attempt to demythologise this folie de grandeur within the conventions of the big budget epic (at $9 million, Spain's most expensive film to date) excels in evoking the destructive effects of sexual jealousy, envy, greed and the Spanish obsession with death. But despite lush 'Scope photography and the meticulous display of authentic armour and finery, the film is often oppressive, and too dependent on faces to communicate meaning, adding obscurity to something already complex and ambiguous. Not Saura's best, perhaps, but a fascinating attempt to get to the heart of myths, men and history.\n\n[img]http://img527.imageshack.us/img527/8636/vlcsnap9217re4.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img70.imageshack.us/img70/6334/vlcsnap11994rw4.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/2884/vlcsnap12373fb5.png[/img]\n\n--------not my rip----\n\n~~~~~~ El Dorado.avi ~~~~~~   \n\nunpacked bitstream                                  \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,476,103,682                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.1.2 Final              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................2:22:44                \nFrame Count:....................................214078             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................272                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................2.353                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1213                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP..................N-VOP......                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.279&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................153                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2     \n\n       *****************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
