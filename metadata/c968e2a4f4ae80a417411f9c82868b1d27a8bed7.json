The volume is divided into two main parts: processes and materials. The processing section has 18 chapters, each explaining a different joining technique.\nThe materials section has joining information for 25 generic polymer families. Both sections contain data organized according to the joining methods used for that material. * A significant and extensive update from experts at The Welding Institute* A systematic approach to discussing each joining method including: process, advantages and disadvantages, applications, materials, equipment, joint design, and welding parameters* Includes international suppliers' directory and glossary of key joining terms* Includes new techniques such as flash free welding and friction stir welding* Covers thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers, and rubbers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c968e2a4f4ae80a417411f9c82868b1d27a8bed7","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Plastics+Joining%3A+A+Practical+Guide%2C+Second+Ed.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c968e2a4f4ae80a417411f9c82868b1d27a8bed7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,104,226,164,244,174,128,164,23,65,31,156,130,134,139,29,39,168,190,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
