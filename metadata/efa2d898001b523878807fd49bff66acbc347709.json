This is the latest version with the 1.44 update.\nChange Notes and game info below\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/unepic&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/unepic&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhile taking a break from playing a tabletop RPG, Daniel, an average guy from modern times, is transported to HarnakonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Castle. Thinking that he is suffering from a hallucination, he decides that he is going to run the adventure for as long as the illusion lasts. As he explores the castle, fights the monsters within, and even casts potent magical spells, Daniel comes to realize that not everything is as it seems.\n\nUnepic heroically combines open-world platforming gameplay with the intricacy and challenge of the RPG. Tweak DanielÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skills to your heartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s content. Fight a bewildering variety of monsters, from the lowly goblin to the gigantic dragon, with over 100 different weapons. If forbidden magics are more your calling, then 70 spells and magical items will please even the most discriminating would-be wizard. Monsters, weapons, potions, spells, quests, pets, bosses, a giant castle all come together to make a funny story Unepic. If you love nerd-based humor and the RPG munchkin in you is strong, you'll appreciate every last bit of this charming RPG/platformer!\n\n\nChange Notes\n\n- new: English voices (single player) are now available. \n- new: Zoom available (key Z as default) \n- new: Sort your inventory/spells/recipes (press K when on them) \n- changed: spear traps now deals a percentage of HP, no more 1hp \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efa2d898001b523878807fd49bff66acbc347709","amp;dn":"Unepic+%28GOG%29+%28Latest+Version+With+1.44+Update%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efa2d898001b523878807fd49bff66acbc347709","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,162,216,152,0,27,82,56,120,128,127,212,155,255,102,172,188,52,119,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
