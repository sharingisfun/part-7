Each drawing has a descriptive paragraph -sometimes longer. The figures depict different ages from infants &amp; toddlers to young teens, boys and girls. A center color section repeats a representative selection of the line drawings in full color. Also useful is the inclusion of drawings of period infant furniture &amp; children's playthings and accessories. While there is no index and no patterns in this work it does give a good overview of children's wear that is not often included in other books. It would be very useful for theatre costumers and families into period reenactment or hobby costuming","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52f0c8876929afc9fd4f8f2090dc63f9c336502c","amp;dn":"Childrens+Costume+in+America%2C+1607-1910+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52f0c8876929afc9fd4f8f2090dc63f9c336502c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,240,200,135,105,41,175,201,253,79,143,32,144,220,99,249,195,54,80,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
