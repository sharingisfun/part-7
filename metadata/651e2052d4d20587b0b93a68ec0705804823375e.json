I want what you have, I want what you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have, I want more of what I already have. I want. But if you so much as ask for something in return, go ahead and walk away. Know if you want to play in my world, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s every man for themselves and the weak become mine. Leeches will be obliterated because I make it my job to destroy them. I protect whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mine and I take whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s yoursÃ¢â‚¬Â¦because thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what I do. I want.\nMy story will not endear me to you and, frankly, I could care less if it does because IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m in this for the money and nothing else. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing redeeming about me. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a corrupt, money hungry, immoral asshole from Los Angeles. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m every manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worst nightmare and every girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fantasy.\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Spencer BlackwellÃ¢â‚¬Â¦And this is the story about how I went from the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most coveted guy to the guy no one wanted around and why I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trade it for anything in the world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:651e2052d4d20587b0b93a68ec0705804823375e","amp;dn":"GREED+-Fisher+Amelie.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"651e2052d4d20587b0b93a68ec0705804823375e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,30,32,82,212,210,5,135,176,185,58,104,236,7,5,128,72,35,55,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
