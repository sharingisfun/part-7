She is initially rejected from the community, and is gossiped about constantly. However the students she teaches fall in love with her style. One of her tasks is to teach the children to sing. However, instead of teaching school songs or patriotic songs, she teaches them folk songs. Misfortune strikes and she is forced to leave the school, but not before she makes a lasting impression on the children. They will see her again, as a teacher, but not for another five years.\n\nFrom these humble beginnings a rich story about the poor in Japan before, during, and after World War 2 is shown. We get to know all twelve children (&quot;24 eyes&quot;) in the movie, and eventually learn about their fates as adults. We see the equivalent of the &quot;Red Scare&quot; in Japan, and the saddening events caused by World War 2. Although overdramatic, the feelings still feel genuine and even the hardest of people will not be able to resist shedding a tear or two over the fates of the children you grow to love.\n\nI can only ask you to watch the full 3 hours. That is the only way one can truly appreciate the beauty of this film. There is nothing else to be said. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â \n\nMy rip from DVD, courtesy of the university library. \n\nDIVX avi file.
