The middle feast highlights the Church, in more ways than is generally recognized.\n\nThis briefing reveals the rich background of these feasts with many surprises for the Biblical believer, and yet only scratches the surface. The first half of this briefing pack is taught by Chuck Missler with the later half taught by Dan Stolebarger.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nCharles W. Missler graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy before working for several years in the aerospace and computer industries. He joined the Ford Motor Company in 1963. Missler joined Western Digital as chairman and chief executive in June 1977, and became the largest shareholder of Western Digital. In a 1984 interview, Western Digital's then chairman, Roger Johnson described the company under Missler as having a good reputation for technology with a terrible reputation for execution, and seriously undercapitalized.\n\nIn 1983 Missler became the chairman and chief executive of Helionetics Inc., another technology company. He left Heliotronics in 1984 &quot;to pursue other opportunities in the high-technology field.&quot; In August 1985 Helionetics sued former chairman Missler, alleging a conflict of interest. Missler and other Helionetics executives had decided not to purchase a small defense electronics maker, which company was subsequently purchased by an investment corporation in which Missler held a controlling interest. The suit was settled when Missler's firm agreed to pay Helionetics $1.6 million.\n\nIn 1989 he headed up the Phoenix Group International, a former Colorado real estate company that entered the high-tech industry to sell personal computers to Russian schools. Phoenix filed for bankruptcy protection in 1990 when the deal did not develop as anticipated.\n\nAfter teaching for many years at Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa, Missler moved to Coeur d'Alene in 1992 and founded Koinonia House. Chuck Missler is an author, evangelical Christian, Bible teacher, engineer, and former businessman. He is the founder of the Koinonia House ministry based in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a5115bbd8d75ffd52a9e3f181bfa3ad3b1fdc30","amp;dn":"The+Feasts+Of+Israel+-+Chuck+Missler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a5115bbd8d75ffd52a9e3f181bfa3ad3b1fdc30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,81,21,187,216,215,95,253,82,169,227,241,129,191,163,173,59,31,220,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
