Steve Lillywhite produced Away from the World, which marks his first released studio album with the band since 1998's Before These Crowded Streets. A series of failed sessions with Lillywhite led to the leaked Lillywhite Sessions in 2000 and Lillywhite's departure from the band's work.\n\nDMB and Lillywhite recorded the album in a Seattle studio beginning in early January 2012,[7] and production on the album finished in May.[8] In addition to the 11 songs that made the album, one other song was attempted during the sessions, but the band did not complete that song.[9] Violinist Boyd Tinsley said of the process: &quot;Some of the songs that you hear on this album, the basic tracks came out, like, the first or second time we played them. Dave would come in with part of a song. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d get into the control room and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d finish it, putting in a chorus or bridge here and working out arrangements. And then we went to the studio, and we just played.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n\n    &quot;Broken Things&quot; (Matthews, John Alagia) - 3:48\n    &quot;Belly Belly Nice&quot; (Matthews, Rashawn Ross) - 3:53\n    &quot;Mercy&quot; - 4:28\n    &quot;Gaucho&quot; (Stefan Lessard, Matthews, Tim Reynolds, Ross) - 4:25\n    &quot;Sweet&quot; - 4:12\n    &quot;The Riff&quot; (Matthews, Ross) - 5:35\n    &quot;Belly Full&quot; (Matthews, John Alagia) - 1:43\n    &quot;If Only&quot; - 5:38\n    &quot;Rooftop&quot; - 4:12\n    &quot;Snow Outside&quot; (Beauford, Lessard, Tinsley, Coffin, Reynolds, Ross) - 6:11\n    &quot;Drunken Soldier&quot; (Beauford, Lessard,Tinsley, Coffin, Reynolds, Ross) - 9:45\n\nDeluxe Version \n\n    Gaucho (Hartford, CT Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5.25.12)\n    Mercy (Bristow, VA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6.16.12)\n    Sweet (Cleveland, OH Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6.3.12)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDave Matthews Band\n\n    Carter Beauford Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, vocals\n    Stefan Lessard Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n    Dave Matthews Ã¢â‚¬â€œ acoustic, electric guitars, ukulele, and piano, lead vocals\n    Jeff Coffin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ saxophone\n    Boyd Tinsley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ electric violin, violin\n    Tim Reynolds - electric guitar\n    Rashawn Ross Ã¢â‚¬â€œ trumpet, vocals\n\nGuest\n\n    Roger Smith - Hammond Organ\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7267d4162a1a8a1be2460f9b3bf2f821f1e379c0","amp;dn":"Dave+Matthews+-+Away+From+The+World+%5BDELUXE%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7267d4162a1a8a1be2460f9b3bf2f821f1e379c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,103,212,22,42,26,138,27,226,70,15,155,59,242,248,33,241,227,121,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
