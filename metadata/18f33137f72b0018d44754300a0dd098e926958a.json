The painstaking algebra on some chapters simply forced me in uploading the solutions manual. Algebra should be done using maple or some other computing program...but I digress. \n\nThis does have all of the chapters (1-18) including 2-port systems..which I noticed some torrents do not have.\n\nInformation should be free, so please, keep uploading E-books! \n\nThis is me giving back to a great community.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18f33137f72b0018d44754300a0dd098e926958a","amp;dn":"Electric+Circuits+%288th+Edition%29%3A+Nilsson+%5BSolution+Manual%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18f33137f72b0018d44754300a0dd098e926958a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,243,49,55,247,43,0,24,212,71,84,48,10,13,208,152,233,38,149,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
