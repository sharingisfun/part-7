One of the greatest secrets to a dancer's body is ballet conditioning which focuses on all muscle groups. In this unique program your muscles will work smoothly in unison to create a long streamlined silhouette with flat abs a lean lower body and beautifully defined curves. Moving gracefully and fluidly through this series of exercises you will strengthen and stretch your way to a dancers body. Elise Gulan has over 18 years in dance education including Ballet Pointe Tap and Jazz. She was a principal soloist for the Virginia Ballet Company where she danced for seven years appearing in productions such as Copelia Swan Lake and Nutcracker Suite. She brought her love of expression through movement to her new career as a certified personal trainer and instructor of Yoga Core FusionÃ‚Â® and Core Energy FlowÃ‚Â®. Elise enjoys helping her students to find their inner strength and to energize their joy of life through physical and mental fitness.\n\nAn intense lower-body workout that incorporates a variety of ballet-inspired movements. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s designed to give you the long, lean body of a dancer by working deep into every muscle. Elise GulanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one-on-one, voiceover cuing makes it easy to follow. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s both ballet-authentic and non-intimidating (e.g. Ã¢â‚¬Å“weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do a series of battements; thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s French for big kicksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½). The exercises incorporate familiar classics: pliÃƒÂ©s and tÃÂµndues, port de bras and rond de jambes. But, each sequence also includes lots of subtle variations Ã¢â‚¬â€ tempo changes, movement progressions, pulses and holds. The short cardio segment is an intense series of fast-moving kicks, jumps and Ã¢â‚¬Å“plyo-pliÃƒÂ©s.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Beautiful outdoor garden setting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf9fa5f903ff39d574306742017a340f2182d4dd","amp;dn":"Elise+Gulan+-+Ballet+Conditioning+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf9fa5f903ff39d574306742017a340f2182d4dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,159,165,249,3,255,57,213,116,48,103,66,1,122,52,15,33,130,212,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
