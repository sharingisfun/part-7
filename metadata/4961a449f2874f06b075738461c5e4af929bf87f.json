Set in the fictional town of Union Grove, New York, the novel follows a cast of characters as they navigate a world stripped of its modern comforts, ravaged by terrorism, epidemics, and the economic upheaval of peak oil.[1]\n\nNarrated by Robert Earle, a local carpenter who has lost his wife and son, the novel focuses on several contrasting groups meant to represent the directions society could go after a breakdown of modern social norms. In the beginning of the novel, the citizens of Union Grove are living on the tail end of a national catastrophe, with their community slowly falling apart from neglect and natural decay. One group is led by Wayne Karp, a rough leader of scrappers and thugs who salvage from around the county and live in a group of trailers known as Karpsville. As the story begins Brother Jobe comes to town, the leader of a religious group called the New Faith Church, who come from the south and settle into the old high school. Another faction is led by Steven Bulloch, a landed farmer with vision who sets his farm up like an English manor and becomes self-sufficient. Much of the rest of the nation seems to be falling apart, with nuclear blasts in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., cities devolving and a fractured United States. All of these forces struggle to respect life in a way that was taken for granted before events changed, and build pragmatically for a new future. Earle's experiences are the focus of this struggle.\n\nKunstler explores themes of local and sustainable living. In interviews, Kunstler describes his imaginary world as an &quot;enlightened nineteenth century.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/World-Made-James-Howard-Kunstler/dp/0871139782&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/World-Made-James-Howard-Kunstler/dp/0871139782&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.worldmadebyhand.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.worldmadebyhand.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormats: mobi, epub, pdf\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4961a449f2874f06b075738461c5e4af929bf87f","amp;dn":"James+Howard+Kunster+-+World+Made+By+Hand+%282008%29+MOBI+EPUB+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4961a449f2874f06b075738461c5e4af929bf87f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,97,164,73,242,135,79,6,176,117,115,132,97,197,228,175,146,155,248,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
