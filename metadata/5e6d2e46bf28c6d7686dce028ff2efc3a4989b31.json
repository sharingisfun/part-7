Throughout their career, the band has sold over five million albums worldwide,[1] won four Juno Awards, and won ten MuchMusic Video AwardsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the most MMVAs ever awarded to any artist or group.[2]\n\nOLP has released six studio albums, one live album, and one compilation album, with their 1997 album Clumsy often being considered their best and most recognized work to date.[3] They have enjoyed many hit singles, ranging from &quot;Starseed&quot; in 1994, to &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; in 2002.\n\nThe band's fifth and sixth studio albums, Gravity and Healthy in Paranoid Times, are widely believed to have been a &quot;radical departure&quot;[4] from the generally consistent style of music insinuated by the band's first four studio albums. Various reasons are accredited to the style change, particularly the 2001 departure of founding band member Mike Turner and the subsequent collaboration with producer Bob Rock.[5]\n\nOur Lady Peace's seventh studio release, titled Burn Burn, is currently in production,[6] and is nearing completion. No official release date has yet been confirmed, but band members have suggested early 2009 as a likely timeframe for release. The album will be OLP's first new release since 2005, the longest gap between any two OLP studio albums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaveed 1994\n\n\nNaveed is the first album by Canadian rock band Our Lady Peace. It was produced by Arnold Lanni. The album was released on March 22, 1994 by Sony Records. Naveed became a success in Canada, selling over 100,000 copies (Platinum Certification) by the end of the year.[citation needed] The album is also the longest in the line of the band's studio albums, being two minutes longer than the average length of 45:00. There were five singles released for the album. The first single, &quot;The Birdman,&quot; introduced the band. The second and third singles &quot;Starseed&quot; and &quot;Naveed,&quot; respectively, became smash hits in Canada. They both became prominent components in the band's live performances. &quot;Naveed&quot; would always be the opening song, and the setlist would end with &quot;Starseed.&quot;\n\nNaveed is considered one of the band's most raw and edgy works to date. The main highlight of the band was vocalist Raine Maida's extreme falsetto, and how he could travel between high and low octaves with varying intensities with ease. These vocals provided an overall condensed melody to subside with the heavy instruments.\n\nThey exchanged this sound for a more mainstream sound in 2002 with the release of Gravity and in 2005 with Healthy in Paranoid Times. The tone of the album is darker and about more controversial topics than later releases.\n\nIt has been recently noted by band frontman Raine Maida that Our Lady Peace's upcoming seventh studio album Burn Burn, will feature music more similar to that of Naveed than that of recent albums, though &quot;a little mature&quot;.[1]\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Birdman&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15 \n2.\t&quot;Supersatellite&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44 \n3.\t&quot;Starseed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07 \n4.\t&quot;Hope&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15 \n5.\t&quot;Naveed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:51 \n6.\t&quot;Dirty Walls&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46 \n7.\t&quot;Denied&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00 \n8.\t&quot;Is It Safe?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48 \n9.\t&quot;Julia&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59 \n10.\t&quot;Under Zenith&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45 \n11.\t&quot;Neon Crossing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClumsy 1997\n\n\nClumsy is Our Lady Peace's second album. It was released on January 23, 1997 by Sony Records. The album is the band's most successful to date, achieving diamond status in Canada (1,000,000 units sold) and strong sales in other countries.\n\nClumsy's songs feature the striking vocals of lead vocalist Raine Maida, who utilizes an often jarring falsetto technique: Maida jumps from lower octaves in his vocal range to higher ones. Raine's vocals provide most of the melody of the songs, with guitars quieted down in this album compared to Naveed, their previous album. This aspect of singing has become the staple sound of the band, continuing with this fashion in their next studio album Happiness...Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch, and since lost on their most recent album Healthy in Paranoid Times. The album features five hit singles, &quot;Superman's Dead,&quot; &quot;Automatic Flowers,&quot; &quot;Clumsy,&quot; &quot;4 A.M.&quot; and &quot;Carnival&quot;. Each single has its own music video, with the exception of Carnival.\n\nIt has been rumored that the album was originally supposed to be called Trapeze, after a song of the same name that never ended up being featured on the album. A trapeze artist is clearly visible on the cover of the album, which has been used as evidence to support this theory. Despite the fact that the band has performed &quot;Trapeze&quot; live on several occasions, neither an official studio nor live version of the song has ever been released. Raine also stated in interviews prior to the album's release that it was to be titled Trapeze or Propeller.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Superman's Dead&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16 \n2.\t&quot;Automatic Flowers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05 \n3.\t&quot;Carnival&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48 \n4.\t&quot;Big Dumb Rocket&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23 \n5.\t&quot;4 A.M.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17 \n6.\t&quot;Shaking&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37 \n7.\t&quot;Clumsy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29 \n8.\t&quot;Hello Oskar&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:03 \n9.\t&quot;Let You Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53 \n10.\t&quot;The Story of 100 Aisles&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45 \n11.\t&quot;Car Crash&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappinessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Is Not a Fish You Can Catch 1999\n\n\nHappiness... Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch is Our Lady Peace's third album. It was released on September 21, 1999 by Sony Records. It peaked at #2 on the Canadian Albums Chart.\n\nThe songs on Happiness... focus on a lighter melody, often following vocalist Raine Maida's extreme range of octaves sung in a falsetto-like manner. He could travel from one octave to another with ease and very smoothly. This created a very surreal effect to the songs, best shown on songs like &quot;Happiness &amp; the Fish&quot;, &quot;Blister&quot; and &quot;Lying Awake&quot;, much like &quot;Big Dumb Rocket&quot; from Clumsy. The overall sound was quite a departure from their first album, Naveed, featuring very toned-down guitars and the addition of synthesizers and other instruments, typical in most alternative rock albums.\n\nThe lyrics on the album are mostly written in the first-person. The lyrics are usually about unusual themesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½laziness, isolation, loneliness and happiness, most explained in a metaphorical manner. The track &quot;Lying Awake&quot; was said to be about Benny Hinn, and how Raine Maida viewed him as a con-artist, trying to scam people into religion[citation needed]. &quot;Annie&quot; is said to be about a girl who is made an outcast, and ends up killing everybody in the end, similar to Pearl Jam's song &quot;Jeremy&quot; on their dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©but album Ten. The band has said in many interviews that &quot;Thief&quot; was about Mina Kim, a girl the band knew who was dying of a brain tumor.[citation needed]\n\nHit singles from Happiness... include &quot;One Man Army&quot;, &quot;Is Anybody Home?&quot;, and &quot;Thief&quot;. The final track on the CD, &quot;Stealing Babies&quot;, features Elvin Jones, a famous jazz drummer who died in 2004.\n\nRaine Maida has stated that the album is so tight and so well executed because the band only recorded 12 songs during the Happiness sessions, instead of recording 20 or more like they did with their previous two albums[citation needed]. This allowed each song to have the utmost attention given to it while being written. The only recorded song that did not make the album was the long running concert favorite &quot;Trapeze&quot;[citation needed], which had previously been recorded, and left off of &quot;Clumsy&quot;\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;One Man Army&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22 \n2.\t&quot;Happiness &amp; the Fish&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34 \n3.\t&quot;Potato Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27 \n4.\t&quot;Blister&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57 \n5.\t&quot;Is Anybody Home?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37 \n6.\t&quot;Waited&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32 \n7.\t&quot;Thief&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01 \n8.\t&quot;Lying Awake&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02 \n9.\t&quot;Annie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02 \n10.\t&quot;Consequence of Laughing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16 \n11.\t&quot;Stealing Babies&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:30 \n12.\t&quot;The Needle And The Damage Done&quot; (Neil Young cover) - 3:44 (Best Buy/Japanese bonus track) \n13.\t&quot;Clumsy&quot; - 4:29 (Japanese bonus track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpiritual Machines 2000\n\n\nSpiritual Machines is the title of Our Lady Peace's fourth album. It was released on December 12, 2000 by Sony Records. It was inspired by the book The Age of Spiritual Machines by Ray Kurzweil.\n\nSpiritual Machines would mark the end of an era for Our Lady Peace. It was the last album to be produced by Arnold Lanni, the last studio album to feature Sol Fox on its cover, the last to feature Raine Maida's prominent falsetto vocals, the last to feature prominently metaphorical and fantasy-based poetic lyrics, and the last album that guitarist Mike Turner worked on in full. Over the course of recording of the album, percussionist Jeremy Taggart suffered a serious ankle injury during a mugging. While he recovered, Taggart's friend Matt Cameron, current drummer for Pearl Jam, filled in for Taggart on the tracks &quot;Right Behind You (Mafia)&quot; and &quot;Are You Sad?&quot;.[1]\n\nThe album artwork was created by Oli Goldsmith, who also directed the video for &quot;In Repair&quot;. Exactly 16:37 into the last song on the album &quot;The Wonderful Future&quot;, there is a hidden track with Ray Kurzweil communicating with 'Molly'. Molly is a robot from 2099, who at the beginning of the book was a 23 year old woman who knew nothing about what Kurzweil was trying to explain, and then started to evolve in the way Kurzweil predicted.\n\nThe album is Our Lady Peace's least commercially successful to date. Spiritual Machines' lack of success is attributed to the experimentation of spoken excerpts from the book being included on the album.[citation needed] Despite being the least commercially successful album, many have considered Spiritual Machines to be the highlight of the bands creativity, before they adopted a more mainstream sound and abandoned Raine Maida's falsetto vocals with their next album, Gravity.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;R.K.

It was released on June 18, 2002 by Sony Records. The album became a worldwide success, topping charts both in Canada and the U.S. with many hit singles, most notably &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; and &quot;Innocent&quot;.\n\nThe album title, Gravity, was inspired by the chorus lyrics &quot;Falling back to me, defying gravity&quot; from the track &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot;. At the time of the album's release, OLP drummer Jeremy Taggart said that Gravity was &quot;by far [their] best album&quot;\n\nDespite its success, many critics panned the album. They said the album developed a more extreme &quot;mainstream sound&quot; and was &quot;overproduced&quot;, this may have been partly due to new producer Bob Rock of Aerosmith and Metallica fame. This album was a big change from their last successful album, Happiness...Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch. Vocalist Raine Maida's falsetto is completely gone from this album. Instead, a more clean, mainstream sound is introduced.\nOn November 26, 2002 a deluxe limited edition version of the album was released. This version, with a different cover, came with a special bonus DVD of live tracks and music videos (see below). The back cover states that the live tracks were recorded on the Spiritual Machines Tour of 2001. \n\nRecently, Gravity`s single &quot;Innocent&quot; received widespread media attention when American Idol winner David Cook performed it on the program. Many, including American Idol judges, criticized both Cook's performance and song choice. Vocalist Raine Maida reportedly contacted Cook and they have since written some songs together.[2]\n\nThe Song &quot;Not Enough&quot; was also used to make a WWF Desire tribute video to Jeff Hardy and Lita.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;All For You&quot; - 4:14 \n2.\t&quot;Do You Like It&quot; - 3:58 \n3.\t&quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; - 4:11 \n4.\t&quot;Innocent&quot; - 3:42 \n5.\t&quot;Made of Steel&quot; - 3:41 \n6.\t&quot;Not Enough&quot; - 4:33 \n7.\t&quot;Sell My Soul&quot; - 4:20 \n8.\t&quot;Sorry&quot; - 3:18 \n9.\t&quot;Bring Back the Sun&quot; - 4:11 \n10.\t&quot;A Story About a Girl&quot; - 4:18 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthy in Paranoid Times 2005\n\n\nHealthy in Paranoid Times is Canadian rock band Our Lady Peace's sixth studio album, released on August 30, 2005. The disc was released on a regular audio disc as well as a DualDisc, with the DVD side containing a documentary on the making of the album. The album fared well in both Canada and the U.S., but didn't match up to the expectations of their previous smash hit, Gravity.\n\nHealthy in Paranoid Times has a lighter sound and tone, and is less metaphorical than OLP's pre-2002 releases. The second single, however, &quot;Angels/Losing/Sleep&quot; has vocalist Raine Maida singing at a higher pitch, making the jarred, falsetto-like voice Raine Maida and Our Lady Peace was formerly known for. More songs, like &quot;Boy&quot;, also have a lighter melody and vocals, instead of the heavier sounds on Gravity, but do not have the falsetto. The album deals with current world events, and discusses issues such as war and the current state of the world, rather than the social and relationship themes featured on Gravity. It has been classified as a politically-charged album.\n\nThe first single was &quot;Where Are You?&quot;, released in Canada on June 28, 2005 and released in the United States on July 18, 2005. The second single was &quot;Angels/Losing/Sleep&quot;. The third and final single was &quot;Will the Future Blame Us&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Angels/Losing/Sleep&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31 \n2.\t&quot;Will the Future Blame Us&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26 \n3.\t&quot;Picture&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35 \n4.\t&quot;Where Are You?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06 \n5.\t&quot;Wipe That Smile Off Your Face&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24 \n6.\t&quot;Love and Trust&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21 \n7.\t&quot;Boy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35 \n8.\t&quot;Apology&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46 \n9.\t&quot;The World on a String&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25 \n10.\t&quot;Don't Stop&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45 \n11.\t&quot;Walking in Circles&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33 \n12.\t&quot;Al Genina (Leave the Light On)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:14 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurn Burn 2009\n\n\nBurn Burn is the seventh and most recent studio album by Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace, released in North America on July 21, 2009.[2][4] The album's title is based on a quote by Jack Kerouac from his 1957 novel On the Road.[5]\n\nThe album, recorded at vocalist Raine Maida's home studio in Los Angeles between 2007 and 2009,[1] was released independent of any major label under the band's longtime management company Coalition Entertainment. Sony Music (the band's previous label) distributed the album in Canada,[2][6] and WMG's Independent Label Group did so in the United States.[2]\n\nBurn Burn is Our Lady Peace's first album not to have involved collaboration with an outside producer, having instead been produced by band vocalist Raine Maida.[6] The album's release marked the longest gap between Our Lady Peace studio albums to date, with their previous album, Healthy in Paranoid Times, having been released in August 2005. At 38 minutes, Burn Burn is also their shortest album.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;All You Did Was Save My Life&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Dreamland&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Monkey Brains&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;The End Is Where We Begin&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Escape Artist&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Refuge&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Never Get Over You&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;White Flags&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Signs of Life&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Paper Moon&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Decade  2006\n\n\nA Decade is Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace's first compilation album, released on November 21, 2006 in Canada, and November 28, 2006 in the United States. Included on the album are top tracks &quot;Where Are You&quot;, &quot;Clumsy&quot;, &quot;In Repair&quot;, &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot;, &quot;Innocent&quot;, &quot;Thief&quot;, &quot;Naveed&quot;, &quot;Starseed&quot; and &quot;4 A.M.&quot;. Also included are the two unreleased songs &quot;Kiss on the Mouth&quot; and &quot;Better Than Here&quot;.\n\nThe Canadian release of the album includes a bonus DVD containing live footage of the songs &quot;Picture&quot;, &quot;Thief&quot;, &quot;Innocent&quot;, &quot;Where Are You&quot;, &quot;Wipe That Smile Off Your Face&quot;, and &quot;Clumsy&quot; shot on November 6, 2005 at Massey Hall in Toronto. It also includes interviews with the current band members, behind the scenes footage, a photo gallery, and discography with lyrics.\n\n&quot;4am&quot; and &quot;One Man Army&quot; have been remixed from their original album versions.\n\n&quot;In Repair&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; appear with narration from Ray Kurzweil's book The Age of Spiritual Machines, which inspired the album Spiritual Machines, on which the two song were featured. The narration on &quot;Life&quot; was not issued on Spiritual Machines.\n\nThe first single from the album was &quot;Kiss on the Mouth&quot;, released in Canada in September 2006.\n\nThe band has stated that this will be the last album featuring Saul Fox on the cover.[citation needed] Previously, Fox was seen on the covers of Our Lady Peace's first four albums.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Starseed&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;The Birdman&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Naveed&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Superman's Dead&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Clumsy&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;4am&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;One Man Army&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Is Anybody Home?&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Thief&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;In Repair&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Life&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Somewhere Out There&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Innocent&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Where Are You&quot;  \n15.\t&quot;Angels/Losing/Sleep&quot;  \n16.\t&quot;Will the Future Blame Us&quot;  \n17.\t&quot;Kiss on the Mouth&quot;  \n18.\t&quot;Better Than Here&quot; (demo)\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e6d2e46bf28c6d7686dce028ff2efc3a4989b31","amp;dn":"Our+Lady+Peace+-+Discography+1994+-+2009+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e6d2e46bf28c6d7686dce028ff2efc3a4989b31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,109,46,70,191,40,198,215,104,109,206,2,143,242,239,195,164,152,155,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
