Ross\n\nMaya and 3ds Max are two of the most widely used commercial software packages for 3D graphics. Artists and studios commonly leverage the strengths of both toolsets, resulting in production pipelines that use more than one package. Whether you're switching to one of these programs, using both at the same time, or simply need to move assets back and forth, this course illustrates invaluable techniques and best practices for integrating these two powerful Autodesk applications. Aaron F. Ross shows how to manage assets, harmonize the interfaces and preferences, and transfer data, materials, and scenes, making the transition between Maya and 3ds Max as seamless as possible.\nTopics include:\n\n    Managing and tracking assets\n    Setting up a shared texture library\n    Streamlining user interfaces\n    Using Maya mode hotkeys in 3ds Max\n    Harmonizing scene units and frame rates\n    Rendering procedural textures to bitmaps\n    Translating scenes with the FBX file format\n    Correcting materials, lighting, and surfaces\n    Using the Send To command\n    Baking animation to keyframes\n    Saving a geometry cache\n    Distilling complex animation with Alembic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36eff8f10ac3ca0269385d8302055eb8fcbe2c3b","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+3ds+Max+2015+Tutorials+%7C+3ds+Max+and+Maya+Integration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36eff8f10ac3ca0269385d8302055eb8fcbe2c3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,239,248,241,10,195,202,2,105,56,93,131,2,5,94,184,252,190,44,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
