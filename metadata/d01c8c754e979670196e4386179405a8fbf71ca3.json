But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not to say that the Black Keys are blues traditionalists: even on their 2002 debut, The Big Come Up, they covered the BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ psychedelic classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“She Said She Said,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ indicating a fascination with sound and texture that would later take hold on such latter-day albums as 2008Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Attack &amp; Release, where guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney teamed up with sonic architect Danger Mouse. In between those two records, the duo established the Black Keys as a rock &amp; roll band with a brutal, primal force, and songwriters of considerable depth, as evidenced on such fine albums as 2003Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Thickfreakness and 2004Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Rubber Factory.\n\n\nGenre................: Alternative Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Covers, Cue, Audiochecker\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.Weight Of Love\n02.In Time\n03.Turn Blue\n04.Fever\n05.Year In Review\n06.Bullet In The Brain\n07.It's Up To You Now\n08.Waiting On Words\n09.10 Lovers\n10.In Our Prime\n11.Gotta Get Away\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n  Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d01c8c754e979670196e4386179405a8fbf71ca3","amp;dn":"The+Black+Keys+-+Turn+Blue+%282014%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d01c8c754e979670196e4386179405a8fbf71ca3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,28,140,117,78,151,150,112,25,110,67,134,23,148,5,168,251,247,28,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
