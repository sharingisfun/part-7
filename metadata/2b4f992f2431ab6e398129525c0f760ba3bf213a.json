Employee monitor successfully achieves these goals by monitoring your employees' working environment. Employee Monitor records all the computer activities of your employees such as typed keystrokes, visited websites, used programs, time spent at the computer.\n\nIn addition, Employee Monitor lets you increase productivity by blocking activities that are not work related such as Facebook, instant messengers, entertainment content, and games. It is the best way to block Facebook in Google Chrome. Also you can block all websites except whitelist. Simple in installation and usage, the program does not need any additional knowledge or equipment. Start using Employee Monitor and see the results of improved employee productivity.\n\nKey features:\n=============\n\nWeb History:\n------------\n\nThe most important feature in regards to monitored activities is a list of visited websites, which highlights employee activities that are not work-related. The Web History feature records the URLs and page titles of visited websites, as well as timestamps. Even if employees clear their web browser's history it does not hide their viewing of inappropriate internet content. The program is compatible with all versions of the following browsers: Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and others.\n\nKeystrokes Recorded:\n--------------------\n\nOur employee monitoring software records all typed keystrokes in any application including chat, email, word processing, web browsers and others. The Keystroke History log report includes typed text, title of document, and timestamps. See exactly what employees type on the computer!\n\nApplication monitoring:\n-----------------------\n\nAnother feature of our Employee Monitor is the tracking of applications used by employees. It lets you find out if an employee is wasting time at work (playing solitaire instead of working). The detail log reports will tell you exactly which applications were run and when, and also record application window titles so you can see exactly what your employee was doing.\n\nScreenshot Capturing:\n---------------------\n\nScreenshot history provides visualization of employees' activities which can make it obvious just what employees are doing. Employee Monitor captures a full color computer screenshot with customizable intervals and image quality.\n\n\n\n=================================================================\n\n\nFor anyone WHO MAY HAVE issues with installation, extraction, wrong file extensions, passwords etc for this or any of my other installer torrents.
