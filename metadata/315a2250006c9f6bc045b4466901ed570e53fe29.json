Her\r\nvivid   imagination   created   a   place    called\r\nWonderland, a world full of magic,  white  rabbits,\r\nand tea parties. Then a man  named  American  McGee\r\nentered the picture,  and  everything  changed.  He\r\ntossed the storybook out the window and gave  us  a\r\nseriously sinister version of this well-known tale.\r\nAfter losing everything  in  a  house  fire,  going\r\ninsane,  living  in  a  mental   institution,   and\r\nexploring a disturbing version of Wonderland, you'd\r\nthink that  McGee  would  be  done  torturing  poor\r\nAlice. Well, think again. After 10 years, Alice may\r\nbe ready to leave the institute and start over, but\r\nMcGee has other plans for our heroine.  Haunted  by\r\nfrightening images of her dead parents, she  begins\r\nto question how  &quot;accidental&quot;  their  death  really\r\nwas. Driven to madness again, Alice tries to escape\r\nto Wonderland, but the entire world is in  shambles\r\nthanks to her mental state.  The  land  is  stained\r\nwith blood, and the creatures are completely broken\r\ndown. The only way  out  is  through  the  madness:\r\nAlice must confront and conquer her demons to  save\r\nher sanity and restore Wonderland.\r\n\r\nThe Complete Edition includes:\r\n\r\n* Alice: Madness Returns  Weapons  Of  Madness  And\r\nDresses Pack - Return to  Wonderland  and  battle\r\nthe corruption with all new  weapon  upgrades  as\r\nwell as 6 new collectible dresses.\r\n\r\n* Bonus Game - The original American McGee's  Alice\r\nincludes  the  original  2000  PC  game  American\r\nMcGee's Alice.
