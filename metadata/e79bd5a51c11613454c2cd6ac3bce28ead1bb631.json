By raising and harvesting their own fruits, vegetables, chickens, bees, milk-bearing animals, and more, people are growing locally, sustainably, and at a fraction of the cost. However, poor planning for needs, proper use of available space, and a lack of preparedness for preserving or selling the harvest can quickly lead to wasted time and sweat.\n\nBackyard Farming on an Acre (More or Less) is written by people who have planned and run a successful small-scale backyard farm. The authors guide readers through the essentials of planning a small-scale farm from a 1/4 acre all the way up to an acre and beyond. Readers will learn how to decide how large (or small) their farm should be, what they should plant or raise based on their individual wants and needs (and available space), and how they can prevent their efforts from being wasted. Proven, sustainable techniques will be presented to readers so they can yield the maximum benefit of their harvest through proven best practices. Readers will also learn how to raise small animals such as chickens and goats for milk, eggs, and meat, and will learn the critical practices for successfully parenting bees, growing fruit tress, and much more.\n\n\nBy Angela England\nPublished by DK Publishing in 2012\nTags: nonfiction, gardening, farming\nEPUB, Retail, 434 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e79bd5a51c11613454c2cd6ac3bce28ead1bb631","amp;dn":"Backyard+Farming+on+an+Acre%28ePUB%2CAZW3%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e79bd5a51c11613454c2cd6ac3bce28ead1bb631","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,155,213,165,28,17,97,52,84,194,205,106,195,188,226,142,173,27,182,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
