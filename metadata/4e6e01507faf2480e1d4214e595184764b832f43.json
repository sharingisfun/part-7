Analytical Chemistry for Technicians, Third Edition explains analytical chemistry and instrumental analysis principles and how to apply them in the real world. A unique feature of this edition is that it brings the workplace of the chemical technician into the classroom.\n\nWith over 50 workplace scene sidebars, it offers stories and photographs of technicians and chemists working with the equipment or performing the techniques discussed in the text. It includes a supplemental CD that enhances training activities. The author incorporates knowledge gained from a number of American Chemical Society and PITTCON short courses and from personal visits to several laboratories at major chemical plants, where he determined firsthand what is important in the modern analytical laboratory. \n\nThe book includes more than sixty experiments specifically relevant to the laboratory technician, along with a Questions and Problems section in each chapter. Analytical Chemistry for Technicians, Third Edition continues to offer the nuts and bolts of analytical chemistry while focusing on the practical aspects of training","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e6e01507faf2480e1d4214e595184764b832f43","amp;dn":"Analytical+Chemistry+for+Technicians+3rd+ed+-+John+Kenkel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e6e01507faf2480e1d4214e595184764b832f43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,110,1,80,127,175,36,128,225,212,33,78,89,81,132,118,75,131,47,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
