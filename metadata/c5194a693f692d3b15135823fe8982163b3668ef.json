I know this does not include Eleven Promos, Collected, Singles Box Set or Live With Me.  It really annoys me to download discographies of bands that have multiple songs doubles up, hence why they are not included.  Feedback is welcome.  I will seed as much as I possibly can.  Please enjoy Massive Attack in all their incredible glory.  All CD covers are included and all of the files are tagged properly and tags include the CD cover image.\n\n\nNote:  only 2 tracks are tagged incorrect according to artist, which are track 22 and 23 of the Unleashed Soundtrack.  The correct artist is in parenthesis after song name in the tag, this is so iTunes/iPods/etc don&amp;#039;t turn retarded when it comes to how the songs are listed.\n\n\n\nAll Files are MPEG 1 Layer III ripped at 320kbit/s and 44100 Hz\n\n\nIncluded are the following:\n\n\nMassive Attack - Blue Lines\n\n    1.
