The band combined a raw punk rock sound with their own brand of energy and enthusiasm. The lyrics are original often cynical (see Judy is a punk and Beat on the brat.) While listening to this album, I realized what a great bassist the late Dee Dee Ramone was (R.I.P. man.) \nThis compliation also has the hit ''Pet Sematary'' that was written for the Stephen King movie and wasn't included on any of their studio albums. \nSo what are you waiting for? Have it NOW! \n\nby Falkor The White Luck Dragon\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Blitzkrieg Bop.wma                                     \n02 - Beat On The Brat.wma                                   \n03 - Judy Is A Punk.wma                                     \n04 - I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend.wma                          \n05 - Sheena Is A Punk Rocker (ABC Single Version).wma       \n06 - Pinhead.wma                                            \n07 - Commando.wma                                           \n08 - Rockaway Beach.wma                                     \n09 - We're A Happy Family.wma                               \n10 - Cretin Hop.wma                                         \n11 - Teenage Lobotomy.wma                                   \n12 - I Wanna Be Sedated.wma                                 \n13 - I Just Want To Have Something To Do.wma                \n14 - Rock 'n' Roll High School (Ed Stasium Mix).wma         \n15 - Baby, I Love You.wma                                   \n16 - Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio.wma                \n17 - The Kkk Took My Baby Away.wma                          \n18 - Outsider.wma                                           \n19 - Pet Sematary (Single Version).wma                      \n20 - Wart Hog.wma                 \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eec03ed6deedc589aa71238bf143ae99d432ff00","amp;dn":"Ramones+-+Greatest+Hits+%282006%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eec03ed6deedc589aa71238bf143ae99d432ff00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,192,62,214,222,237,197,137,170,113,35,139,241,67,174,153,212,50,255,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
