But the millionaire's will clearly stipulates that Daffy must use the money for the common good, by providing a service, and should Daffy think of pursuing selfish aims, the millionaire's ghost will &quot;repossess&quot; his millions by making them disappear from Earthly existence. Under the pretense of community service, Daffy opens an exorcism agency and employs Porky Pig, Sylvester Cat, and Bugs Bunny to track and eliminate ghosts, ghouls, and other monsters, while Daffy secretly schemes to use his learned &quot;ghost-busting&quot; talents to rid himself of the millionaire's nagging spirit.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FAIjlaAea&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FAIjlaAea&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat            : AVI at 1063 Kbps\nLength            : 1 GiB for 3h 21mn 49s 360ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 937 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 576 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 320 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3394793651461c1d01505b6edbce363aa883f3f8","amp;dn":"Daffy+Duck%27s+Quackbusters+%281988%29+Greek+audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3394793651461c1d01505b6edbce363aa883f3f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,148,121,54,81,70,28,29,1,80,91,110,219,206,54,58,168,131,243,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
