The film was developed from a script titled The Cellar, but under production by Bad Robot, it was turned into a spiritual successor of the 2008 film Cloverfield. The film follows a young woman who is held in an underground bunker with two men who insist that a hostile event has left the surface of the Earth uninhabitable. The film is presented in a third-person narrative, in contrast to its predecessor's found footage style.\r\n\r\n10 Cloverfield Lane was released in the United States on March 11, 2016[5] in conventional and IMAX theaters. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances of the cast, as well as the film's tense and suspenseful atmosphere.\r\nCast:-\r\nCast\r\nMary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle\r\nJohn Goodman as Howard Stambler\r\nJohn Gallagher, Jr. as Emmett DeWitt\r\nBradley Cooper as Ben (voice)\r\nSuzanne Cryer as Leslie\r\n\r\nEncoding Details:-\r\nFile Name-10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) 720p BRRip x264 English AAC Encoded By-RishiBhai\r\nLanguage-English\r\nResolution-1280 x720p\r\nSource-1080p Rarbg(Thanks!!!)\r\nSubtitles-eSubs\r\nAudio Bitrate-80\r\nAudio Mixdown-Dolby Surround\r\nFile Size-441MB\r\nSample-Included in torrent\r\n\r\nScreenshots:-\r\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2016/07/19/34f2f7.png[/img]\r\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2016/07/19/27e697.png[/img]\r\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2016/07/19/5.png[/img]\r\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2016/07/19/6.png[/img]\r\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2016/07/19/4.png[/img]\r\n\r\nUploader's Note:-\r\nIt's time for some hollywood horror thriller movie...i have encoded this movie with 2 pass encoding...special thanks goes to Rarbg for the source and 22BigDaddy for seeding","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbb7ddc918a540be3c63c989c1f2fc0780c48495","amp;dn":"10+Cloverfield+Lane+%282016%29+720p+BRRip+x264+English+AAC+Encoded+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbb7ddc918a540be3c63c989c1f2fc0780c48495","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,183,221,201,24,165,64,190,60,99,201,137,193,242,252,7,128,196,132,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
