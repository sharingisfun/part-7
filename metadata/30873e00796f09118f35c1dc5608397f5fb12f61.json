Whether you have been scammed in business, swindled out of money, betrayed by a friend, relative, or coworker, or cheated on by a spouse, rest assured you are not alone. The world is full of these most toxic people--liars.\n\nYou can never be sure if people are lying until you analyze their body language, facial expressions, speech patterns, even their online writing patterns.\n\nNow, world-renowned body language expert Dr. Lillian Glass shares with you the same quick and easy approach she uses to unmask signals of deception--from &quot;innocent&quot; little white lies to life-changing whoppers.\n\nFeaturing photographs of celebrities and newsmakers such as Bill Clinton, Lance Armstrong, O.J. Simpson, Kim Kardashian, Lindsay Lohan, and many others at the actual moment they were lying, their specific signals of deception will be permanently etched in your mind. Analyzing the body language of troubled or divorced couples such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise, and Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore, you'll learn the &quot;obvious&quot; signs to look for.\n\n\n\nBy Lillian Glass\nPublished by Career Press in 2013\nEPUB, Retail, 224 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30873e00796f09118f35c1dc5608397f5fb12f61","amp;dn":"The+Body+Language+of+Liars%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30873e00796f09118f35c1dc5608397f5fb12f61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,135,62,0,121,111,9,17,143,53,193,220,86,8,57,127,95,177,47,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
