When the officers arrived at his home they found the bloody and battered bodies of MacDonaldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pregnant wife and two young daughters. The word Ã¢â‚¬Å“pigÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was written in blood on the headboard in the master bedroom. As MacDonald was being loaded into the ambulance, he accused a band of drug-crazed hippies of the crime.\n\nSo began one of the most notorious and mysterious murder cases of the twentieth century. Jeffrey MacDonald was finally convicted in 1979 and remains in prison today. Since then a number of bestselling booksÃ¢â‚¬â€including Joe McGinnissÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fatal Vision and Janet MalcolmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Journalist and the MurdererÃ¢â‚¬â€and a blockbuster television miniseries have told their versions of the MacDonald case and what it all means.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - August 28th 2012\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6b1c7183c09b71268753e8570d54a69338492b9","amp;dn":"A+Wilderness+of+Error+by+Errol+Morris+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6b1c7183c09b71268753e8570d54a69338492b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,177,199,24,60,9,183,18,104,117,62,133,112,213,74,105,51,132,146,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
