When his latest show is axed, he is dismayed to find that the only work he can get is fronting a fake game show that is actually an undercover police sting designed to trap criminals. His reluctance evaporates, however, as the show rockets his career back to prime-time stardom, and when the lovely, shy Stephanie enters his life he thinks he finally has it made. But Larry doesn't know how dangerous those criminals are. He helped imprison some dangerous menÃ¢â‚¬â€and they want revenge.\n================\n\nDovah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df3d3c40f536bb87a494630bddc1f4cf686a8999","amp;dn":"Mandasue+Heller%2C+Shafted+epub+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df3d3c40f536bb87a494630bddc1f4cf686a8999","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,61,60,64,245,54,187,135,164,148,99,11,221,193,244,207,104,106,137,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
