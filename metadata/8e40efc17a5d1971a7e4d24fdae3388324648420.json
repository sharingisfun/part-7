I have gone through and opened each ebook and rated the quality. These are the books that are retail or close to retail (indistinguishable) and included in both libraries.\n\nMany Demonoid members have requested a separate torrent of just the highest quality books, so here it is.\n\nThings you should know before downloading this as opposed to downloading the library:\n\nIt will take longer to add books to Calibre since each book has to be added individually. As opposed to the &quot;switch library&quot; option which will load much quicker.\nBooks will be missing from series because not all books have been released as retail.\n\nAlso, if you haven't done so please download Calibre. It's free and allows you to convert and send books to pretty much any e-reader.
