These features include a partially simulated TMS (Train Management System), pre-defined slow speed running for use in train washes, driver alertness check by sounding the DSD (Driverâ€™s Safety Device) vigilance alarm and even variable density of exhaust â€˜smokeâ€™ when the train is under load.\r\n\r\nAlso included are ten challenging scenarios which employ our exclusive ActivWorld scenario coding - the scenario and your train interact  with each other to make your driving more interesting and realistic. Be prepared for the unexpected!\r\n\r\nThe Class 222 is part of our Advanced range, in which ActivScript technology provides numerous realistic and immersive operations, many of which can be found only in Just Trains add-ons; these include advanced operating controls, realistic systems and authentic sounds.
