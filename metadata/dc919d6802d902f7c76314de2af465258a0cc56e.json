Led by guitarist Rick Nielsen, the band's early albums were filled with highly melodic, well-written songs that drew equally from the crafted pop of the Beatles, the sonic assault of the Who, and the tongue-in-cheek musical eclecticism and humor of the Move. Their sound provided a blueprint for both power pop and arena rock; it also had a surprisingly long-lived effect on both alternative and heavy metal bands of the '80s and '90s, who often relied on the same combination of loud riffs and catchy melodies.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tEpic/Legacy\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.I Want You To Want Me (Live)\n02.Ain't That A Shame\n03.Southern Girls\n04.Surrender\n05.Stop This Game\n06.Dream Police\n07.If You Want My Love\n08.Tonight It's You\n09.Everything Works If You Let It\n10.Mandocello\n11.I Can't Take It (Live)\n12.She's Tight\n13.That 70's Song (Based On In The Street)\n14.Walk Away (Feat.
