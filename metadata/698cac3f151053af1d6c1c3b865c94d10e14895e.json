Send your champions on quests to recover ancient artifacts, gain allies, or obtain the great wealth lost during the Cataclysm.\r\nThe land is not simply waiting to be claimed; it must be conquered. Darkling camps, ogre lairs and caves waiting to be explored dot the landscape. In remote corners of the world, tireless butchermen, fell demons and legendary locations are waiting to be found. Explore Varda, a pre-Cataclysm city defended by golems that have turned on the citizens and made the city into a prison. Defeat Sarog to claim the Temple of the Dragon and recruit Ashwake Dragons to your cause. Claim the Flooded Graveyard or the Pit of Sarpah to harness the powerful magical energy of those locations.\r\nFallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes\r\nThe Fallen Enchantress seeks to destroy the civilizations that have risen from the ashes of the Cataclysm. Fortunately, your fame has spread and great heroes have been drawn to your banner. With your new champions, you will confront new horrors like liches, brood hunters, banshees, and the dreaded hergon.\r\nFallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes is the new standalone expansion to Stardockâ€™s turn-based, fantasy strategy game. Players will forge a new empire in a world sundered by powerful magic, fight against terrible creatures, complete quests and rediscover lost secrets in their bid to rule the world of Elemental.\r\nRecruit Champions - Equip them with rare magical items that you create or discover. Customize your championâ€™s special abilities and traits as they gain levels.\r\nFight in tactical battles - Battle enemy armies or the wild creatures of the world. Command your armies directly and choose between the special attacks and spells your units have learned.\r\nDesign your units - Customize their armor and weapons.

Train them with specialized traits like Discipline and Ignore Pain.\r\nLiberate or Enslave - Transform Elemental into a noble kingdom, or an empire where citizens are fuel for your spells.
