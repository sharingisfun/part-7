Traversing flooded rivers, snow capped mountains and baking hot deserts, hardship tests their friendship as they race toward the capital of Mongolia to witness the country's greatest celebration, the Naadam festival.\r\n\r\nTheir epic journey is a true testament to living on a motorcycle, and a cultural insight into one of the greatest empires in the history of the world, the reign of Chingis Khan's Mongolian Horde. Motonomad II is more than a motorcycle journey, it's a life adventure.\r\n\r\nIf you like the film support the film makers and buy: \r\n \nhttp://motologyfilms.com/portfolio-view/motonomad-ii-3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18c674db1c5cf8e0317c0022a7fe72348f088968","amp;dn":"Motonomad+II+%282016%29+720p+%28Off-road+Moto+Film%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18c674db1c5cf8e0317c0022a7fe72348f088968","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,198,116,219,28,92,248,224,49,124,0,34,167,254,114,52,143,8,137,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
