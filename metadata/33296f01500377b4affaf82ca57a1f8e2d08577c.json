The film, made under reasonably smooth conditions despite the war, is based on a best-selling novel about the creation of Judo. Most of the film explores the relationship between the creator of this form of self-defense and his faithful protege. In addition to establishing the reputation of Kurosawa, the film made a popular star of Susumu Fujita. Sanshiro Sugata was remade by Shigeo Tanaka in 1955 and again by Seiichuro Uchikawa ten years later. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Sugata Sanshiro.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.21 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 18mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 192 Kbps\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Simple@L3\n      Format settings, BVOP : No\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 18mn\n      Bit rate : 1 798 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.244\n      Stream size : 1 014 MiB (82%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 18mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 384 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 217 MiB (18%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 32 ms (0.77 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 512 ms\n\nIMDB: tt0036400\n\nJapanese audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at Secret-Cinema by reeltime","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33296f01500377b4affaf82ca57a1f8e2d08577c","amp;dn":"Akira+Kurosawa+-+Sugata+Sanshiro+%5B1943%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33296f01500377b4affaf82ca57a1f8e2d08577c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,41,111,1,80,3,119,180,175,250,248,44,165,122,31,142,45,8,87,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
