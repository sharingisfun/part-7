It was originally a novella published in The New Yorker and was later expanded to a full length novel. It explores many of the same emotional and cultural themes as her Pulitzer Prize-winning short story collection Interpreter of Maladies. Moving between events in Calcutta, Boston, and New York City, the novel examines the nuances involved with being caught between two conflicting cultures with their highly distinct religious, social, and ideological differences.\n\nThe novel describes the struggles and hardships of a Bengali couple who immigrate to the United States to form a life outside of everything they know.\n\nThe story begins as Ashoke and Ashima leave Calcutta, India and settle in Central Square, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Through a series of errors, their son's nickname, Gogol, becomes his official birth name, an event which will shape many aspects of his life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8791d74f29a30ff76ce1194934c5b760a8a1eaf9","amp;dn":"THE+NAMESAKE+-+Jhumpa+Lahiri.+Read+Sarita+Choudhury+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8791d74f29a30ff76ce1194934c5b760a8a1eaf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,145,215,79,41,163,15,247,108,225,25,73,52,197,183,96,168,161,234,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
