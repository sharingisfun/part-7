His name, Abe Lucas. His reputation : bad. Abe is said to be a womanizer and an alcoholic. But what people do not know is that he is a disillusioned idealist. Since he has become aware of his inability to change the world, he has indeed been living in a state of deep nihilism and arrogant desperation. In class, he only goes through the motions and outside he drinks too much. But as far as sex is concerned, he is just a shadow of himself now: depression is not synonymous with Viagra! For all that, he can't help being attracted to one of his students, pretty and bright Jill Pollard. He enters into a relationship with her which remains platonic, even if Jill would not say no to more. The situation remains unchanged for a while until, one day, in a diner, Abe and Jill surprise a conversation that will change the course of their lives dramatically...                \r\n\r\nYear: 2015                \r\nDirector: Woody Allen                \r\nWriters: Woody Allen                \r\nStars: Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Joe Stapleton, Nancy Carroll, Allison Gallerani, Brigette Lundy-Paine, Katelyn Semer, Betsy Aidem, Ethan Phillips, Jamie Blackley                \r\nGenres: Drama, Mystery                \r\nLanguage: English                \r\n\r\nRELEASE.....................: Irrational.Man.2015.720p.BluRay.x264.VPPV\r\nVIDEO.......................: 1000 kbps  \r\nCODEC.......................: x264\r\nRESOLUTION..................: 1280x534                \r\nFRAME RATE..................: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.......................: 2 Channel / HE-AAC(FDK) / 128kbps                \r\nFILE SIZE / FORMAT..........: 769MB / MP4\r\nSOURCE......................: BluRay                \r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nPoster:  \nhttp://snap.vppv.la/irrational-man/2015/irrational-man-2015-poster.jpg               \r\n\r\nWarning!!!
