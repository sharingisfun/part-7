About ten minutes later, Willie himself makes a cameo as the guy who holds onto the bet money. His character name is also Willie. \n\nThe Hustler while nominated for many awards, lost all the major ones and the main competition at the Oscars were the films Judgment at Nuremberg and West Side Story . In the scene when Eddie takes Sara out to a restaurant just before the Louisville trip, Sara has a line &quot;I feel pretty&quot; which, of course was the title to a major song in West Side Story.\n\nPaul Newman had never held a pool cue before he landed the role of Fast Eddie Felson. He took out the dining room table from his home and installed a pool table so he could spend every waking hour practicing and polishing up his skills. \n\nPaul Newman agreed to make the film having read only half the script. He knew at that stage that it was a great project for him. \n\nOne of the first mainstream Hollywood films to use the word &quot;bastard&quot;. \n\nAn early example of a Hollywood movie with a pre-credits sequence, a rarity at the time.\n\nFOR TRIVIA WITH SPOILERS VISIT IMDB AFTER WATCHING THE MOVIE\n\nDO YOU GUYS LIKE ME TO ADD TRIVIA LIKE THIS FOR ALL MOVIES THAT I RELEASE THEN DO LET ME KNOW WITH YOUR COMMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/bUg8l.png[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/GpVGY.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/txr1O.png[/IMG]\n\nThe Hustler 1961 720p BRRip_sujaidr\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nZdCe.png[/IMG]\n\n\n[TITLE].........................[ The Hustler 1961\n[DIRECTOR]......................[ Robert Rossen\n[RELEASE DATE]..................[   25 September 1961 (USA)\n[FORMAT]:.......................[ Matroska (MKV) \n[GENRE]:........................[     Drama | Sport \n[NO OF CDs].....................[ 1 \n[FILE SIZE]:....................[  898 MB\n[RESOLUTION]:...................[ 1280x544\n[LANGUAGE]:.....................[ ENGLISH\n[SUBTITLES]:....................[ ENGLISH MUXED\n[ORIGINAL RUNTIME]:.............[ 02:14:44\n[RELEASE RUNTIME]:..............[ 02:14:44\n[SOURCE]:                       [ 720p \n\n\n\n\nSAMPLE                  :INCLUDED\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/jHcjQ.png[/IMG]\nuploader\n sujaidr\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/UzVN6.png[/IMG]\n\nPLOT:&quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Felson is a small-time pool hustler with a lot of talent but a self-destructive attitude. His bravado causes him to challenge the legendary &quot;Minnesota Fats&quot; to a high-stakes match, but he loses in a heartbreaking marathon. Now broke and without his long-time manager, Felson faces an uphill battle to regain his confidence and his game. It isn't until he hits rock bottom that he agrees to join up with ruthless and cutthroat manager Bert Gordon. Gordon agrees to take him on the road to learn the ropes. But Felson soon realizes that making it to the top could cost him his soul, and perhaps his girlfriend. Will he decide that this is too steep a price to pay in time to save himself?\n\nDirector: Robert Rossen\n\nStars:                   Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason and Piper Laurie\nimdb:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054997/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054997/&lt;/a&gt;  \n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7liX3.png[/IMG]\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/ryhpr.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/ryhpr.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/G0PHW.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/G0PHW.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/k3M2f.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/k3M2f.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/OHSsz.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/OHSsz.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wF4BC.png[/IMG]\n\n         to visit my facebook page for requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FkbPX.gif[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c874eba9fad4257e156f5bc4b0e7d7da832bde83","amp;dn":"The+Hustler+1961+720p+BRRip_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c874eba9fad4257e156f5bc4b0e7d7da832bde83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,116,235,169,250,212,37,126,21,111,91,196,176,231,215,218,131,43,222,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
