M. Barrie's classic novel, Peter Pan. Read to you by Jim Dale, winner of many Audie awards for the Harry Potter Series. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do. Jim Dale will ruin you for any other narrator. He is amazing. I love his work. \n\nCompletely Chapterized for easy bookmarking. \n\nFiles formatted with chapter names (i.e. Chapter 02a ~ The Sweater) &lt;&lt;totally made up chapter name, just an example haha :)\n\nAlbum name: Peter Pan\nAlbum Artist: J.M. Barrie\nArtist: Read by Jim Dale \nGenre: Spoken &amp; Audio\n\nshould add to iTunes as audiobook files.\n\nThis has great quality audio. Ripped from CDs into iTunes. I formatted all the track names for stress free use and organization! \n\nI can't tell you how many audiobook torrents have &quot;track1, track2, etc.&quot; and album/artist names that don't match....really people...really?\n\nP.S. I realize I forgot to number the tracks so the easiest way to keep them in order is by putting the tracks in alphabetical order and change the &quot;introduction&quot; track to &quot;Chapter 00&quot; and it should work out fine Otherwise you can manually add the track #s if you would like.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6564415b09dedcfc56bd46554ab4ce1c09366641","amp;dn":"Peter+Pan+-+J+M+Barrie++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6564415b09dedcfc56bd46554ab4ce1c09366641","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,100,65,91,9,222,220,252,86,189,70,85,74,180,206,28,9,54,102,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
