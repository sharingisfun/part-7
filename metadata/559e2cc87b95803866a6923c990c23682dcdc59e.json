It may seem strange to have to study in such\ndetail something you do unconsciously in your mother\ntongue but my aim is to simplify the world of verbs by\nstripping them back to the very basics and taking you on a\njourney that will allow you to eventually structure your own\nsentences with ease.\nLinguistic terminology can be confusing for some and it may\nwell be the reason why many people stop learning languages\naltogether. But avoiding the technical terms can be even\nmore confusing than learning them and I believe that\nlabelling helps us to understand the construction of language\nand eventually helps us to think independently when building\nsentences. Do not fret. Any such terminology is written in\nbold and is explained fully in the glossary at the back of this\nbook.
