The story &quot;Nakhalyonok&quot;, partially based on his own childhood, was later made into a popular film.\n\nIn the same year Sholokhov began writing the epic novel AND QUIET FLOWS THE DON which earned the Stalin Prize and took him fourteen years to complete (1926Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1940).  It became the most-read work of Soviet fiction and was heralded as a powerful example of socialist realism, and it earned him the 1965 Nobel Prize in Literature.  It deals with the lives and struggles of the don Cossacks before and during World War I and the Russian Civil War.\n\nThis was followed by THE DON FLOWS HOME TO THE SEA (1928-1940) which depicts the destruction of Cossack society during the Civil War.  It tells the story of Grigory Melekhov and his tragic affair with Aksinia, the wife of a neighbour, and how he fights for the Reds, the Whites, and the Partisans.\n\nHARVEST ON THE DON (1960) also reflects life during collectivization in the Don area.  THE FATE OF A MAN, a short story published in 1957 and made into a popular Russian film directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, is here provided in two translations.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format:\n\n* AND QUIET FLOWS THE DON (Penguin, 1967).
