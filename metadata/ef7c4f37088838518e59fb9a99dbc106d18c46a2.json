In the book, Said effectively redefined the term &quot;Orientalism&quot; to mean a constellation of false assumptions underlying Western attitudes toward the Middle East. This body of scholarship is marked by a &quot;subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against Arabo-Islamic peoples and their culture.&quot; He argued that a long tradition of romanticized images of Asia and the Middle East in Western culture had served as an implicit justification for European and American colonial and imperial ambitions. Just as fiercely, he denounced the practice of Arab elites who internalized the US and British orientalists' ideas of Arabic culture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef7c4f37088838518e59fb9a99dbc106d18c46a2","amp;dn":"Orientalism+by+Edward+Said+%28unabridged+audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef7c4f37088838518e59fb9a99dbc106d18c46a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,124,79,55,8,136,56,81,142,89,251,154,153,219,193,6,209,140,70,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
