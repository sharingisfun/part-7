The closing track,\n&quot;Got to Be Free&quot;, is an anthem for maintaining personal independence in the face of all\nopposition. Musically, the album is an extremely varied affair, contrasting gentle ballads like\n&quot;Get Back in Line&quot; and &quot;A Long Way From Home&quot; against songs like &quot;Rats&quot; and &quot;Powerman&quot;,\ntwo of the hardest rockers in the Kinks repertoire. &quot;Denmark Street&quot; and &quot;The\nMoneygoround&quot;, like much of Ray Davies's work, pay homage to the English music hall\ntradition.\n\nThe album's most famous song and a worldwide hit single, &quot;Lola&quot;, is about an encounter with\na tranvestite. Encouraged by his father, Davies consciously and carefully crafted the song to\nbe a hit after a long dry spell for the band on both the U.K. and U.S. charts. He was even\nforced to fly from the United States to England to overdub the trademarked word &quot;Coca-Cola&quot;\nfrom the original master tape to prevent potential legal problems. The success of the single\nand album had important ramifications for the band's career at a critical time, allowing them to\nnegotiate a new contract with RCA Records, construct their own London Studio and assume\nmore creative and managerial control. &quot;Lola&quot; also became their most popular sing-a-long\nanthem at concerts, as they struggled to regain a footing in the U.S. concert market after the\nAmerican Federation of Musicians, who had refused permits for the group to perform\nconcerts there since 1965, relented in 1969.\n\n\n\n1.
