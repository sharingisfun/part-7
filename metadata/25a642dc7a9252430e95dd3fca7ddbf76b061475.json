Including numerous worked examples and diagrams, further exercises have been incorporated into the text and answers are provided at the back of the book. Topics include phase plane analysis, nonlinear damping, small parameter expansions and singular perturbations, stability, Liapunov methods, Poincare sequences, homoclinic bifurcation and Liapunov exponents. Over 500 end-of-chapter problems are also included and as an additional resource fully-worked solutions to these are provided in the accompanying text Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations: Problems and Solutions, (OUP, 2007). Both texts cover a wide variety of applications while keeping mathematical prequisites to a minimum making these an ideal resource for students and lecturers in engineering, mathematics and the sciences.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: Oxford Texts in Applied and Engineering Mathematics (Book 10)\nPDF: 540 pages\nPublisher: Oxford University Press; 4 edition (October 11, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0199208255\nISBN-13: 978-0199208258\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25a642dc7a9252430e95dd3fca7ddbf76b061475","amp;dn":"Nonlinear+Ordinary+Differential+Equations%3A+An+Introduction+for+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25a642dc7a9252430e95dd3fca7ddbf76b061475","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,166,66,220,122,146,82,67,14,149,221,63,202,125,219,247,107,6,20,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
