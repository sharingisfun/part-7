While the band's self-titled debut employed standard pop-metal riffs and generic lyrics (albeit to great commercial success), 1991's Slave to the Grind and 1995's Subhuman Race broke away from the pop-metal mold with uncharacteristically hard, thrashy guitars and unique songwriting techniques. Though personal differences and changing trends would eventually tear the core lineup apart by 1996, Skid Row showed tremendous promise during their short time in the spotlight.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Youth Gone Wild\n02.18 And Life\n03.Piece Of Me\n04.I Remember You\n05.The Threat\n06.Psycho Love\n07.Monkey Business\n08.Quicksand Jesus\n09.Slave To The Grind\n10.Into Another\n11.Frozen\n12.My Enemy\n13.Breakin' Down\n14.Beat Yourself Blind\n15.Forever\n16.Fire In The Hole\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d60438eb07042a6ed0c97d762df464224f71cb6","amp;dn":"Skid+Row+-+40+Seasons+Best+Of+%281998%29+%5B320+Rip%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d60438eb07042a6ed0c97d762df464224f71cb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,96,67,142,176,112,66,166,237,12,151,215,98,223,70,66,36,247,28,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
