Now you need to apply your knowledge to real life clinical situations.\n\nThe problem-solving approach of Core Clinical Cases guides you to think of the patient as a whole, rather than as a sequence of unconnected symptoms. With its emphasis on everyday practice strongly linked to underlying theory, the series integrates your knowledge with the realities of managing clinical problems, and provides a basis for developing sound analytical and confident decision-making skills. \n\nThe core areas of undergraduate study are covered in a logical sequence of learning activities: the same questions are asked of each clinical case, followed by detailed explanatory answers. Related OSCE counselling cases, with related questions and answers, also feature in each section.\n\nKey concepts and important information are highlighted, and the reader-friendly layout reflects exactly the type of question you will encounter, making these volumes the perfect revision aid for all types of case-based examination.\n\nThe Psychiatry volume, fully revised and updated in this third edition, focuses on the following topics: \n\n* Psychosis * Mood disorders * Anxiety disorders * Chronic disorders * Older people * Young people * Psychiatry in general medical settings * Substance misuse * Psychiatry and aggression\n\nVolumes in the Core Clinical Cases series remain absolutely invaluable in the run up to clinical, written or OSCE examinations, and ideal course companions for all undergraduate medical students at various stages in their clinical training.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce3fd025047edd32fdf551b12698a0d836588302","amp;dn":"Core+Clinical+Cases+in+Psychiatry%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce3fd025047edd32fdf551b12698a0d836588302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,63,208,37,4,126,221,50,253,245,81,177,38,152,160,216,54,88,131,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
