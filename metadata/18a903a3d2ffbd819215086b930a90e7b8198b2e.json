As Gogol's wily antihero, Chichikov, combs the back country wheeling and dealing for &quot;dead souls&quot; -- deceased serfs who still represent money to anyone sharp enough to trade in them -- we are introduced to a Dickensian cast of peasants, landowners, and conniving petty officials, few of whom can resist the seductive illogic of Chichikov's proposition. \n\nThis lively, idiomatic English version by the award-winning translators Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky makes accessible the full extent of the novel's lyricism, sulphurous humor, and delight in human oddity and error.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18a903a3d2ffbd819215086b930a90e7b8198b2e","amp;dn":"Nikolai+Gogol+-+Dead+Souls+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18a903a3d2ffbd819215086b930a90e7b8198b2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,169,3,163,210,255,189,129,146,21,8,107,147,10,144,231,184,25,139,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
