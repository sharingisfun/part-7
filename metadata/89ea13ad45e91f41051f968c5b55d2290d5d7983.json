It retained the Macintosh facilities and replaced the DOS version with a Windows version that included play by TCP/IP and provided Blizzard's online service, Battle.net, for multiplayer games.\n\nWarcraft II Battle.net Edition is the continuation of the ruthless clash between the armies of the noble Humans and the brutish Orcs.  From the initial, unexpected invasion of the Orcish Horde to the quest of the Great Alliance to forever seal the Dark Portal that links their two worlds, you will experience the epic saga of the mighty battle to gain dominance over the kingdom of Azeroth.  Along the way you'll need to carefully manage your limited resources to successfully construct and rule your medieval empire while engaging in real-time tactical warfare over land, sea and air.\n\nThe Warcraft Series has sold over four million copies worldwide and has won numerous awards including multiple Game of the Year and Best Multiplayer Game honors.\n\nThis is the Full, Original CD Image ISO file which can be burned to a blank CD (using included Astroburn) or mounted using including Daemon Tools.\n\nI have also included the latest game patch (War2Patch_202) which comes directly from Blizzard's Support Site:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=20978&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=20978&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand the Game Manual (in .pdf format) also from Blizzard's website.\n\nRead the Readme.txt file for Installation Instructions...\n\nEnjoy,\n\n- AAW007\n\n\nP.S.
