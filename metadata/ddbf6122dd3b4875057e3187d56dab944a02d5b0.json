Laurencin, Lakshmi S. Nair (CRC, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nNanotechnology and regenerative engineering have emerged to the forefront as the most versatile and innovative technologies to foster novel therapeutic techniques and strategies of the twenty-first century. The first edition of Nanotechnology and Tissue Engineering: The Scaffold was the first comprehensive source to explain the developments in nanostructured biomaterials for tissue engineering, the relevance of nanostructured materials in tissue regeneration, and the current applications of nanostructured scaffolds for engineering various tissues. This fully revised second edition, renamed Nanotechnology and Regenerative Engineering: The Scaffold, provides a thorough update to the existing material, bringing together these two unique areas to give a perspective of the emerging therapeutic strategies for a wide audience.\r\n\r\nNew coverage includes:\r\n\r\nUpdated discussion of the importance of scaffolds in tissue engineering\r\nExploration of cellular interactions at the nanoscale\r\nComplete range of fabrication processes capable of developing nanostructured scaffolds for regenerative engineering\r\nApplications of nanostructured scaffolds for neural, skin, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal regenerative engineering\r\nFDA approval process of nanostructure scaffolds\r\nProducts based on nanostructured scaffolds\r\nDue to the unique and tissue-mimic properties of the nanostructured scaffolds, the past five years have seen a tremendous growth in nanostructured materials for biological applications. The revised work presents the current state-of-the-art developments in nanostructured scaffolds for regenerative engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddbf6122dd3b4875057e3187d56dab944a02d5b0","amp;dn":"Nanotechnology+and+Regenerative+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddbf6122dd3b4875057e3187d56dab944a02d5b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,191,97,34,221,59,72,117,5,126,49,135,213,109,171,148,74,2,213,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
