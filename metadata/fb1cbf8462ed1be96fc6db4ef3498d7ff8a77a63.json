Today, the 41 mile line thrives as a tourism attraction, with steam hauled trains operating daily trips during the summer. \n\nA key feature of the route is its Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) signalling, which replaced semaphore signalling in 1987. The system spreads across the West Highland Line and is operated from a purpose-built signalling centre at Banavie. \n\nIncluded with the route is a new Class 37/4 diesel locomotive, featuring new exterior modelling and unique simulated power and braking performance. The mode contains a wealth of detailing, including automatically fitted snowploughs according to the season, dynamically cleared snow, animated cooling fans, operating exterior fuel tank gauges, functional cab radio and RETB CDU, instrument lighting and dimming, and even a hotplate for warming your soup! \n\nAccompanying rolling stock includes Mk1 coaches in BR blue/grey livery and Scotrail West Highland green/cream livery, Mk3 BR blue/grey livery sleeper coaches, OTA timber carriers, OAA open wagons, TTA oil tank wagons, PCA alumina wagons and YGH Ã¢â‚¬ËœSealionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ballast wagons. \n\nWith its World beating scenery and global exposure through a number of blockbuster movies, the West Highland Line Extension is a must for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb1cbf8462ed1be96fc6db4ef3498d7ff8a77a63","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+West+Highland+Line+Extension+Route","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb1cbf8462ed1be96fc6db4ef3498d7ff8a77a63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,28,191,132,98,237,27,233,111,198,219,78,243,73,141,127,248,167,122,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
