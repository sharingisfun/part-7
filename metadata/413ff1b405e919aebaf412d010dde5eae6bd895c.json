It was established by Hungarian-American publisher Joseph Pulitzer and is administered by Columbia University in New York City. According to the administrators of the Pulitzer Prize the correct pronunciation of the name should sound like the verb pull, as in &quot;Pull it, sir&quot;. Prizes are awarded yearly in twenty-one categories. In twenty of these, each winner receives a certificate and a US$10,000 cash award.[2] The winner in the public service category of the journalism competition is awarded a gold medal, which always goes to a newspaper, although an individual may be named in the citation.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:413ff1b405e919aebaf412d010dde5eae6bd895c","amp;dn":"Pulitzer+Prize+Winners+1918+to+2011+by+Various+Authors+%2854+Books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"413ff1b405e919aebaf412d010dde5eae6bd895c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,63,241,180,5,233,25,174,186,244,18,208,16,221,229,234,230,189,137,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
