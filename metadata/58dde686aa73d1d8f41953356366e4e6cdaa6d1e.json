With eleven Grammy Awards, seven Dove Awards and ten Stellar Awards, Shirley Caesar launches her own label, Shu-Bel Music in partnership with Artemis Gospel. One of gospel musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most beloved divas brings you a soul stirring, foot stomping, and church clapping CD that is sure to move both gospel and non-gospel listeners, in this live studio recording. Shirley Caesar and Tonex deliver a groundbreaking performance where traditional gospel meets hip hop with the song I Know the Truth. &quot;Working with Pastor Caesar was nothing short of amazing&quot; says Tonex of his experience recording with Shirley Caesar, &quot;People are going to be so surprised to see just how relevant she is even in the 21st century.&quot; The story songs that have become a trademark for Pastor Caesar are also captured in I KNOW THE TRUTH with songs like Jailbird and Every Day Is Like MotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Day. \n\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, September 2009\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58dde686aa73d1d8f41953356366e4e6cdaa6d1e","amp;dn":"Shirley+Caesar+-+2005+-+I+Know+The+Truth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58dde686aa73d1d8f41953356366e4e6cdaa6d1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,221,230,134,170,115,209,216,244,25,83,53,99,102,228,230,205,170,109,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
