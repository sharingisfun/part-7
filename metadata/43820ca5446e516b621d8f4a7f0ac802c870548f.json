The Piano Concerto in F sharp minor is, seriously, the most fucking beautiful piece I have ever heard. It's hardly ever played in concert halls unfortunately, but we have this recording to get us through!\nFormat is FLAC. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43820ca5446e516b621d8f4a7f0ac802c870548f","amp;dn":"Scriabin%2C+Alexander+-+Le+Poeme+de+l%5C%27extase%2C+Prometheus%2C+Concert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43820ca5446e516b621d8f4a7f0ac802c870548f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,130,12,165,68,110,81,107,98,29,143,74,127,10,200,2,200,112,84,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
