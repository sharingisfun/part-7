Once we have the basic ideas of drawing and editing Roto shapes, we learn how to animate the rotoscopes to get the full picture of how these powerful masks can be implemented into your NUKE workflow. \n\nAfter we've practiced with animating the shapes, we move onto some more complex situations you may encounter when rotoscoping, and also some tips to help you save time during this sometimes repetitive process. We finish out by learning how to use a rotoscope with another piece of footage and how to output the rotoscope as an alpha channel to be used later or to speed up your workflow. \n\nThis training is for you if you are ready to learn one of the most valuable compositing techniques and master a skill that every NUKE user has to know. By the end of this tutorial, you will be familiar with the best ways to draw rotoscopes for fast animation, and be ready to use a rotoscope with other footage in any project you want to tackle.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dump.bz/storage1/0713/o2ILE9l58Y5ZWfJ894kFpGyRrL0KKIO9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dump.bz/storage1/0713/o2ILE9l58Y5ZWfJ894kFpGyRrL0KKIO9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fd7349bbfb605bf9247bbb923131952c0254587","amp;dn":"Digital-Tutors+-+Your+First+Day+of+Rotoscoping+in+NUKE+HD+720p+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fd7349bbfb605bf9247bbb923131952c0254587","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,215,52,155,191,182,5,191,146,71,187,185,35,19,25,82,192,37,69,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
