But even though he only contributed one original, the touching &quot;Ladder of Success,&quot; to the set, Hawkins wasn't content to remain in one genre, his commanding revival of Webb Pierce's hillbilly weeper &quot;There Stands the Glass&quot; ranks with the disc's very best moments (of which there are many).
