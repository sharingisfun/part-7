To date, no graphical version of IDA for Linux has has been leaked, prompting me to get my own copy. The evaluation version is a little buggy and we don't get that nifty decompiler, but most of the functionally was restored making for a fairly competent disassembler/debugger.\n\n-Completely replaced the code that loads the loader modules, removing the PE/ELF/Mach-O limitation.\n-Removed the check restricting which processor modules are allowed.\n-Created a custum loader to re-enable support for loading Binary files.\n-Removed the experation check.\n-Removed the nags when opening and closing projects.\n-Disabled the thread that would open a nag after some time. In the past it would force the program to close, but I guess that was broken in the transition to QT.\n-Removed the checks preventing self-disassembly.\n-Removed a limitation preventing large large amounts of data from being copied to the clipboard.\n-Some options were removed from the Help menu for cosmetics.\n\nNo database saving or loading, so you will have to use IDC files to save your work.\n\nPics:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kajjfAAek&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kajjfAAek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KAjjiAaeK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KAjjiAaeK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KajjhAAEk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KajjhAAEk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86d4e46cc20e22c6064c7c908fff98d08cf9ea4e","amp;dn":"Hex-Rays+IDA+6.3+Linux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86d4e46cc20e22c6064c7c908fff98d08cf9ea4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,212,228,108,194,14,34,198,6,76,124,144,143,255,152,208,140,249,234,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
