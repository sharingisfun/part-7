They pump millions of dollars into these events, hoping to find new customers, strengthen their brand, and meet new partners. Sadly, for most of them, things donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go that way. Submitted topics arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t chosen; when they are, they come across as tone-deaf sales pitches.\n\nWhat does it take to be chosen to speakÃ¢â‚¬â€and to rock the mic when given the chance? This book takes you behind-the-scenes of the conference process, showing you how to submit, plan, and deliver a talk that matters. Event organizer Alistair Croll provides many examples based on his experience with a wide range of conferences, including OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Strata, Velocity, Web2Expo, and TOC Conferences.\n\nLearn 11 items that help your submission stand outÃ¢â‚¬â€and 11 items that will get it tossed\nExplore the hurdles your proposal has to clear before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accepted\nTailor your talk to a conferenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s topics and themes\nDiscover why images work better than words in your slide deck\nAchieve your business goals by engaging the audience before, during, and after your talk\n\n&quot;WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been running successful events worldwide for over a decade, and the simple truth is that the people who get chosen, and give great presentations, follow the rules in this book.&quot;\n\n--Gina Blaber, VP Conferences, OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly Media\nAbout the Author\n\nAlistair Croll has been an entrepreneur, author, and public speaker for nearly 20 years. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worked on a variety of topics, from web performance, to big data, to cloud computing, to startups, in that time.\n\nIn 2001, he co-founded web performance startup Coradiant, and since that time has also launched Rednod, CloudOps, Bitcurrent, Year One Labs, the Bitnorth conference, the International Startup Festival and several other early-stage companies.\n\nAlistair is the author of three books on web performance, analytics, and IT operations, and is currently working on Lean Analytics, a book on using data to build a better business faster that's due out in March from O'Reilly Media. He lives in Montreal, Canada and tries to mitigate chronic ADD by writing about far too many things at Solve For Interesting. Alistair chairs O'Reilly's Strata Conference.\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a058dd7639b0a6e01346bd8fc43fc70af400c0db","amp;dn":"Propose%2C+Prepare%2C+Present%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a058dd7639b0a6e01346bd8fc43fc70af400c0db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,88,221,118,57,176,166,224,19,70,189,143,196,63,199,10,244,0,192,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
