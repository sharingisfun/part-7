They represented an 'army' of hard physical men who were capable of enduring tough labour for long hours. Many roved the countryside looking for work and a better deal. They gained a reputation as troublesome outsiders, fond of drinking and living a life of ungodly debauchery. But who were they? Unreliable heathens and outcasts, or unsung heroes who used might and muscle to build canals and railways? We focus on the Manchester Ship Canal - the swansong for the navvies and hailed as the greatest engineering feat of the Victorian Age. The navvies worked at a time of rising trade unionism. But could they organise and campaign for a better deal?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen0.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen1.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen2.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen3.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen4.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c8/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen5.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/30/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen6.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen7.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a6/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen8.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen9.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/95/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen10.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cd/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3073 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 29mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 657 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information  \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0689qmh","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b26131bf7b84d9bdd500966992c36186d983d7d","amp;dn":"Canals.The.Making.Of.A.Nation.4of6.The.Workers.720p.HDTV.x264.AA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b26131bf7b84d9bdd500966992c36186d983d7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,38,19,27,247,184,77,155,221,80,9,102,153,44,54,24,109,152,61,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
