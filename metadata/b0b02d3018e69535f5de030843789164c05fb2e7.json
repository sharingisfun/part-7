Abrahart and Linda M. See\nCRC Press | June 2014 | ISBN-10: 1466503289 | PDF | 475 pages | 22.7 mb\n\nA revision of Openshaw and AbrahartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seminal work, GeoComputation, Second Edition retains influences of its originators while also providing updated, state-of-the-art information on changes in the computational environment. In keeping with the fieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development, this new edition takes a broader view and provides comprehensive coverage across the field of GeoComputation.\nSee WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New in the Second Edition:\n-  Coverage of ubiquitous computing, the GeoWeb, reproducible research, open access, and agent-based modelling\n-  Expanded chapter on Genetic Programming and a separate chapter developed on Evolutionary Algorithms\n-  Ten chapters updated by the same or new authors and eight new chapters added to reflect state of the art\n\nEach chapter is a stand-alone entity that covers a particular topic. You can simply dip in and out or read it from cover to cover. The opening chapter by Stan Openshaw has been preserved, with only a limited number of minor essential modifications having been enacted. This is not just a matter of respect. OpenshawÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work is eloquent, prophetic, and his overall message remains largely unchanged.\nIn contrast to other books on this subject, GeoComputation: Second Edition supplies a state-of-the-art review of all major areas in GeoComputation with chapters written especially for this book by invited specialists. This approach helps develop and expand a computational culture, one that can exploit the ever-increasing richness of modern geographical and geospatial datasets. It also supplies an instructional guide to be kept within easy reach for regular access and when need arises. \n\nAbout the Authors\nDr. Robert J. Abrahart is an associate professor of geographical information science in the School of Geography at the University of Nottingham, UK. He is a computational geographer with specialist interests in neural network modeling and hydroinformatics.\nDr. Linda M. See is a research scholar in the Ecosystems Services Management Program at the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. Her research interests include the application of artificial intelligence and computational geography to a range of geographical problems in the human and physical domains.\n\nContents\nForeword ....vii\nPreface by Robert J.
