The Bible identifies this personality as the Antichrist. But now things were making sense to Thomas Ã¢â‚¬â€œ world affairs, changes to U.S. domestic and foreign policy, a renewed focus on the Middle East, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Babylon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and he found it astonishing. The words, deeds, gestures and coded language of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful men were clearly pointing to an ancient, prophetic, cryptic and even terrifying reality. What even the best researchers of the Illuminati and veiled fraternities such as the Freemasons were never able to fully decipher is spelled out herein for the first time. The power at work behind global affairs and why current planetary powers are hurriedly aligning for a New Order from Chaos is exposed. Perhaps most incredibly, one learns how ancient prophets actually foresaw and forewarned of this time. Thomas believes this New World Order is very near.\n\n-Forbidden Gates &amp; Teachers Guide:\nWhile Forbidden Gates includes fresh insights for traditional, tried and true methods of overcoming darkness, it also unveils for the first time how breakthrough advances in science, technology, and philosophyÃ¢â‚¬â€including cybernetics, bio-engineering, nanotechnology, machine intelligence, synthetic biology, and transhumanismÃ¢â‚¬â€will combine to create mind-boggling game-changes to everything you have ever known about spiritual warfare.\nHow so? In recent years, astonishing technological developments have pushed the frontiers of humanity toward far-reaching morphological transformation that promises in the very near future to redefine what it means to be human. An international, intellectual and fast-growing cultural movement known as transhumanism intends the use of genetics, robotics, artificial intelligence and nanotechnology (GRIN technologies) as tools that will radically redesign our minds, our memories, our physiology, our offspring, and even perhaps, as Joel Garreau in his bestselling book Radical Evolution claims, our very souls. The technological, cultural, and metaphysical shift now under way unapologetically forecasts a future dominated by this new species of unrecognizably superior humans, and applications under study now to make this dream reality are being funded by thousands of government and private research facilities around the world. As the reader will learn, this includes among other things rewriting human DNA and combining men with beasts, a fact that some university studies and transhumanists believe will not only alter our bodies and souls but could ultimately open a door to contact with unseen intelligence.\nAs a result, new modes of perception between things visible and invisible are expected to challenge the Church in ways that are historically and theologically unprecedented. Without comprehending what is quickly approaching in related disciplines of research and development, vast numbers of believers could be paralyzed by the most fantasticÃ¢â‚¬â€and most far reachingÃ¢â‚¬â€supernatural implications. The destiny of each individualÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as the future of their familyÃ¢â‚¬â€will depend on their knowledge of the new paradigm and their preparedness to face it head on.\n\n-Nephilim Stargates:\nOne myth from the history of every great civilization spoke of beings descending from heaven and using human and animal DNA to create giant offspring. Rabbinical authorities, Septuagint translators and early church fathers understood this as a factual record of history. The phenomenon began with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“WatchersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who spawned Ã¢â‚¬Å“NephilimÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ resulting in judgment from God. The ancients also knew Bible passages that predict the Nephilim will return when Iraq and Iran are invaded and destroyed. Is this prophecy about to be fulfilled? Is man, in his rush to play god through biological weapons, biotechnology, and genetic manipulation, opening gateways to a supernatural unknown? Nephilim Stargates and the Return of the Watchers is a glimpse into this past, present, and future phenomena, with an eye on what sages and scientists believe and what futurists and prophets may fear.\n\n-Spiritual Warfare: The Invisible Invasion:\nSince the 1930's, the values promoted by the liberal left have changed our country dramatically. The highest courts in the land have ruled with contemptuous decree against God, morality, and the free expression of religion, while Hollywood has denigrated the traditional family and mocked moral virtue. The results of this cultural upheaval are clear: the United States has become the most profane and morally corrupt society in the industrialized world. Thomas Horn's research reveals how the unseen activity of demons is at work in social policy today and he prescribes the solution. Covers the hottest topics in Christianity today including archeology, UFOs, angels, and spiritual warfare.\n\n-Stargates:\nAncient Rituals, and Those Invited Through The Portal\n\n-The Gods Who Walk Among Us:\nAuthors Thomas Horn &amp; Donald C. Jones (Professor of Biblical history) make the startling claim that Zeus, Apollo, Athena, Diana, and other mythological deities are alive and well on planet earth! The authors point to biblical predictions of an end time revival of paganism and warn of increasing idolatry, which will lead to Armageddon. In reporting on this explosive issue, Horn and Jones warn that humanity is moving toward paganism's ultimate incarnation - the god-king or Antichrist of the New World Order. \n\n\n\nTom Horn is an internationally recognized lecturer, radio host and best selling author of several books including his newest books, Petrus Romanus: The Final Pope Is Here, Forbidden Gates and Apollyon Rising 2012. He is a well-known columnist whose articles have been referred to by writers of the L. A. Times Syndicate, MSNBC, Christianity Today, New Man Magazine, World Net Daily, News Max, White House Correspondents and dozens of newsmagazines and press agencies around the globe. He has been interviewed by US Congressmen and Senators on his findings as well as featured repeatedly in major media including top-ten talk shows, America's Morning News for The Washington Times, The 700 Club, The Harvest Show, Coast to Coast AM, Prophecy in the News, and the Southwest Radio Church to name a few. Thomas received the highest degree honorary doctorate bestowed in 2007 from legendary professor Dr. I.D.E. Thomas for his research into ancient history, and has been endorsed by such national leaders as Dr. James Kennedy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ec5a721e439446814cb7a12835a9b2c26f3b39e","amp;dn":"Tom+Horn+Books+-+Stargates%2C+Nephilim%2C+Antichrist%2C+Transhumanism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ec5a721e439446814cb7a12835a9b2c26f3b39e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,197,167,33,228,57,68,104,20,203,122,18,131,90,155,44,38,243,179,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
