But that's going to change now that she's taken over her late grandmother's matchmaking business. All Annabelle has to do is land the Windy City's hottest bachelor as her client, and she'll be the most sought-after matchmaker in town.\n\nWhy does the wealthy, driven, and gorgeous sports agent Heath Champion need a matchmaker, especially a red-haired screw-up like Annabelle Granger? True, she's entertaining, and she does have a certain quirky appeal. But Heath is searching for the ultimate symbol of success -- the perfect wife. And to make an extraordinary match, he needs an extraordinary matchmaker, right?\n\nSoon everyone in Chicago has a stake in the outcome, and a very big question: When the determined matchmaker promised she'd do anything to keep her star client happy . . . did she mean anything? If Annabelle isn't careful, she just might find herself going heart-to-heart with the toughest negotiator in town.\n\nAudio Cassette\nPublisher: Sound Library; Unabridged edition (August 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0792736176\nISBN-13: 978-0792736172\n\nWritten by Susan Elizabeth Phillips \nRead by Anna Fields \nFormat: M4A \nBitrate: 64Kbps \nUnabridged \n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
