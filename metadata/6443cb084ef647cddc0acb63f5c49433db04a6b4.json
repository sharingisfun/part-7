Formed in a suburb of Stockholm in 2005 and comprised of Rebecka Rolfart, Cissi Efraimsson, Lisa Pyk Wirstrom, Mimmi Evrell, and Linea Jonsson, the group made waves among Swedish indie pop connoisseurs thanks to a handful of synthy, handclappy demos posted on its MySpace site. Armed with a sweet-as-pie indie pop sound that nodded to the Acid House Kings, the Concretes, and the Besties, Those Dancing Days found success abroad and at home in 2007; they were featured as a Spin.com Artist of the Day, and they even won a spot to compete on the Swedish song contest TV show Grand Prix. V2 Music signed them that year, and the band's self-titled debut EP hit stores in late August. Their debut full-length studio album, In Our Space Hero Suits, appeared in 2009. In 2011 Those Dancing Days returned with the more polished '80s dance-rock and post-punk-influenced Daydreams &amp; Nightmares. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tAlternative\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Reaching Forward\n02.I'll Be Yours\n03.Dream About Me\n04.Help Me Close My Eyes\n05.Can't Find Entrance\n06.Fuckarias\n07.Forest Of Love\n08.When We Fade Away\n09.Keep Me In Your Pocket\n10.I Know Where You Live Pt. 2\n11.One Day Forever\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n               ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6443cb084ef647cddc0acb63f5c49433db04a6b4","amp;dn":"Those+Dancing+Days-Daydreams+%26+Nightmares+%282011%29+MP3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6443cb084ef647cddc0acb63f5c49433db04a6b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,67,203,8,78,246,71,205,220,10,203,99,245,196,148,51,219,4,166,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
