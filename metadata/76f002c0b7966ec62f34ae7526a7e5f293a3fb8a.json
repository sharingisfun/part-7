His work Symphony No. 3, Op. 36 'Symphony of Sorrowful Songs' (1976), is his best known work, and one of the most moving works ever written. Please listen to this and share in his legacy. No doubt this will be filling out concert halls all over the world within the next few years, so please support the Gorecki family and legacy and attend, you will be glad you did.\n\nAlso included on this CD rip is '3 Olden Style Pieces' (1963), which is a beautiful ode to Polish folk music.\n\nFormat is in FLAC. Please enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76f002c0b7966ec62f34ae7526a7e5f293a3fb8a","amp;dn":"Gorecki%2C+Henryk+%281933-2010%29+-+Symphony+No.+3+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76f002c0b7966ec62f34ae7526a7e5f293a3fb8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,240,2,192,183,150,110,198,47,52,174,117,38,167,229,242,147,163,251,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
