In his understated way, Taylor is cool. He&amp;#039;s a master of the stage, studio and whatever solitary place he visits when he writes his songs. A highlight of the taping came from Natalie Maines&amp;#039; dazzling rendition of Taylor&amp;#039;s &quot;Sweet Baby James,&quot; a lovely example of how\npop songs and a country voice can intersect gracefully.\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n?
