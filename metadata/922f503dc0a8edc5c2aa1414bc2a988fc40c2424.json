In this story of family, loyalty, and the men who rule the American underworld, Puzo introduced a cast of singularly crafted characters, and offered an unforgettable look into the world of organized crime no writer has been able to duplicate since.\n\n\nPuzo\\\\\\&amp;#039;s story details the rise of Don Vito Corleone, the fall of his sons Sonny and, especially, Michael, the Mafia\\\\\\&amp;#039;s peculiar behavior code and honor system, and the violent power struggle among rival \\\\\\&quot;families.\\\\\\&quot; To some reviewers, Puzo\\\\\\&amp;#039;s tale is a symbolic treatment of the corruption of the American dream. Although not all critics view the novel so seriously, most agree with Polly Anderson in the Library Journal that \\\\\\&quot;the book is well written, suspenseful and explodes in a series of dramatic climaxes.\\\\\\&quot; Newsweek\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Pete Axthelm calls Puzo \\\\\\&quot;an extremely talented storyteller\\\\\\&quot; and states that The Godfather \\\\\\&quot;moves at breakneck speed without ever losing its balance.\\\\\\&quot; And a critic for the Saturday Review contends that \\\\\\&quot;Mario Puzo has achieved the definitive novel about a sinister fraternity of crime.\\\\\\&quot;\n\n \n             ****************************************************\n\nIf you like audio books please buy some.
