I have gathered these from the net and the manufacturers. These are only for use within the context of FCC regulations and licensing. This software allows you to program your radios yourself instead of paying someone else to do it. If you are not familiar with offsets, CTCSS, DCS, and bandwidth, please have someone knowledgeable do the programming until you learn about these and other aspects of transceiver set-up. Do not program your radio for frequencies outside of your license and radio service. General class and higher ham radio operators should have no problems with using any of this software to program their radios.\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37c19cd8a3efd1c7f8cbda0e4ea67d6a2234c50b","amp;dn":"Commercial+%26+Ham+Radio+Programming+Software","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37c19cd8a3efd1c7f8cbda0e4ea67d6a2234c50b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,193,156,216,163,239,209,199,248,203,218,14,78,166,125,106,34,52,197,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
