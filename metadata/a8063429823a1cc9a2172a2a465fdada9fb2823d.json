For more information on Richie read about him on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Kotzen\n\nThis is pretty much his biggest discography that's ever been shared before.  Just about most of his main work is included, lots of Solo albums plus also some of his guitar work with Poison and Mr. Big and another Jazz Fusion band he played on an album called Vertu.  This is a great selection of Richie's work on guitar and also as a singer, writer and performer.  Bearing in mind also he can play many different instruments including guitar, piano, bass, drums and also sings very good, he is multi talented.  I saw Richie playing live just last month gone, he is an awesome guitarist and plays such great things, makes it look easy he does but of course he has played for years and years, since the 1980s when he was very young.  \n\nAnyway check his music out, worth looking at.  I have fully tagged all of these with album arkwork included.  All mp3s are at the same quality at 320kbps CBR 44.1 Khz.\n\nIf you like his music then please leave a comment, would be good to hear from anybody who is already a fan of Richie's.  All I can say is I was really pleased to see him perform live on his current tour, what a great guy and multi talented musician.\n\nHere is the album listing as follows:\n\n1989 - Richie Kotzen - Richie Kotzen\n\n01 - Squeeze Play\n02 - Strut It\n03 - Unsafe At Any Speed\n04 - Rat Trap\n05 - Cryptic Script\n06 - Plaid Plesiosaur\n07 - Spider Legs\n08 - Jocose Jenny\n09 - Noblesse Oblige\n\n1990 - Richie Kotzen - Fever Dream\n\n01 - She\n02 - Fall Of A Leader\n03 - Off The Rails\n04 - Yvonne\n05 - Things Remembered Never Die\n06 - Dream Of A New Day\n07 - Money Power\n08 - Rollercoaster\n09 - Wheels Can Fly\n10 - Truth In Lies\n\n1991 - Richie Kotzen - Electric Joy\n\n01 - B Funk\n02 - Electric Toy\n03 - Shufina\n04 - Acid Lips\n05 - Slow Blues\n06 - High Wire\n07 - Dr. Glee\n08 - Hot Rails\n09 - The Deece Song\n\n1993 - Poison - Native Tongue\n\n01 - Native Tongue\n02 - The Scream\n03 - Stand\n04 - Stay Alive\n05 - Until You Suffer Some (Fire And Ice)\n06 - Body Talk\n07 - Bring It Home\n08 - 7 Days Over You\n09 - Richie's Acoustic Thang\n10 - Ain't That The Truth\n11 - Theatre Of The Soul\n12 - Strike Up The Band\n13 - Ride Child Ride\n14 - Blind Faith\n15 - Bastard Son Of A Thousand Blues\n\n1994 - Richie Kotzen - Mother Head's Family Reunion\n\n01 - Socialite\n02 - Mother Head's Family Reunion\n03 - Where Did Our Love Go\n04 - Natural Thing\n05 - A Love Divine\n06 - Soul To Soul\n07 - Reach Out I'll Be There\n08 - Testify\n09 - Used\n10 - A Woman &amp;
