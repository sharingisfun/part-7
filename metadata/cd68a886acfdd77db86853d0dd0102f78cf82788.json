With two veterans of the Savuka days (Andy Innes and Mandisa Dlanga) and the new talent Johnny has recruited for this band, the musicianship is superb, the arrangements are new and lively and in a few cases even better than the originals. The liner notes explain that this is a live recording of performances made at the Nelson Theatre in Johannesburg called &quot;A South African Story.&quot; Tens (hundreds?) of thousands of South Africans have attended these concerts over the past few years. If you saw the band in the US in Spring or Summer 2004 and want to listen to the sound you heard, this is the CD to buy. If you already know Clegg&amp;#039;s music, this is an excellent way to get updated on a master musician&amp;#039;s newest phase. Hopefully it will be released domestically and will be a little less expensive, but it is still worth every penny!\n\n\n\n\n1. Bullets for Bafazana ()\n2. I Call Your Name ()\n3. Giyani ()\n4.
