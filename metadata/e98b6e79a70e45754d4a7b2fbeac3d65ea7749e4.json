While the band did record original material, they were best known for their loud, heavy, slowed-down arrangements of contemporary pop songs, blowing them up to epic proportions and bathing them in a trippy, distorted haze. Originally, Vanilla Fudge was a blue-eyed soul cover band called the Electric Pigeons, who formed on Long Island, NY, in 1965. Organist Mark Stein, bassist Tim Bogert, and drummer Joey Brennan soon shortened their name to the Pigeons and added guitarist Vince Martell. They built a following by gigging extensively up and down the East Coast, and earned extra money by providing freelance in-concert backing for girl groups. In early 1966, the group recorded a set of eight demos that were released several years later as While the Whole World Was Eating Vanilla Fudge, credited to Mark Stein &amp; the Pigeons.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.All In Your Mind\n02.Take Me For A Little While\n03.Ticket To Ride\n04.People Get Ready\n05.She's Not There\n06.You Keep Me Hanging On\n07.Where Is My Mind\n08.The Look Of Love\n09.Sketch\n10.The Beat Goes On\n11.Come By Day, Come By Night\n12.The Sky Cried - When I Was A  Boy\n13.That's What Makes A  Man\n14.Faceless People\n15.Season Of The Witch\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\n01.Shotgun\n02.Some Velvet Morning\n03.You Can't Do That\n04.People\n05.Good Good Livin' (Long Version)\n06.Heartache Jam\n07.Need Love\n08.Lord In The Country\n09.Street Walking Woman\n10.The Windmills Of Your Mind\n11.Jealousy\n12.My World Is Empty\n\n\nDisc 3\n\n\n01.She's Not There (Live)\n02.Shotgun (Live)\n03.People Get Ready (Live)\n04.You Keep Me Hanging On (Live)\n05.Season Of The Witch (Live)\n06.Break Song (Live)\n\n\nDisc 4\n\n\n01.Good Good Livin' (Live)\n02.Ticket To Ride (Live)\n03.Medley: Moonlight Sonata/FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼r Elise/Eleanor Rigby (Live)\n04.Take Me For A Little While (Live)\n05.Like A Rolling Stone (Live)\n06.Love Jam\n07.Movin' On\n08.Vf Studio Jam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e98b6e79a70e45754d4a7b2fbeac3d65ea7749e4","amp;dn":"Vanilla+Fudge+-+Box+Of+Fudge+4CD+%282010%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e98b6e79a70e45754d4a7b2fbeac3d65ea7749e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,139,110,121,167,14,69,117,77,74,123,47,190,172,61,101,234,119,73,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
