The album reached #166 on the Billboard 200 album chart and received extremely favorable reviews. According to Allmusic, &quot;Throughout Son Volt's debut, Trace, the group reworks classic honky tonk and rock &amp; roll, adding a desperate, determined edge to their performances. Even when they rock out, there is a palpable sense of melancholy to Farrar's voice, which lends a poignancy to the music.&quot; The album was in the top 10 of Rolling Stone's 1995 critics' list.\n\n&quot;Drown&quot; was a minor college and rock radio hit. It charted at #10 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and #25 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. It remains their only single to chart on either of the charts.\n\nAll of the songs were written by Farrar except &quot;Mystifies Me,&quot; which is a cover of a Ronnie Wood song.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57f5d771c0788b7f1fc3efc1084bc82eee054858","amp;dn":"Son+Volt+-+%5C%27Trace%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57f5d771c0788b7f1fc3efc1084bc82eee054858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,245,215,113,192,120,139,127,31,195,239,193,8,75,200,46,238,5,72,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
