We pulled together a massive team of theater pros at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Opera House Ã¢â‚¬â€œ nearly 50 singers, actors, dancers and musicians. The result? Journalism turned into a Broadway musical, into opera. Mike Birbiglia, Sasheer Zamata, Stephin Merritt, Lindsay Mendez, Josh Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda and others.&quot;\n\nThe show was released on their website as a free podcast, and a $5 video, but DRM on that video makes it difficult to download over unreliable connections, and impossible to stream over slow ones. \n\nSo here it is, unaltered in 720p, over the fastest, most reliable, and most equitable distribution system yet invented. If you like what you see, consider supporting This American Life on their website at thisamericanlife.org. They can't do shows like this without your support.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b0b2bc29f809f2bcd7238f7042374615ddd6d30","amp;dn":"This+American+Life+-+Live+at+BAM+%28720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b0b2bc29f809f2bcd7238f7042374615ddd6d30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,11,43,194,159,128,159,43,205,114,56,247,4,35,116,97,93,221,109,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
