She is a singer's singer who has influenced countless other vocalists ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½ female and male.\nMusic historians cite Whitney's record-setting achievements: the only artist to chart seven consecutive #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits (&quot;Saving All My Love For You,&quot; &quot;How Will I Know,&quot; &quot;Greatest Love Of All,&quot; &quot;I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me),&quot; &quot;Didn't We Almost Have It All,&quot; &quot;So Emotional,&quot; and &quot;Where Do Broken Hearts Go&quot;); the first female artist to enter the Billboard 200 album chart at #1 (her second album, Whitney, 1987); and the only artist with seven consecutive multi-platinum albums (Whitney Houston, Whitney, I'm Your Baby Tonight, The Bodyguard, Waiting To Exhale, and The Preacher's Wife soundtracks, and My Love Is Your Love).\n\nIn fact, The Bodyguard soundtrack is one of the top 10 biggest-selling albums of all-time (at 17x-platinum in the U.S. alone), and Whitney's career-defining version of Dolly Parton's &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; is the biggest-selling U.S. single of all-time (at 4x-platinum).\nIn 1983, near the end of Arista's first mega-successful decade of operation, Clive Davis was taken to a New York nightclub where Whitney was performing ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½ and signed her on the spot. Two years went into the making of her debut album, but the results were worth it. The self-titled Whitney Houston (March 1985) launched Arista's second decade, and yielded a string of hits including &quot;You Give Good Love&quot; and three consecutive #1 singles, the Grammy-winning &quot;Saving All My Love For You,&quot; &quot;How Will I Know,&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Love of All,&quot; which has become a veritable anthem. Not only did the album establish her as an important new recording artist, but it went on to sell over 12 million copies in the U.S., plus many millions more abroad. This LP set the record as the biggest selling debut album by a solo artist.\n\nWith the highly anticipated release of her second album Whitney (June 1987), she made history as the first female artist to enter the Billboard album charts at #1. The new album soared past 9x-platinum on the strength of four #1 chart-toppers, the Grammy-winning &quot;I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me),&quot; &quot;Didn't We Almost Have It All,&quot; &quot;So Emotional,&quot; and &quot;Where Do Broken Hearts Go.&quot; This established Whitney as the only artist ever to have seven consecutive #1 hits, surpassing a record previously set by the Beatles and the Bee Gees.\n\nWhitney's third best-selling album I'm Your Baby Tonight (November 1990), displayed her versatility on a new batch of tough rhythmic grooves, soulful ballads and up-tempo dance tracks. With back-to-back #1 hits for the title tune and &quot;All the Man That I Need,&quot; followed by &quot;Miracle&quot; and &quot;My Name Is Not Susan,&quot; sales records were set once again, as the album became an international multi-platinum best-seller, to the tune of 8 million copies worldwide.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=97572&amp;pid=716166#pid716166&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=97572&amp;pid=716166#pid716166&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n+-------------+\n| DiSCOGRAPHY |\n+=============+\n\nWhitney Houston (1985)\nWhitney (1987)\nI'm Your Baby Tonight (1990)\nMy Love Is Your Love (1998)\nJust Whitney (2002)\nI Look To You (2009)\n\n\nWhitney - The Greatest Hits (2000)\n\n\n\n\n+==========+\n| SETTiNGS |\n+==========+\n\nArtist.............: Whitney Houston (Whitney Elizabeth Houston)\nBorn...............: August 09, 1963 in Newark, NJ\nYear's Active......: 1977 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2012 ('80s, '90s, '00s, '10s)\nCountry............: USA\nGenre..............: R&amp;B\nQuality............: 320kbps / 44.100 kHz / v2.3 / LAME3.99\nAlbum Cover Size...: 600x600\n\n\n\n+==============+\n| ALBUM COVERS |\n+==============+\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rvC0d.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rvC0d.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/EpAZx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/EpAZx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/daxHv.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/daxHv.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wbBh9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wbBh9.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tHgDc.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tHgDc.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dIUCL.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dIUCL.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rRaAl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rRaAl.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n+=======+\n| NOTES |\n+=======+\n\nR.I.P Whitney Houston\n\nYou may be gone but you are not forgotten.\n1963 - 2012\n\nWhitney: The Greatest Hits is the American Edition.\n\n\n\n\n+=====+\n| NFO |\n+=====+\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NLmqT.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NLmqT.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:573c4a5dc652d87dac862485f9748893902122fb","amp;dn":"Whitney+Houston+Discography+%5BCD-Rip%5D%5B1985-2009%5D%5BtheLEAK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"573c4a5dc652d87dac862485f9748893902122fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,60,74,93,198,82,216,125,172,134,36,133,249,116,136,147,144,33,34,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
