The result is a low-key, joyous run-through of mostly traditional, blues-based songs with a handful of originals. Despite the high-profile presence of Knopfler, the Notting Hillbillies succeed in sounding like a band with Knopfler often taking a backseat to his bandmates, although he does sing lead on the lovely &quot;Your Own Sweet Way.&quot; The styles range from the gorgeous harmonies of &quot;Railroad Worksong&quot; with some mournful guitar from Knopfler, to the '50s-style rock ballad &quot;Bewildered,&quot; to the breezy, tropical-flavored &quot;One Way Gal.&quot; Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time is a delightful record that doesn't overstay its welcome.\nAll Music Review by Tom Demalon\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Railboard Worksong\n[02] Bewildered\n[03] Your Own Sweet Way\n[04] Run Me Down\n[05] One Way Gal\n[06] Blues Stay Away From Me\n[07] Will You Miss Me\n[08] Please Baby\n[09] Weapon Of Prayer\n[10] That's Where I Belong\n[11] Feel Like Going Home\n\nPlay Time - 00h:40m:39s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 103mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
