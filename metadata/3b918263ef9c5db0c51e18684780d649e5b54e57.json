He considers the why, the what, the how and the where of garden design by tracing the development of gardens through history and across social, political and philosophical boundaries. Fully illustrated throughout, each chapter critically examines a particular type of garden both as part of a wider socio-political context and as an aesthetic entity, asking how the design of each garden reflects the philosophical approach of its creator. Inspirational, reflective and informative, this book brings together knowledge and understanding from a diverse range of related interests to add depth and breadth to a fascinating subject.
