The most powerful plants--those known to transport the human mind into other dimensions of consciousness--have traditionally been regarded as sacred. In The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants Christian RÃ¤Â´Â³ch details the botany, history, distribution, cultivation, and preparation and dosage of more than 400 psychoactive plants. He discusses their ritual and medicinal usage, cultural artifacts made from these plants, and works of art that either represent or have been inspired by them. The author begins with 168 of the most well-known psychoactives--such as cannabis, datura, and papaver--then presents 133 lesser known substances as well as additional plants known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“legal highs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ plants known only from mythological contexts and literature, and plant products that include substances such as ayahuasca, incense, and soma. The text is lavishly illustrated with 797 color photographs--many of which are from the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extensive fieldwork around the world--showing the people, ceremonies, and art related to the ritual use of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sacred psychoactives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a500747a51b7fc5d8ba5fcbed60f49e6675404ff","amp;dn":"The+Encyclopedia+of+Psychoactive+Plants+by+Christian+Ratsch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a500747a51b7fc5d8ba5fcbed60f49e6675404ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,0,116,122,81,183,252,93,139,165,252,190,214,15,73,230,103,84,4,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
