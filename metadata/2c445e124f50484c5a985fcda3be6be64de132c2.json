The recording features both \nstudio and live tracks, which are interspersed with one another throughout the album. It is \nperhaps the group's most popular live album, because Lotus did not receive a U.S. domestic \nrelease until the early 1990s. It displays a mix between the fusion of Latin and blues-rock \nstyles of the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the much more experimental and spiritual jazz \nfusion sound that characterized the band's mid-1970s work. The live material was recorded \nduring the supporting tour for the Festival album, which displayed a similar mix of styles, \nand many of the album's songs are featured here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ namely, the three song medley which opens \nFestival.\n\nA cover version of the Zombies' mid-1960s hit song &quot;She's Not There&quot; was released as a single \nand peaked at #27. The song was the first Santana recording to hit the Top 40 of the Billboard \ncharts since &quot;No One to Depend On&quot; reached #36 in 1972. The album reached #10 on the Billboard \ncharts and was eventually certified platinum, neither of which occurred again until the \nstar-studded Supernatural in 1999.\n\n\n   1.
