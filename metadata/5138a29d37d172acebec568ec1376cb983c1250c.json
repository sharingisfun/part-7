Craft your beats with monolithic drums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 52 kits of exclusive sample content. Then add dark, grungy synths with new MASSIVE presets and overdriven breaks that hold a vice-like grip on everyone in earshot. GOLDEN KINGDOM gives you a solid-gold seat amongst the megastars of contemporary hip hop.\n\nORIGINS OF GREATNESS\n\nGOLDEN KINGDOM blends the spirit of southern hip hop with the expansive depth of cinematic drums and a dose of EDMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifting energy. Inside youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find traces of trap programming, dirty breaks, and raw, in-your-face synths Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the key elements of each genre combined to create a stylistic hybrid. The result is a bold, undeniable sound that stepped onto the world stage with authority.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTE:\nInhale oxygen and then proceed to read this note.\n\nWe are sick of the blood sucking leechers and ungrateful people that run around the forums:\nWho thinks that we are floating on top of golden mountains.\n\nThere is no such thing. \nFrom now on YOU WANT something BUY IT and SUPPLY!\n\nHow to supply?\nSimple in this release we have included the R2R tools this is how YOU can reach us!\n\nWe are NO MORE unless YOU show us why we should keep doing what we do!\n\nPS.\nA little side note.. \n\nWe would like to !welcome TEAM PHOTONE in the race of who can make most dupe/lame releases in a day.
