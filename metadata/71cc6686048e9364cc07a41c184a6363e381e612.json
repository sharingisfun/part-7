His team includes Calleigh Dusquene, a bilingual Southern beauty with a specialty in ballistics; Tim Speedle, a cocky yet disarming investigator who is well connected on the street, and Eric Delko, an underwater recovery expert who knows all the twists and turns of the Florida waterways. Rounding out the team is Alexx Woods, the no-nonsense, know-it-all coroner. And, after Speedle is killed in Action, Former Patrolman Ryan Wolfe joins the team. Together, these investigators collect and analyze the evidence to solve the crimes and to vindicate those who often cannot speak for themselves -- the victims.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71cc6686048e9364cc07a41c184a6363e381e612","amp;dn":"CSI%3B+Miami+Season+1+-+Season+9+Eps+18+HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71cc6686048e9364cc07a41c184a6363e381e612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,204,102,134,4,142,147,100,204,7,164,28,24,74,99,99,227,129,230,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
