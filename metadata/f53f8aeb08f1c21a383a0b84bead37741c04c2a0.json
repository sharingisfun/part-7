Nineteen sixty-one's &quot;Let's Go Trippin'&quot; was the first real surf instrumental, although the pyrotechnic fretwork of later Dale records is largely absent. Those divebomb runs, reverb drenchings, and impossibly quick picking displays materialize on the next single, &quot;Shake &amp; Stomp,&quot; then bloom on the revved-up Middle-Eastern standard &quot;Misirlou.&quot; Dale's instrumentals generally fell into two camps: standard-progression frat blasts (&quot;Take It Off,&quot; &quot;Night Rider,&quot; &quot;Mr. Eliminator&quot;) and minor-key Middle-Eastern excursions (&quot;The Wedge,&quot; the &quot;Pipeline&quot;-esque &quot;Banzai Wipeout,&quot; &quot;The Victor,&quot; even &quot;Hava Nagila&quot;--which Jewish purists must have regarded as a whore of Babylon), on which his blistering technique was more likely to find its spotlight Some of his best work is found on &quot;King of the Surf Guitar,&quot; a Duane Eddy knockoff with great vocals by the Blossoms garnished by lightning flashes of boss guitar. With all the dazzling axe-work on display (also including a beautiful 1987 duet with Stevie Ray Vaughan on the Chantays' unearthly &quot;Pipeline&quot;), the coolest cut here may be the sole vocal, &quot;Mr. Peppermint Man,&quot; on which Dale's rasp oozes a concupiscent slime over the murky tale of a lollipop Lothario who &quot;carries a little sign that says, Have some dessert.&quot; Frat rock godhead. \n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01.
