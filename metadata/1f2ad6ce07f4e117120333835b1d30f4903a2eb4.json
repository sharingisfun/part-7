S. Scott\n\n\nDescription:\n\nJason Sutherland is a billionaire investor who has it all: good looks, billions of dollars, and every expensive toy a man could ever want. What he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have is the one thing he wants the most: Hope Sinclair. Unfortunately Hope, the little sister of his best friend, was off limits. But when he finds out that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s getting married, he decides that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s staking his claim before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late, and it will take more than a little deception and risk to accomplish his goal. Hope could end up hating his guts, but after spending one forbidden night with her that he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget, he knows he has to try to make her his forever.\n\nHope Sinclair was born into money, but being rich has never made her happy. The one thing she wants is a man to care about her and not her bank account. The closest thing sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever found to real happiness was the magical, passionate night sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d spent in the arms of Jason SutherlandÃ¢â‚¬Â¦until that night turned into heartbreak. So when he unexpectedly comes back into her life in the strangest of ways, Hope is determined to resist her attraction to him.\n\nThrown together by JasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deception and with their passion still burning hot, can the two of them survive after the billionaire is unmasked?\n\n\nProduct Details:\n\nFile size: epub 395 KB, mobi 499 KB\nPublisher: Golden Unicorn Enterprises Inc\nISBN-13: 978-1-939962-50-8 (Print)\nISBN-13: 978-1-939962-49-2 (E-Book)\nLanguage: English\n\n\n\nNote: Have tested chapter links in both file types.
