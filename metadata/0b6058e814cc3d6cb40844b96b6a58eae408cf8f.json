Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times called it &quot;Pinteresque,&quot; saying, &quot;Ms. Gaitskill writes with such authority, such radar-perfect detail, that she is able to make even the most extreme situations seem real... her reportorial candor, uncompromised by sentimentality or voyeuristic charm...underscores the strength of her debut.&quot;\n\n----\n\nThe story &quot;Secretary&quot; in this collection was adapted into the film of the same name starring Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b6058e814cc3d6cb40844b96b6a58eae408cf8f","amp;dn":"Mary+Gaitskill+-+Bad+Behavior+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b6058e814cc3d6cb40844b96b6a58eae408cf8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,96,88,232,20,204,61,108,180,8,68,185,107,106,88,234,228,8,207,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
