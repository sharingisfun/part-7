The Incident went down\n    in history as fatal. Within 12 hours of  the  crash\n    the ground beneath the German  capital  is  shaking\n    with the salvoes of a war  never  meant  to  be:  a\n    conflict between  former  allies  over  Europe  and\n    global supremacy. In  this  game  the  worst  comes\n    true, and it may just change the fate of the  &quot;free\n    world&quot; forever! WWII is now just a memory - but the\n    Cold War has just begun.\n\n\n    1- Unpack, burn or mount\n    2- Install the game\n    3- Go To Hell!\n\n\n* currently we are looking for:\n\n&gt; talented cracker\n&gt; experienced movie ripper\n&gt; supply games ENGLiSH / MULTi / POLiSH\n&gt; supply any stuff\n  (movies, apps, even spycam porn of your sister)\n&gt; supply hardware (box , ftps, etc.)\n\n* you match the description? maybe you can join us!\n\n  *** WE'RE AFTER AFFILIATE PRE SITES IN EURO AND ASIA ***\n  --------------------------------------------------------\n                      teamppt [at] gmailcom\n\n\n        RELOADED + ALiAS + 0x0007 + REVOLVER + HI2U\n          JAGUAR + CRD + ROGUE + rG + MAZE + PROFiT\n\n\n                                                          o3.2oo9\n\n                                                  ascii: korma[67]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:971c47f523c6dd96558ef0ed8505c9bdf6c88722","amp;dn":"Codename.Panzers.Cold.War-PROPHET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"971c47f523c6dd96558ef0ed8505c9bdf6c88722","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,28,71,245,35,198,221,150,85,142,240,237,133,5,201,189,246,200,135,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
