Sometimes, though, we wish the old Larry Carlton were still with us, the spark-spraying fusionist whose nimble flights of fancy electrified recordings by the Crusaders and Steely Dan (&quot;Kid Charlemagne&quot; from Royal Scam) as well his own solo works throughout the 1970s and into the mid-1980s. The appeal of the smooth-jazz gravy train has defused much of Carlton's incendiary inventiveness, a conviction reinforced by the unruffled textures etched into Fingerprints, Carlton's 20th career recording. Those textures, though, are faithful to the album's apparent intent--to create a velvety-smooth soundtrack for late-night romance. No jarring oddities here, just sweetness and seduction throughout. Guests include smooth-jazz vets Abraham Laboriel, Kirk Whalum on sax, Jerry Hay on horns, Michael McDonald for a lone vocal track (&quot;'Til I Hurt You&quot;), and Vince Gill, who duets transparently on &quot;Gracias.&quot; The pick of the litter: the closing track, &quot;Crying Hands,&quot; an expressive bit of slow-dance finesse that merits repeated listenings. --Terry Wood\n\n01.
