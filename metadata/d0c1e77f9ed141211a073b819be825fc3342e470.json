The originals, which are straight-ahead jazz that utilizes Cuban polyrhythms, show off Valdes' wondrous technique well, and include one song named after Valdes' famous group &quot;Irakere.&quot; While &quot;Laureen&quot; is an emotional out-of-tempo ballad, some of the other songs find the pianist making a great deal out of very little including the lengthy vamp piece &quot;Son No. 2.&quot; He never seems to run out of ideas. The final five selections are from 1982 and have Valdes leading a five-piece rhythm section plus guest German Velasco playing soprano sax or flute on three numbers; Valdes takes &quot;Son Para Leyanis&quot; as a highly rhythmic piano solo. His &quot;Claudia&quot; is one of his best-known pieces, while the memorable &quot;Zanaith&quot; is on the same level. All in all, this is a superior reissue featuring some of Chucho ValdÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹s' best piano recordings of the era.\n-- allmusic\n\nTracks\n01- Irakere\n02- Son No 2\n03- Neurosis\n04- Laureen\n05- Palia\n06- Tema De Chaka\n07- Rabo de Nube\n08- Zanaith\n09- Son Para Leyanis\n10- Claudia\n\nArtwork (300dpi scan), EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0c1e77f9ed141211a073b819be825fc3342e470","amp;dn":"Chucho+Valdes+-+Jazz+Bata+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0c1e77f9ed141211a073b819be825fc3342e470","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,193,231,127,158,209,65,33,26,7,59,129,155,232,37,252,51,66,228,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
