FM Heaven VSTi does NOT emulate THAT well...However...these sounds\nshould KILL in Native-Instruments FM7 when it's released in May 2001\n\nThe &quot;Hollywood Collection&quot; I collected in Hollywood, California\nfrom different studios &amp; musicians when I worked as a messenger for Music Express running for the record companies &amp; movie lots in 1986.\n\nThe &quot;Various Other Sources&quot; was collected from musicians &amp; music stores on the road over a span of years.\n\nThe &quot;19424 DX-7 SOUNDS&quot; I collected from searches on the internet.\n\n**Notes**\nThere ARE some banks that are named the same as others (as well as some patches)...BUT...that does NOT necessarily mean the sounds are the same one's! (Tho you will find some here &amp; there) It's gonna take you quite a while to go thru them All...IF you ever do.\n\n  I am sharing this collection in the hope that some will use them to a musical advantage to the world.\n  There are some GREAT sounds here!\n      \n     Enjoy!\n   \n   LiVeMuSiC\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nI've just repacked it to make it available again. The .syx files also work in FM8, though FM8 is shipped with so many presets. \n\nI remember reading that there are about 5000 sounds in this collection .... as the man says Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0542826f71b6a8a3bee9188310de5cef655177d","amp;dn":"ENTER_Yamaha-DX7_Collection_for_FM7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0542826f71b6a8a3bee9188310de5cef655177d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,84,40,38,247,27,106,138,59,238,145,136,49,13,229,206,246,85,23,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
