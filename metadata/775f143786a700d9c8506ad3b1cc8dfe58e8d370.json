Here's your lifeline! Fluid Mechanics Demystified helps you absorb the essentials of this challenging engineering topic. Written in an easy-to-follow format, this practical guide begins by reviewing basic principles and discussing fluid statics. Next, you'll dive into fluids in motion, integral and differential equations, dimensional analysis, and similitude. Internal, external, and compressible flows are also covered. Hundreds of worked examples and equations make it easy to understand the material, and end-of-chapter quizzes and two final exam, with solutions to all their problems, help reinforce learning.\nThis hands-on, self-teaching text offers:\nNumerous figures to illustrate key concepts\nDetails on Bernoulli's equation and the Reynolds number\nCoverage of entrance, laminar, turbulent, open channel, and boundary layer flows\nSI units throughout","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:775f143786a700d9c8506ad3b1cc8dfe58e8d370","amp;dn":"Fluid+Mechanics+DeMYSTiFied","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"775f143786a700d9c8506ad3b1cc8dfe58e8d370","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,95,20,55,134,167,0,217,200,80,106,211,177,204,141,254,88,232,211,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
