It resembled Crash in it's look and feel, but with a slightly\nless serious tone that increased as time went on. After Newsfield went\nbankrupt in October 1991, Europress picked up the title which ran as\nZzap! until 1992, before renaming it &quot;Commodore Force&quot;. It limped along\nfor another year before suddenly being canned.\n\nThese PDFs are the complied collections of page scans available on\npublic Torrent trackers. They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and\ncopying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd\nlike to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most\nPDF readers, including the iPad. Also included is issue 107, which was\nproduced as a &quot;Commemorative&quot; issue by many ex-Newsfield staff.\n\nThe OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the\nmore unusual fonts and layouts used (especially in later issues), and by\nthe relatively low DPI of the source images. Also, paragraph formatting\nis a bit random at best; again, this is worse in the later issues.\n\nThe file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG\nimages; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible\nwithout losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)\n\nMore OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check\nfor more information.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(www.worldofspectrum.org), and everyone on the WoS forums for help and\nadvice.\n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine.
