He chose the name &quot;Panda Bear&quot; because he drew pictures of pandas as artwork on the recordings he made as a younger musician. Lennox grew up in the Roland Park section of Baltimore, Maryland, and had attended high school in Pennsylvania. As a child, he played sports and had studied piano and cello. He later sang tenor in his high school chamber choir. Lennox and Animal Collective member Deakin (Josh Dibb) have been friends since the second grade. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b579cbf82c4c6a14bff3e8e61020c63f319cd5c3","amp;dn":"Panda+Bear-7+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b579cbf82c4c6a14bff3e8e61020c63f319cd5c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,121,203,248,44,76,106,20,191,243,232,230,16,32,198,63,49,156,213,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
