Blow the dust of your old CD-burner, TEST IT thoroughly before proceeding.\n2. Copy the file &quot;teleatlas.ccp&quot; to &quot;C:Program Files (x86)SlySoftCloneCDProfiles&quot;.\n3. Launch SlySoft CloneCD, click 'I Agree', then click 'Try It!' for the trial version.\n4. Select 'Write from imageFile' (CD icon with a pencil).\n5. Click 'browse', select the file &quot;cd2-BNL_2013_2014-MS_DXv1.ccd&quot; from the &quot;DX-BNL-2014&quot; folder; click 'Open', then 'Next &gt;'.\n6. Put a blank CD in your CD-burner; now select your CD-burner and click 'Next &gt;'.\n7. IMPORTANT: set the 'Write Speed' to '4x (704 kByte/s)' (try a few different speeds if it doesn't work, but never exceed 8x).\n8. IMPORTANT: select the 'teleatlas' profile; now click 'OK', then 'Try It!'.\n9. Wait for it to complete; you can safely ignore the yellow warnings, that's just CloneCD telling you that sectors are being amplified.\n\nPut the disk in your Blaupunkt Travelpilot DX-series radio and wait for it to load, try to enter an address in order to verify that it really works.\n\nIf it works: yay, now burn a second copy just to be safe!\nIf it does not work: \n 1) try a different burner,\n 2) try different write speeds,\n 3) use another brand of blank CD media.\n\n(in this order, its usually the burner that's not capable enough).\n\nI successfully burned this for a Travelpilot DX-r52\n using a Samsung Writemaster (Model SH-S182) CD-burner, connected via a generic IDE to USB adapter.\nI'm running Windows 7 Pro x64, CloneCD version 5.3.1.4 (trial).\n\nSource: gpsunderground.com topics and some fooling around.\n\n(instructions are valid for all Travelpilot DX CD's from all countries)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beb9a25e280b1a5c32c4a735120ed2dcd9b71427","amp;dn":"Blaupunkt+Travelpilot+DX+Benelux+%282013-2014%29+navigation+CD+disk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beb9a25e280b1a5c32c4a735120ed2dcd9b71427","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,185,162,94,40,11,26,92,50,196,167,53,18,14,210,220,217,183,20,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
