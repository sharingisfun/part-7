A caption explains the concept illustrated on each page, and a few simple sentences reinforce the concept with interactive (programmed) learning, which links to the following page. Dr. Dubin's light and entertaining style, known world-wide, makes learning enjoyable. Practice twelve-lead tracings at the end establish self-confidence, and summarised reference sheets with examples (designed to be copied) provide an excellent review. This work is most recently updated in February 2006.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7916db58a9ddc0bf1fe2418f480930a4544b03b6","amp;dn":"Dubin+-+Rapid+Interpretation+of+EKGs+6ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7916db58a9ddc0bf1fe2418f480930a4544b03b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,22,219,88,169,221,192,191,31,226,65,143,72,9,48,164,84,75,3,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
