It was mainly recorded in Columbia Studio A, Nashville, from September 22 to 26, 1970. &quot;Sing Another Song, Boys&quot; was recorded at the Isle of Wight Festival on August 30, 1970. Further recording took place at Trident Studios in London. The album reached #145 on the Billboard list, but was his most commercially successful album in many other parts of the world, reaching #4 in the UK and #8 in Australia[1].\n\nThe album title is descriptive, outlining its main themes. The songs contain emotive language and are frankly personal; &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; ends with the line &quot;Sincerely, L. Cohen&quot;. The back cover of the album bears the lines:\n\nThey locked up a man\nWho wanted to rule the world\nThe fools\nThey locked up the wrong man\n\nA remastered CD was released in 1995. Simply Vinyl issued a short-lived remastered edition on vinyl in 2002, making it the last Cohen album (aside from Ten New Songs, which was pressed in limited quantities) to go out of print on vinyl.\n\nIn 2007 Columbia/Legacy released a newly remastered CD with a new book style packaging and a bonus track: a 1968 recording of Dress Rehearsal Rag.\n\nIt was ranked 74 on Pitchfork Media&amp;#039;s list of the 100 best albums of the 1970s.\n\n    * Avalanche\n    * Last Year&amp;#039;s Man\n    * Dress Rehearsal Rag\n    * Diamonds In The Mine\n    * Love Calls You By Your Name\n    * Famous Blue Raincoat\n    * Sing Another Song, Boys - (Live)\n    * Joan Of Arc\n    * Dress Rehearsal Rag\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdf6397b5525300db44eee1270e2810f3f4d69a1","amp;dn":"leonard+cohen+-++Songs+Of+Love+And+Hate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdf6397b5525300db44eee1270e2810f3f4d69a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,246,57,123,85,37,48,13,180,78,238,18,112,226,129,15,63,77,105,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
