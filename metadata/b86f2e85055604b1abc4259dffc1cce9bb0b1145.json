Thus, there is a need for a book focused on materials requirements in fuel cells. Key Materials in LowÃ¢â‚¬â€œTemperature Fuel Cells is a concise source of the most important and key materials and catalysts in lowÃ¢â‚¬â€œtemperature fuel cells. A related book will cover key materials in highÃ¢â‚¬â€œtemperature fuel cells. The two books form part of the &quot;Materials for Sustainable Energy &amp; Development&quot; series.\nKey Materials in LowÃ¢â‚¬â€œTemperature Fuel Cells brings together world leaders and experts in this field and provides a lucid description of the materials assessment of fuel cell technologies. With an emphasis on the technical development and applications of key materials in lowÃ¢â‚¬â€œtemperature fuel cells, this text covers fundamental principles, advancement, challenges, and important current research themes. Topics covered include: proton exchange membrane fuel cells, direct methanol and ethanol fuel cells, microfluidic fuel cells, biofuel cells, alkaline membrane fuel cells, functionalized carbon nanotubes as catalyst supports, nanostructured Pt catalysts, nonÃ¢â‚¬â€œPGM catalysts, membranes, and materials modeling.\nThis book is an essential reference source for researchers, engineers and technicians in academia, research institutes and industry working in the fields of fuel cells, energy materials, electrochemistry and materials science and engineering.\n\nProduct Description\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nKey Materials in LowÃ¢â‚¬â€œTemperature Fuel Cells is a concise source of the most important and key materials and catalysts in lowÃ¢â‚¬â€œtemperature fuel cells.

Lu. The series covers advances in materials science and innovation for renewable energy, clean use of fossil energy, and greenhouse gas mitigation and associated environmental technologies.\n\nAbout the Author\nProfessor San Ping Jiang is a professor at the Curtin Centre for Advanced Energy Science and Engineering, Curtin University, Australia and Adjunct Professor of the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China. He also holds Visiting/Guest Professorships at Wuhan University of Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Sichung University, and Shandong University. Dr. Jiang has broad experience in both academia and industry, having held positions at Nanyang Technological University, the CSIRO Manufacturing Science and Technology Division in Australia, and Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd (CFCL). His research interests encompass solid oxide fuel cells, proton exchange and direct methanol fuel cells, and direct alcohol fuel cells. With an hÃ¢â‚¬â€œindex of 32, Jiang has published over 180 journal papers, which have accrued Ã¢Ë†Â¼3500 citations. In 2007 two papers were ranked in the top 1% in Chemistry and Engineering (Web of Sciences Essential Science Indicators).\n\nProfessor Yushan Yan has been a professor at the University of California, Riverside since 1998. Prior to that he worked for AlliedSignal Inc. as a Senior Staff Engineer and Project Manager. His research focuses on zeolite thin films for semiconductors and aerospace applications and new materials for cheaper and durable fuel cells. He is coÃ¢â‚¬â€œFounder and Director of the startÃ¢â‚¬â€œup companies Full Cycle Energy and Zeolite Materials Solutions (ZSM). ToÃ¢â‚¬â€œdate Yan has published ca. 100 journal articles which have attracted an average of 33 citations per paper.\n\nPublisher: Wiley VCH (21 January 2015)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3527330429\nISBN-13: 978-3527330423","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b86f2e85055604b1abc4259dffc1cce9bb0b1145","amp;dn":"Materials+for+Low-Temperature+Fuel+Cells%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b86f2e85055604b1abc4259dffc1cce9bb0b1145","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,111,46,133,5,86,4,177,171,196,37,157,255,193,204,233,187,11,17,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
