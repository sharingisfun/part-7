Since then, romance has changed-and so have IÃ¢â‚¬â€so I decided to give the book a makeoverÃ¢â‚¬â€and a new title, When Strangers Marry. I have two reasons for changing the title. First, it is in keeping with the new spirit of the book; second, no oneÃ¢â‚¬â€including my own motherÃ¢â‚¬â€found the original one memorable!\n\nIn When Strangers Marry, I had a great time rediscovering the story of Maximilien Vallerand and his stolen bride, Lysette. The promise of this handsome, though mysterious, man's love proves irresistable to her, but she doesn't know the secrets he hides.\n\nI hope you will enjoy revisiting the Vallerand family, or perhaps meeting them for the first time. And, as always thank you for your support and encouragement, as we escape together into the magical world of romance novels.\n\nWishing you love and happiness,\n\nLisa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b4a93ad71bb09d6af1b53f3958ace4188071dac","amp;dn":"Lisa+Kleypas+-+When+Strangers+Marry+%28Vallerands+Series+1%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b4a93ad71bb09d6af1b53f3958ace4188071dac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,74,147,173,113,187,9,214,175,27,83,243,149,138,206,65,136,7,29,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
