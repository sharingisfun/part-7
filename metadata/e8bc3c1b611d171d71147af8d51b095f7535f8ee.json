This time, the next three candidates are put through the grueling hands-on interview process.\n\nTheir first test is about local ingredients, and the chefs are presented with the little-used ingredient of kid meat. It's David versus Goliath as 21-year-old Joshua is pitted against 48-year-old events chef Leslie. Also in the mix is local boy David, who hopes his understanding of the area will push him through. This round is far from clear-cut as a confident Leslie clashes with owner Mario and questions are asked about young Joshua's experience.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 28-Apr-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8bc3c1b611d171d71147af8d51b095f7535f8ee","amp;dn":"Alex.Polizzi.Chefs.On.Trial.S01E06.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8bc3c1b611d171d71147af8d51b095f7535f8ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,188,60,27,97,29,23,29,113,20,122,248,213,27,9,95,117,53,248,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
