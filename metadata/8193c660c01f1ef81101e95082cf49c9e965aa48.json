As of April 2013, the album had sold 225,000 copies in the United States.Album\n\nThe album, Beyond Hell/Above Heaven was released on 10 September 2010. Michael Poulsen explained the title of the album stating &quot;...itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a way telling people that we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t belong or believe in neither heaven nor hell. So if we go beyond hell, we will make heaven look like hell, and if we go above heaven, we will make hell look like heaven. Heaven and hell is something we create in our minds and personal self-created demons come out of that.&quot; Featured on the album is previously released track, &quot;A Warrior's Call&quot;, which was made for Danish boxer Mikkel Kessler. The track Evelyn contains some death grunts provided by Mark &quot;Barney&quot; Greenway (Napalm Death), which was a whole new element on Volbeat's music.\n\nMichael Poulsen has also revealed several of the guest musicians on the album stating &quot;IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m very very proud to have these fine gentlemen with me, since they inspired me a lot for a long time.&quot;\n\nCover and Artwork By Karsten Sand (Wrysand)\nReception\nProfessional ratings\nReview scores\nSource \tRating\nAllmusic \t3.5/5 stars\n\nThe Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 3.5 stars stating &quot;Any way you slice it, Volbeat, a skillful repository of so many lineage sounds, are their own thing: a band apart who are sophisticated, accessible, and utterly entertaining as songwriters and performers.
