In fact, that is the only songs like that on the entire CD. The rest of the songs (except &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;) are hard, loud, and some are offensive. That's not to say that they aren't good, though. I love the songs &quot;Tap, Twist, Snap&quot; and &quot;American Pig,&quot; but the funniest song on the entire CD is &quot;Cash.&quot; If it weren't for that song, this CD might have slipped by without the Parental Advisory. &quot;RPM&quot; is pretty good, too, as is &quot;Breathe.&quot; &quot;Speed Home California&quot; is OK, and I'd suggest listening to &quot;High Anxiety&quot; when you're in a bad mood (LET IT OUT! LET IT OUT!). If you like bands like Limp Bizkit and Sublime, then I'd suggest this CD.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nSugar Ray - Floored\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Sugar Ray\nAlbum................: Floored\nGenre................: Ska Punk, Post-Punk\nSource...............: CD\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
