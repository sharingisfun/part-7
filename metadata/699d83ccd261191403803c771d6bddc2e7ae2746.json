Chuck Palahniuk's darkly funny first novel tells the story of a godforsaken young man who discovers that his rage at living in a world filled with failure and lies cannot be pacified by an empty consumer culture. Relief for him and his disenfranchised peers comes in the form of secret after-hours boxing matches held in the basements of bars. Fight Club is the brainchild of Tyler Durden, who thinks he has found a way for himself and his friends to live beyond their confining and stultifying lives. But in Tyler's world there are no rules, no limits, no brakes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:699d83ccd261191403803c771d6bddc2e7ae2746","amp;dn":"Fight+Club+-+Chuck+Palahniuk.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"699d83ccd261191403803c771d6bddc2e7ae2746","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,157,131,204,210,97,25,20,3,128,60,119,29,107,221,194,231,174,39,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
