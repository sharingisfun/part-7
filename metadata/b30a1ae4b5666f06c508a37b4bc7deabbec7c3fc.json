It features Harvey Keitel as a pianist who also works for his loan shark father as a &quot;collector&quot;. He is a conflicted soul, torn between his art, his loyalty to his father, his sexuality, and his past. The film makes use of music to create a dichotomy between what the viewer is hearing and what they are seeing, which helps them feel the schizophrenia being experienced by the protagonist.\n\nIncludes a smug superficial documentary and original trailer.\n\n\n Harvey Keitel ...

Arthur Fox \n\nThe film was remade in 2005 as The Beat That My Heart Skipped.\n\nThe only film to have been financed by FabergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Brut (Cary Grant was on their board of directors at the time and steered his fellow members to believe in Toback), itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s positively redolent with the drugstore after-shave, and pulses with a unapologetic sexual energy that the period was known for. Jimmy brazenly approaches women and talks to them in ways that would have him on NOWÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hit list, and other races come in for a bruising in language that would never pass the censors today. Still, the film has a moving, messy humanity and an urgency that makes it clear why it has enjoyed something of a renaissance in recent years. \n\nThe cinematographer, Michael Chapman, who also lensed Taxi Driver for Scorsese, gives Fingers a similar look: dark, gritty, but splashed with rich, violent color.  \n\nA number of gem-like cameos are studded throughout: Stage actress Marian Seldes as JimmyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s asylum-dwelling mother; Danny Aiello as one half of the two-member bodyguard detail surrounding arch-villain Riccamonza, the other half being Ed Marinaro; Tanya Roberts, in a bikini which slips off easily, as RiccamonzaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s girlfriend; Lenny Montana (The Godfather) as the pizzeria owner (filmed at JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Pizzeria on Bleecker Street), and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are you ready for this? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ GOP fundraiser heavy Georgette Mosbacher as JimmyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cheap and tawdry girlfriend, Anita. (Checking it out, it makes sense, she was then married to the producer, George Barrie.) \n\nFrancois Truffaut named it as one of his favorite films from an American director in years. Shortly afterwards while at The Beverly Hills Hotel, Toback spotted the famous French auteur poolside, who was in town during the making of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Instead of approaching him directly to thank him and risk putting Truffaut on the spot, opted to page him on a house telephone, as was the fashion of the day. When he picked up the phone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Toback watching from inside the hotel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he graciously thanked Truffaut for his support, only to be met with a long silence. Getting flustered, he suggested that he would love to meet Truffaut for a drink while he was in town. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think that would be a good idea,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ replied Truffaut. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhy is that?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ asked Toback. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI think we should just continue communicating to each other through our films.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nTwo notable pieces from the film are &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; by Merrilee Rush and &quot;Summertime, Summertime&quot; by The Jamies. Director Toback, who is very knowledgeable about music, initially wanted to use the song &quot;Summertime&quot; because the movie had &quot;a summertime feel to it,&quot; and they wanted to shoot it during the summer months. It wasn't to be however, yet he thought it appropriate enough to leave the song in there. \n\n&quot;Now Is Forever&quot;\nMusic by George Barrie\nLyrics by Sammy Cahn\nItalian lyrics by Pat Noto\nSung by Jerry Vale\nReleased by Buddah Records\n\n&quot;Summertime, Summertime&quot;\nWritten by Sherman Feller and Tom Jameson\nPerformed by The Jamies\nCourtesy of Epic Records\n\n&quot;Mockingbird&quot;\nWritten by Charlie Foxx and Inez Foxx\nPerformed by Charlie &amp; Inez Foxx\nCourtesy of United Artist Records\n\n&quot;One Fine Day&quot;\nWritten by Gerry Goffin and Carole King\nPerformed by The Chiffons\nCourtesy of Laurie Records\n\n&quot;Angel of the Morning&quot;\nWritten by Chip Taylor\nPerformed by Merrilee Rush and The Turnabouts\nCourtesy of Bell Records\n\n&quot;Baby Talk&quot;\nWritten by Melvin Schawrtz\nPerformed by Jan &amp; Dean\nCourtesy of United Artist Records\n\n&quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;\nWritten by Ben E.
