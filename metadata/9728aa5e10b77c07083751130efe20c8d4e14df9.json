Burn or mount disk image (.cue)\n2. Locate CD-Rom drive's root directory then execute SETUP.exe manually.\n3. Skip DirectX setup unless your PC falls into antique category.\n\nNote: Both Secrets Can Kill and Stay Tuned for Danger are discontinued due to sound card problem with newer PC system. However those are working flawlessly under Core 2 duo based 32-bit Windows 7 environment. Who knows? It's my wild guess that the initial version released by Her Interactive do have a problem then later Dreamcatcher version sorted'em out. Of course, this torrent comes from Dreamcatcher version.\n\nEnjoy the game!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9728aa5e10b77c07083751130efe20c8d4e14df9","amp;dn":"Nancy+Drew+-+Stay+Tuned+for+Danger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9728aa5e10b77c07083751130efe20c8d4e14df9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,40,170,94,16,183,124,7,8,55,81,19,14,254,32,200,212,225,77,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
