In his notes (conveniently placed after each letter and not at the end of the book), the editor gives just the right amount of background and further information to explain references to people and events in the letters.&quot; (Times Literary Supplement, March 2010)\n\n&quot;A beautifully produced and immaculately edited volume, [McGuinness] collects together a rich mass of letters and other documents.&quot; (London Review of Books, January 2009)\n\n&quot;Primarily a historical and biographical resource. The editor's stated aim is to picture a portion of Wittgenstein's 'pattern of ... life and work' centered on Cambridge. He has ... succeeded.&quot; (Notre Dame Reviews, October 2008)\n\n===================================================================================\nFrom the Back Cover\nThis volume collects the most substantial correspondence and documents relating to WittgensteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long association with Cambridge between the years 1911 and his death in 1951, including the letters he exchanged with his most illustrious Cambridge contemporaries Russell, Keynes, Moore, and Ramsey (and previously published as Cambridge Letters). It provides a fascinating glimpse of the philosopher Ã¢â‚¬â€œ appearing in turn withdrawn and affectionate, fierce and censorious, happy to collaborate and sure of his own judgement. Quarrels and reconciliations are documented, along with his struggles to publish the Tractatus, his retreat from the world and his eventual return to philosophy.\nThis significantly expanded new volume adds to the existing collection some 200 previously unpublished letters and documents, including 40 letters from Wittgenstein to his friend and Cambridge contemporary, the economist Piero Sraffa; a substantial body of letters between Wittgenstein and some of his most celebrated pupils, including Rhees, Von Wright and Norman Malcolm; and minutes relating WittgensteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incursions into University business and The Moral Sciences Club.\nThis collection will prove a fascinating and unique read for anyone with an interest in WittgensteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work, his character and the institutional and personal context within which they took shape.\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nBrian McGuinness is now Professor of the History of Philosophy at Siena. Past publications include the translation of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (with David Pears) and A Life of Wittegenstein (Volume 1, Young Ludwig, 1988), the second volume of which is due to be published shortly.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f52c326b06feed0f3fe9b732b4219456a4b636c8","amp;dn":"Brian+McGuinness+-+Wittgenstein+in+Cambridge.+Letters+and+Docume","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f52c326b06feed0f3fe9b732b4219456a4b636c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,44,50,107,6,254,237,15,63,233,183,50,180,33,148,86,164,182,54,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
