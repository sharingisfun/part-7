Motivation, however, needs to be carefully controlled and regulated to be effective.\r\n\r\nThis book surveys the most recent psychological research on how motivational processes are regulated in daily life to achieve desired outcomes. Contributors are all leading international investigators, and they explore such exciting questions as: What is the relationship between motivation and self-control? What is the role of affect and cognition in regulating motivation? How do conscious and unconscious motivational processes interact? What role do physiological processes play in controlling motivation? How can we regulate aggressive impulses? How do affective states control motivation? Can motivation distort perception and attention? What are the social, cultural and interpersonal effects of motivational control?\r\n\r\nUnderstanding human motivation is not only of theoretical interest, but is also fundamental to applied fields such as clinical, counseling, educational, organizational, marketing and industrial psychology. The book is also suitable as an advanced textbook in courses in motivational sciences, and is recommended to students, teachers, researchers and applied professionals as well as laypersons interested in the psychology of human motivation and self-control","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c957af7fb3d2f0b1fd8540db4f96e21c9b185f1","amp;dn":"Motivation+and+Its+Regulation%3A+The+Control+Within+%5B2014%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c957af7fb3d2f0b1fd8540db4f96e21c9b185f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,149,122,247,251,61,47,11,31,216,84,13,180,249,110,33,201,177,133,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
