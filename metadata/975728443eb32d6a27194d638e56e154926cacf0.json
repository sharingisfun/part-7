In its commitment to the individual against the powers that be it is as relevant today as when it was awarded the 1962 Palme D'Or in Cannes. The film was championed by FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Truffaut on the jury and beat out such contenders as Federico Fellini, Luchino Visconti, Michelangelo Antonioni, Luis BuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±uel, and Robert Bresson. 1962 became a fundamental year for Brazilian Cinema because of the national impact of the European recognition. Ze is an exceedingly poor man from the Brazilian backlands. His most prized possession is his donkey. When his donkey falls terminally ill, Ze makes a promise to God. If his donkey recovers, he will carry a cross-like Jesus-all the way from the backlands to the state capital. When the miracle happens, Ze leaves on his journey. He makes it to the church, but there is a problem. The priest refuses to accept the cross once he hears the reason for such sacrifice and in short time the peasant's mission is turned into a media circus, misinterpreted by everyone.\n\nFile Name .........................................: O Pagador de Promessas.cd1.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 733,204,480 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 00:49:12\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD\nFrame Size ......................................: 560x416 (AR: 1.346)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1790 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.320 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000(AC3, Dolby Laboratories, Inc) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\nFile Name .........................................: O Pagador de Promessas.cd2.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 735,180,800 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 00:42:18\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD\nFrame Size ......................................: 560x416 (AR: 1.346)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 2120 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.380 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000(AC3, Dolby Laboratories, Inc) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\n\nSorry, no subs. thnaks SilvioSantos for the rip\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
