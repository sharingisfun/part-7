Undoubtedly, these three figures did much to shape the group's sound, but throughout their career, the Yardbirds were very much a unit, albeit a rather unstable one. And they were truly one of the great rock bands; one whose contributions went far beyond the scope of their half dozen or so mid-'60s.\n\nFor Your Love is the first American album by English rock band The Yardbirds. Released in 1965, the album is a mix of US-only tracks and previously released singles compiled by Yardbirds' producer, Giorgio Gomelsky. The album, which was released as the Yardbirds were preparing for their first American tour, reached number 96 in Billboard's Top LPs chart.\nFor Your Love features three songs from Jeff Beck's first recording sessions with the Yardbirds: &quot;I'm Not Talking&quot;, &quot;I Ain't Done Wrong&quot;, and &quot;My Girl Sloopy&quot; (these songs were later released in the UK on the Five Yardbirds EP). Eric Clapton provided the guitar for the remainder of the tracks, which included the three Yardbirds singles (with B-sides) released up to that time and two demos which were not released in the UK until the 1980s. Clapton, who left the band four months earlier in March 1965, is not pictured on the album cover nor mentioned in the liner notes.\n\nThe Yardbirds' 2001 compilation album Ultimate! contains eight of the eleven tracks from the original album. For Your Love has been reissued by several record labels, including JVC, Castle, and Repertoire. In addition to the eleven tracks from the original album, the Repertoire reissue includes Yardbirds' demos recorded with Eric Clapton December 1963 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ November 1964, a demo with Indian musicians, a single B-side with Jeff Beck, and an Italian single with Beck and with Chris Dreja.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
