As a trumpet virtuoso, his playing, beginning with the 1920s studio recordings made with his Hot Five and Hot Seven ensembles, charted a future for jazz in highly imaginative, emotionally charged improvisation. For this, he is revered by jazz fans. But Armstrong also became an enduring figure in popular music, due to his distinctively phrased bass singing and engaging personality, which were on display in a series of vocal recordings and film roles.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tJazz\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Sugar\n02.Do You Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans\n03.St. Louis Blues\n04.Basin Street Blues\n05.Everybody's Talkin (Echoes)\n06.I Gotta Right To Sing The Blues\n07.Medley Of Hits I'll Be Glad When You're DeadYou Rascal\n08.Ain't Misbehavin'\n09.Rockin' Chair\n10.Mood Indigo\n11.My One And Only Love\n12.Someday You'll Be Sorry\n13.What A Wonderful World\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad4ffaf2bb2204d5c1a482d1c80499d0d7f03be3","amp;dn":"Louis+Armstrong+-+Greatest+Hits+%281996%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad4ffaf2bb2204d5c1a482d1c80499d0d7f03be3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,79,250,242,187,34,4,213,193,164,130,209,200,4,153,208,215,240,59,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
