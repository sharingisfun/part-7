Its heart is keyed to that of its protagonist, Georgy Makharashvili, an aging Georgian farmer who ventures beyond his rural village in search of his son, Goderdzi, a tankman and army lieutenant during World War II who has written home that he has been wounded. GoderdziÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mother tells her husband just before his departure: Do not come back without our son! The manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s odyssey takes him into battle, into warÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heart of darkness. Along the way, he also dons a uniform to become a soldierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and a good thing, too; for it is in Berlin, at its fall, that he reunites with his son. Briefly. Goderdzi, freshly wounded, dies with Georgy by his side.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Jariskatsis mama.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,428,105,216 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:26:46\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 688x512 (AR: 1.344)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1737 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.197 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 448 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169828/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169828/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRussian audio; multilanguage subpack (Russian French Spanish Portuguese Japanese Swedish English German Dutch Italian Hebrew Arabic Chinese)\n\nMy rip of the DVD posted at KG by niloarias, whom we thank\n\nRezo Chkheidze - Jariskatsis mama AKA Father of a soldier (1964)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51020b717d1515dcd3ce0ddf4c947ff10dc88e5a","amp;dn":"Rezo+Chkheidze+-+Jariskatsis+mama+AKA+Father+of+a+soldier+%281964%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51020b717d1515dcd3ce0ddf4c947ff10dc88e5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,2,11,113,125,21,21,220,211,206,13,223,76,148,127,241,13,200,142,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
