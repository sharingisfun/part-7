It is based on BartPE.\n\nAll programs included in UBCDWin are freeware utilities for Windows. Bart's PE \nbuilds a Windows &quot;pre-install&quot; environment CD, which is basically like Windows \nbooted from CD. It features network support, the ability to modify NTFS volumes, \nrecover deleted files, create new NTFS volumes, and scan hard drives for \nviruses. This project includes (hopefully) nearly everything needed to repair \nsystem problems.\n\nThe UBCDWin takes some time to boot, but once it's up, the user is running an \nalmost fully functional copy of Windows XP from the CD. This means that the \nusual diagnostic tools, partition management capability, etc. that are normally \navailable in XP are available at a time while the hard drives are offlineÃ¢â‚¬â€\nallowing the user to run chkdsk against the C drive, for instance. There are \nadditional tools, in particular anti-spyware and anti-virus software, which can \nbe run against the drives while the computer's operating system is offline (and \nmalware is therefore dormant and more vulnerable to cleaning).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUse poweriso to burn iso file..!1\n\nBoot from dvd drive..!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:841f8ff74cd133e7887d519ecbdd1c99545717cd","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Boot+CD+5.3.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"841f8ff74cd133e7887d519ecbdd1c99545717cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,31,143,247,76,209,51,231,136,125,81,158,203,221,28,153,84,87,23,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
