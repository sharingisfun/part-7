It was influential in the development of the zombie genre and in popularizing the concept of a worldwide apocalypse due to disease. The novel was a success and was adapted to film as The Last Man on Earth in 1964, as The Omega Man in 1971, and as I Am Legend in 2007, along with an unofficial direct to video production capitalizing on that film, I Am Omega. It was also the inspiration behind the 1968 film Night of the Living Dead.\n\n\n\nThe novel's main character is Robert Neville, apparently the sole survivor of a pandemic the symptoms of which resemble vampirism. The author details Neville's daily life in Los Angeles, as he attempts to comprehend, research, and possibly cure the disease that killed mankind, and to which he is immune (Neville assumes this is because he was bitten by a vampire bat who was &quot;infected&quot;. Because it was not a human, it did not kill Neville, instead, he became ill for a period of time). Neville's past is revealed through flashbacks, while his emotional struggle to cope with losing his humanity is dealt with by going about a daily routine.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/i_am_legend.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/i_am_legend.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCast:\nRichard Matheson's 1954 cult classic, read by Angus McInnes.\n\n\nI Am Legend - 01 of 09\nI Am Legend - 02 of 09\nI Am Legend - 03 of 09\nI Am Legend - 04 of 09\nI Am Legend - 05 of 09\nI Am Legend - 06 of 09\nI Am Legend - 07 of 09\nI Am Legend - 08 of 09\nI Am Legend - 09 of 09\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\t\n\n\n[\n\n\nI post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don't have time to keep trying.\nIf it's down then it's skipped.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter so you don't miss any\n\n\nOr add the RSS feed in uTorrent (In FEEDS on the left add)\n\n\n\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2b1412b80c85eadeecacc0059b72514ae8bd593","amp;dn":"I+Am+Legend+-+AudioBook+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2b1412b80c85eadeecacc0059b72514ae8bd593","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,177,65,43,128,200,94,173,238,202,204,0,89,183,37,20,174,139,213,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
