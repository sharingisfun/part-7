The first sections deal with key power electronics technologies, MOSFETs and IGBTs, including series and parallel associations. The next section examines silicon carbide and its potentiality for power electronics applications and its present limitations. Then, a dedicated section presents the capacitors, key passive components in power electronics, followed by a modeling method allowing the stray inductances computation, necessary for the precise simulation of switching waveforms. Thermal behavior associated with power switches follows, and the last part proposes some interesting prospectives associated to Power Electronics integration.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 576 pages\n# Publisher: Wiley-ISTE (April 27, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1848210647\n# ISBN-13: 978-1848210646","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5f8024604bd0172f6c7457ccd1609b5467b2e74","amp;dn":"Power+Electronics+Semiconductor+Devices%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5f8024604bd0172f6c7457ccd1609b5467b2e74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,248,2,70,4,189,1,114,246,199,69,124,205,22,9,181,70,123,46,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
