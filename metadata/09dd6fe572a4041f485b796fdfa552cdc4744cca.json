Starring Patrick Stewart, Neve Campbell and Cherie Lunghi. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115820/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115820/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDVD rip. For our non-region 1 friends who can't get this. Note that this is encoded with x264 using High Profile features, so it may not play well or at all on some devices like older PCs or AppleTV.\n\nThis is a replacement for http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5415519. 100ms audio sync delay on the DVD has been corrected. Some noise has been removed from the darker areas, but the DVD is badly mastered with quite a bit of chroma noise, and it's impossible to remove it all without hurting image quality.\n\nPlease be considerate and seed after downloading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09dd6fe572a4041f485b796fdfa552cdc4744cca","amp;dn":"The+Canterville+Ghost+%281996%29+made+for+TV+movie+-+Patrick+Stewart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09dd6fe572a4041f485b796fdfa552cdc4744cca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,221,111,229,114,164,4,31,72,91,121,111,223,165,82,205,196,116,76,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
