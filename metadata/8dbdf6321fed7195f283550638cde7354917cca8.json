Whether you're a beginner or veteran to stretching and exercise, you can easily follow Grandmaster Kang's 7-week routine based on the belt system of Taekwondo, an ancient Korean martial art. With each week of the regimen, you will learn new skills and techniques that culminate in mastery of the techniques necessary to continue exercising and eating right for life.\nThrough the use of Taekwondo stretches and movements, this black belt &quot;Combined Dynamic Stretching&quot; method will improve your flexibility and balance, stamina and strength, as well as your focus and mental health.
