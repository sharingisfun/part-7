One glimpse and a person is driven to deadly violence. No one knows what it is or where it came from.\n\nFive years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remain, including Malorie and her two young children. Living in an abandoned house near the river, she has dreamed of fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now, that the boy and girl are four, it is time to go. But the journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a rowboatÃ¢â‚¬â€blindfoldedÃ¢â‚¬â€with nothing to rely on but her wits and the childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trained ears. One wrong choice and they will die. And something is following them. But is it man, animal, or monster?\n\nEngulfed in darkness, surrounded by sounds both familiar and frightening, Malorie embarks on a harrowing odysseyÃ¢â‚¬â€a trip that takes her into an unseen world and back into the past, to the companions who once saved her. Under the guidance of the stalwart Tom, a motely group of strangers banded together against the unseen terror, creating order from the chaos. But when supplies ran low, they were forced to venture outsideÃ¢â‚¬â€and confront the ultimate question: in a world gone mad, who can really be trusted?\n\nInterweaving past and present, Josh MalermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breathtaking debut is a horrific and gripping snapshot of a world unraveled that will have you racing to the final page","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3182f167059c98b8e61feb54d84c2f600c94413","amp;dn":"Bird+Box+-+Don%27t+Open+Your+Eyes+-+Josh+Malerman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3182f167059c98b8e61feb54d84c2f600c94413","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,24,47,22,112,89,201,139,142,97,254,181,77,132,194,246,0,201,68,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
