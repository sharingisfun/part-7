Its state-of-the-art cinematography creates an intimate sense of place and captures a world of wonder, transporting viewers to isolated, undisturbed corners of the globe so pure they remind us of how the ancient world once was.\n\n\nCosta Rica - Land of Pure Life\nThe misty rain forests, rivers and beautiful white sand beaches of Costa Rica are home to one of the most diverse assemblages of life on Earth. Along the coast, giant crocodiles fight for the right to mate, while in the trees, troops of capuchin, squirrel and howler monkeys, as well as resplendent quetzals and beautiful songbirds, forage for food above the forest floor that is home to Hercules beetles, deadly army ants and poison dart frogs. On the sandy beaches hatchling sea turtles emerge by the thousands to race to the safety of the sea and, though few survive and reach open ocean, enough return to lay their eggs and complete the cycle of life unique to this Eden called Costa Rica.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: X264\nVideo Bitrate: 2050 KB/s\nAverage Quants:\n* I:16.50 to 17.50\n* P:17.50 to 18.50\n* B:19.00 to 20.00\nVideo Resolution 1 - 14: 640 x 464 (4:3)\nVideo Resolution 15 - 24: 688 x 368 (16:9)\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio BitRate: 128 KB/s\nAudio Channels: 2 Ch\nRunTime: 00:47\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 24\nPart Size: 744 MB\nEncoded by: gavin63\nSubtitles: No TV Cap\nSource: DVB\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Related Documentaries \n* Planet Earth\n* Greatest Places\n* The Living Planet\n\n\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Living_Edens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c424810351b739a17156096df7cc87d406dd555","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+The+Living+Edens+18of24+Costa+Rica+DVB+x264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c424810351b739a17156096df7cc87d406dd555","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,66,72,16,53,27,115,154,23,21,96,150,223,124,200,125,64,109,213,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
