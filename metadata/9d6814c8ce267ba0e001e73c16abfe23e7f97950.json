They have no children. As he is preparing to go on a vacation to the seaside, he strikes up an acquaintance with Paul (Yann Favre), a young working-class boy, and decides to bring him along. This is Paul's first glimpse of how the other half lives, with their first-class hotels and so on. When he meets some aristocratic young people at the resort, he tries to put over the fiction that he is of their class, with poor success. One of the film's highlights occurs when he confides his deception and its difficulties to Philippe. \n\nGeneral           : Les Amis - LS (1971).Xvid.avi\nFormat            : AVI at 1 114 Kbps\nLength            : 700 MiB for 1h 27mn 51s 320ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 018 Kbps\nAspect            : 640 x 384 (1.667) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 83.2 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065393/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065393/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: French\nSubtitles: Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d6814c8ce267ba0e001e73c16abfe23e7f97950","amp;dn":"Les+amis+AKA+The+Friends+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d6814c8ce267ba0e001e73c16abfe23e7f97950","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,104,20,200,206,38,123,160,224,1,231,60,22,171,254,35,231,249,121,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
