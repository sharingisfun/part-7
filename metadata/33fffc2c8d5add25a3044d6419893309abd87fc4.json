Fabrication strategies and techniques are examined next, focused on the fabrication of suitable microcomponents from various materials such as metals, polymers, silicon, ceramics and glass. The book concludes with actual applications and operational aspects of micro process systems, giving broad coverage to industrial efforts in America, Europe and Asia as well as laboratory equipment and education","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33fffc2c8d5add25a3044d6419893309abd87fc4","amp;dn":"Micro+Process+Engineering+-+Fundamentals%2C+Devices%2C+Fabrication%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33fffc2c8d5add25a3044d6419893309abd87fc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,255,252,44,141,90,221,37,163,4,77,100,25,137,51,9,171,216,127,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
