S. While similar in design and purpose to the famed Electro-Motive F40PH diesel, the F40PHL-2 model was custom-built in 1988 for South FloridaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tri-Rail commuter agency by locomotive remanufacturer Morrison-Knudsen, a firm also known as a construction and engineering company, building such famed infrastructure projects as the Hoover Dam and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. \n\nThe F40PHL-2 was built on the frames of retired Conrail GP40 locomotives, with 3,200 horsepower Electro-Motive 645-series power plants and EMD Dash 2 electronics. The unitsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 645-series engine provides power both for traction and for a HEP generator to provide electricity to its commuter consist.. To give the unique diesels a stylish exterior, Morrison-Knudsen used ex-Burlington Northern F45 cabs and carbodies. \n\nWith five F40PHL-2 diesels as motive power, Tri-Rail began operating commuter services on the Miami Ã¢â‚¬â€œ West Palm Beach route in January 1989. Initially serving with the F40PHL-2 were Bombardier-built bi-level commuter coaches and cab cars purchased from GO Transit in Canada. \n\nThe EMD F40PHL-2 for Train Simulator is available in Ã¢â‚¬ËœMiami Commuter RailÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ livery and features dynamic braking, ditch lights, and instrument lights. Bombardier bi-level commuter coaches with passenger view are also included, along with a driveable rear cabcar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a42a199a3535dc292921e6da381f19fde49cdf6e","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+Miami+Commuter+Rail+F40PHL-2+Loco+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a42a199a3535dc292921e6da381f19fde49cdf6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,42,25,154,53,53,220,41,41,33,230,218,56,31,25,253,228,156,223,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
