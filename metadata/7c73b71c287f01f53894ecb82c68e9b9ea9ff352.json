This book presents those findings in a way that will be welcomed by amateur astronomers, students, educators and anyone interested in the Moon. Enhanced by many colour photos, it combines newly acquired scientific understanding with detailed descriptions and labelled photographic maps of the lunar surface. Guided by observation methods explained in the book and 17 Study Areas presented and carefully explained in the last chapter, amateur astronomers can observe these features from Earth using telescopes and binoculars. Readers who consult the photographic maps will gain a better understanding about the MoonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s topography and geology. The book is rounded out by a helpful glossary.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c73b71c287f01f53894ecb82c68e9b9ea9ff352","amp;dn":"The+Moon+in+Close-up+%28Practical+Astronomy+Series%29+-Moore-+%5BFicti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c73b71c287f01f53894ecb82c68e9b9ea9ff352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,115,183,28,40,127,1,245,56,148,236,184,44,104,233,185,234,159,243,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
