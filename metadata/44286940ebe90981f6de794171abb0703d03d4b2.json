You fly around in a very strange \nuniverse, shoot the enemies, meet and protect the friends, \ncollect bonuses, fly through wormholes, and so on, all while \nrocking out to the music.\n\n\nYou can play the music supplied with the game or build a \nplaylist of your own songs; you can even use microphone as \nmusic source. The music animation is highly configurable \nwith multiple visualization types.\nIf shooting up stuff is not your thing, maybe you'll like \nusing it in editor mode to create unique fractal artwork. \nOr you can set the difficulty to none and concentrate on \nall the non-killing action and enjoying the beauty.\nThe Polynomial features an innovative scoring system. \nScoring is based on continuously timed counts of your \nactions in the past 1, 5, 20, and 60 minutes of your \nplay, as well as on how much you can do in the space \nof one lifetime without being killed. If you are playing \nfor the score and you screw up early, you can just keep on \nplaying ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ thanks to the unique continuous scoring. All of \nthe timed counts are running simultaneously and your scores \nare constantly updated.\nThere are multiple scoreboards for different types of action, \nas well as a combined score which rewards you for balanced \nplay. Conversely, if you just like flying around and don't \nlike shooting, you can try top the scoring in just the flowers \nyou have collected or wormholes you passed through and if you \nthink you are very bad at this game, you can try to get the high \nscore in number of deaths.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstall Notes:\n\n1. Run &quot;The_Polynomial_setup.exe&quot; and install the game.\n2. Play Polynomial and have fun!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTroubleshooting:\n\nATI-Users may be supposed to update their graphics driver.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44286940ebe90981f6de794171abb0703d03d4b2","amp;dn":"The+Polynomial+-+Space+of+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44286940ebe90981f6de794171abb0703d03d4b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,40,105,64,235,233,9,129,246,222,121,65,113,171,176,112,61,3,212,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
