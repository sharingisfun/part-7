And quite rare too. Artur Schnabel is the first pianist to record Beethoven's piano work in its entirety, starting in the 30's. Now that might seem ancient - and it is - but the remastering work from Dante (the label) is impressive and makes the whole thing listenable (now it is still a pre-war recording so don't expect crystal clear sound: there is a permanent white noise in the background).\r\nThe way Schnabel plays may seem fuzzy and not very clear, but the expressiveness is overwhelming and some parts of dazzling speed. Plus it is a considerable historical legacy!\r\n\r\n* Technicals \r\nTotal duration - 15h 55m 15s\r\nAverage bitrate - 271 kbps\r\nEncoder - FLAC 1.3.1, lossless, compression level 5\r\n\r\n\r\n* Tracks\r\nJust too many to list here! Basically everything Beethoven did for piano. If you don't mind you can see in details on Amazon here:\r\n(there seem to be other editions, but this link shows the exact box set you'll find in this torrent)\r\n\r\n///.....................................................\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to Caudheur's Classical Catalog (CCC)!\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a pretty decent collection of classical music, encoded in lossless format (FLAC).\r\n\r\nI will start to upload as much as I can, because I believe great works of art should be shared for all mankind  :)\r\n\r\nI also take requests, and remarks to improve my torrents (it's my first time creating torrents)!\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish you a pleasant listening, and don't forget to seed so that Music lives on","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61a0f22ca458ff9914129d1fcc3a81fac9006e2f","amp;dn":"Beethoven+-+Piano+Works+-+Schnabel+%281932-47%2C+Dante%29+%5B14+CDs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61a0f22ca458ff9914129d1fcc3a81fac9006e2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,160,242,44,164,88,255,153,20,18,157,31,204,58,129,250,201,0,110,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
