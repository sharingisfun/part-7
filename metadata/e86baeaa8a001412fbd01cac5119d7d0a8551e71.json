Make sure you watch the video tutorial on how to setup your Photoshop file as well as in-depth customization techniques.\r\nTIP: For really crisp details, scale your photo into the range of 2500 â€“ 4500px. The line work will appear much finer on high resolution photos. For example, if you open your photo and its size is 1500Ã—2500px â€“ then scale it upto 2500Ã—3500px or higher.\r\n\r\nThe action has been tested and working on Photoshop CS4,CS5,CS6,CC+\r\n\r\nThe action will ONLY WORK IN THE ENGLISH VERSION OF PHOTOSHOP . If you are not using the English version of Photoshop, you can always change it to English and then back again to your native language using this method.\r\n\r\n[b]Information: [/b]http://graphicriver.net/item/flex-photoshop-action/15265837","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e86baeaa8a001412fbd01cac5119d7d0a8551e71","amp;dn":"GraphicRiver+-+Flex+Photoshop+Action+15265837","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e86baeaa8a001412fbd01cac5119d7d0a8551e71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,107,174,170,138,0,20,18,251,208,28,172,81,25,215,208,168,85,30,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
