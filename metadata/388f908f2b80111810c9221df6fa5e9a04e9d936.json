Unlike Brass' monumental work, Mattei's atrocity has Caligula die about halfway through, continuing the story into the reign of Claudius until he tires of his disgraceful wife Messalina and has her put to the sword. The film is, then, more the story of Messalina than of Caligula, although you wouldn't know it from the set-up, which simply retreads the familiar Caligula story, beginning with some appallingly clunking exposition speeches, the best that can be said about which is that what they expose is then shown on screen, making them not only poor scriptwriting but staggeringly redundant.\n\nThe story is enlivened by Mattei's trademark use of stock footage, which means that intermixed with the cheap and cheerless original film are crowd scenes, senate scenes and gladiatorial scenes from early 1960s peplum, including Pontius Pilate and Leone's The Colossus of Rhodes. As usual with Mattei, the stock footage stands out like a sore thumb, or in this case is like a perfect hand on which his own sore thumb has been stuck. Not content with chivvying things up in this fashion, Mattei provides us with not one but two scenes of equine congress in quick succession Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the ass's milk for Messalina's bath is helped along by bringing in a long-donged mule to tup the ass, and Caligula's famous senator horse is shown in congress with a mare at the stables,; both scenes include explicit footages of the animal's sexual organs, the latter sequence intercutting footage from Borowczyk's The Beast. Both sequences are about as unnecessary as can be imagined, but they do perk the jaded interest after what has been a fairly dull first 45 minutes.\n\nAfter this, things get better as Caligula is killed and the story is a little bit less familiar. Messalina, now Claudius' Empress, craves nothing more than huge dick, and is serviced by her well-hung eunuch before skipping down the brothel to try the legendarily huge member of an out-of-towner client (played by the ugliest man to ever hit the screen, Salvatore Baccaro from The Beast in Heat). There's an amusing episode where the Empress feeds a lover to the lions, but the film is for the most part pretty flat, poorly acted and unimaginatively directed, so apart from the outrÃƒÂ© elements, there's little to engage, and most viewers I should think will be pretty relieved when Messalina meets her end, allowing the film to.\n\n\nScreenshots &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/pp32g7143/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/pp32g7143/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/4pmyoozfn/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/4pmyoozfn/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ebgj4zqlf/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ebgj4zqlf/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/mpw5t2rmr/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/mpw5t2rmr/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/5mosjtlk3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/5mosjtlk3/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/5mosjtlk3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/5mosjtlk3/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/60q4jf5nn/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/60q4jf5nn/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:388f908f2b80111810c9221df6fa5e9a04e9d936","amp;dn":"Caligula+and+Messalina+%281981%29+-+Classic+sex+movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"388f908f2b80111810c9221df6fa5e9a04e9d936","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,143,144,143,43,128,17,24,16,201,34,29,246,250,94,154,4,233,217,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
