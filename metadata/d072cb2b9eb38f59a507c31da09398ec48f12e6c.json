The book reframes the concept of developmentally supportive care to trauma-informed, age-appropriate care of the hospitalized premature infant. Aimed at transforming NICU practice, the book links developmental care to quality standards and Joint Commission requirements. The text is also unique in its provision of engaging online learning activities that facilitate the translation of content into clinical practice, whereby the user can also earn CEUs.\n\nThe text highlights the ways in which Nightingale's tenets of nursing and Watson's theory of human caring science resonate with the its subject matter and are applied in the NICU. It includes examples of favorable outcomes associated with the protocols described in this book from practitioners in the U.S. and overseas. Additionally, the text aligns with NANN guidelines for Age Appropriate Care of the Premature and Hospitalized Infant. This book will provide the neonatal nurse/APN with best available, evidence-based caring strategies to consistently and reliably manage the trauma associated with the NICU experience and mitigate both short-term and long-term complications associated with this developmental trauma.\n\nKey Features:\n\nIntroduces cutting-edge, evidence-based care protocols proven to reduce the profound morbidities and developmental challenges of premature infants\nReframes the concept of developmentally supportive care to trauma-informed, age-appropriate care\nMeets Joint Commission requirements for age-appropriate staff education\nPresents innovative online learning activities to facilitate translation of content to clinical practice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d072cb2b9eb38f59a507c31da09398ec48f12e6c","amp;dn":"Transformative+Nursing+in+the+NICU+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d072cb2b9eb38f59a507c31da09398ec48f12e6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,114,203,43,158,179,143,89,165,7,195,29,160,147,152,236,72,241,46,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
