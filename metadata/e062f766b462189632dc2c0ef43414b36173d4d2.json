The story will conclude in ÃƒÅ¸ehemoth: Seppuku.\n\n\n\nStarfish lit the fuse. Maelstrom was the explosion. But five years into the aftermath, things aren't quite so simple as they once seemed...Lenie Clarke-rifter, avenger, amphibious deep-sea cyborg-has destroyed the world. Once exploited for her psychological addiction to dangerous environments, she emerged in the wake of a nuclear blast to serve up vendetta from the ocean floor. The horror she unleashed-an ancient, apocalyptic microbe called ÃƒÅ¸ehemoth- has been free in the world for half a decade now, devouring the biosphere from the bottom up. North America lies in ruins beneath the thumb of an omnipotent psychopath. Digital monsters have taken Clarke's name, wreaking havoc throughout the decimated remnants of something that was once called Internet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e062f766b462189632dc2c0ef43414b36173d4d2","amp;dn":"Behemoth+%3A+B-Max+by+Peter+Watts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e062f766b462189632dc2c0ef43414b36173d4d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,98,247,102,180,98,24,150,50,220,44,14,244,52,20,179,97,115,212,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
