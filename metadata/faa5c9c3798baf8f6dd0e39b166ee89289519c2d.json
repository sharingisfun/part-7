It was also released in Australia on August 30th, New Zealand on September 1st, and Germany, Austria and Switzerland on September 5th. It was released in the United States on November 18th 2008.\n\nIt was filmed during the band's two sold out shows at Wembley Stadium on Friday June 6th and Saturday June 7th 2008. The video features a combination of footage from both nights, including the second nights collaboration with very special guests, Led Zeppelin members John Paul Jones (bass guitar) and Jimmy Page (guitar).\n\nThe video was also broadcast via satellite across the UK at Vue Cinemas on June 24, 2008. The video was shown in High Definition with 5.1 surround sound, and was the same cut as the video release.\n\nThe image on the artwork was shot by the Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£20,000 aerial camera above the crowd on Friday 6 June.\n\nThe DVD was certified gold (7,500 sales) in Australia in its third week after release.\n\n\nSome songs are taken from Friday's performance and some from Saturday's. This is identifiable in two ways. One is the underwear Grohl is wearing (Red on Friday, White on Saturday) which can be seen at points in the video, and secondly any shots containing rainfall are from Saturday, as it did not rain during Friday's performance.\n\n&quot;The Pretender&quot; (Saturday) \n&quot;Times Like These&quot; (Saturday) \n&quot;No Way Back&quot; (Saturday) \n&quot;Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)&quot; (Saturday) \n&quot;Learn To Fly&quot; (Saturday) \n&quot;Long Road To Ruin&quot; (Saturday) \n&quot;Breakout&quot; (Saturday) \n&quot;Stacked Actors&quot; (Friday) \n&quot;Skin and Bones&quot; \n&quot;Marigold&quot; (Saturday) \n&quot;My Hero&quot; (Saturday) \n&quot;Cold Day in the Sun&quot; (Saturday) \n&quot;Everlong&quot; (Friday) \n&quot;Monkey Wrench&quot; (Friday) \n&quot;All My Life&quot; (Saturday) \n&quot;Rock And Roll&quot; (Saturday) \n&quot;Ramble On&quot; (Saturday) \n&quot;Best of You&quot; (Saturday) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faa5c9c3798baf8f6dd0e39b166ee89289519c2d","amp;dn":"Foo+Fighters%3A+Live+At+Wembley+Stadium---DVD+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faa5c9c3798baf8f6dd0e39b166ee89289519c2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,165,201,195,121,139,175,143,109,208,227,155,22,110,232,146,137,81,156,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
