During the years between 1947 and 1967 a musical style was born, wretched out of the Delta by Muddy Waters and his contemporaries; it grew to its astonishing and highly influential maturity, sent out musical seed pods that would land in fertile ground all over America and as far away as England, and by the end of this period was all but moribund. After Leonard Chess' death of a heart attack in 1969, the label was sold to GRT, a company that manufactured cassette tapes. Under Leonard's son Marshall Chess, GRT's version of the label tried desperately to keep up with the popular music world, and the blues sessions were scheduled further and further apart. In 1975 GRT sold the Chess catalog to All Platinum, who stopped all new recordings and turned Chess into a reissue-only label. In the early Eighties the catalog changed hands yet again, and further reissues were put out by Sugar Hill Records.\n\nThe acquisition of the complete Chess catalog by MCA in 1985 has led finally to a long overdue, careful and systematic reissue program, making the best of the Chicago blues available after a long hiatus. This, combined with the recent resurgence of interest in blues in general and Chicago blues in particular, ensures that future generations of music aficionados will have a chance to listen to and learn from the masters.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mary Katherine Aldin, August, 1992\n\n\nChess Blues is a superlative four-CD box set featuring important tracks by all the main stars of the label (Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson), as well as much previously unreleased material.
