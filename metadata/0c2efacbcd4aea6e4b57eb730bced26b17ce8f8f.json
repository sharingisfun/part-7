And now our big-eared hero is back with more edge-of-your-seat adventures: traveling from Umbrellastan to Texas Ã¢â‚¬â€ and duking it out with villains like Dr. Vulter, Pegleg Pete, and malicious miser Eli Squinch!\n\nFloyd Gottfredson, artist and writer of Mickey Mouse, turned the strip into a 100-proof cocktail of thrills, comedy, warmth, and cynicism. In this volume, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll saddle up for GottfredsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two most famous Wild West epics: a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Race for RichesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ amid rockslides and rustlers, then a dead-shot showdown with the brutal Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bat Bandit!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Back home in Mouseton, the mayhem continues when Mickey, Donald, and Goofy run a crime-fighting newspaper Ã¢â‚¬â€ and face trouble with mobsters and speeding black sedans!\n\nLovingly restored from DisneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proof sheets, High Noon at Inferno Gulch also includes more than 50 pages of rootinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-tootinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ supplementary features! YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll enjoy rare behind-the-scenes art, vintage publicity material, and vivid commentary by a pistol-packinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ posse of seasoned Disney scholars, including a Foreword by Thomas Andrae and an appreciation by the late Bill Blackbeard.\n\nWalt Disney often said that his studioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s success Ã¢â‚¬Å“all started with a Mouse.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to rediscover the wild, unforgettable personality behind the icon!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c2efacbcd4aea6e4b57eb730bced26b17ce8f8f","amp;dn":"Mickey+Mouse+Vol+3+High+Noon+at+Inferno+Gulch+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c2efacbcd4aea6e4b57eb730bced26b17ce8f8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,46,250,203,205,74,234,110,75,87,235,115,11,206,210,107,23,206,143,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
