The band currently consists of a core trio of Pat Monahan (vocals), Jimmy Stafford (guitar), and Scott Underwood (drums).\n\nWith a lineup that included original members Monahan, Stafford, Underwood, Rob Hotchkiss, and Charlie Colin, the band achieved mainstream success with its debut album, Train, which was released in 1998 with the hit &quot;Meet Virginia&quot;. Train's 2001 album, Drops of Jupiter contained the lead single &quot;Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)&quot;, which won two Grammy Awards in 2002. The album was certified double platinum in the United States and Canada and remains the band's best-selling album to date.\n\nTrain's third studio album, My Private Nation, released in 2003, was certified platinum in the United States with the hit &quot;Calling All Angels&quot;. Following the departures of Hotchkiss and Colin, the band released its fourth album, For Me, It's You in 2006, with Brandon Bush (keyboards) and Johnny Colt (bass). Despite a generally positive reception from critics, the album was commercially unsuccessful. Train then went on a three-year hiatus.\n\nIn late 2009, Train released the album Save Me, San Francisco, from which album three singlesÃ¢â‚¬â€-the RIAA 6x Platinum-certified international hit &quot;Hey, Soul Sister&quot;, &quot;If It's Love&quot; and &quot;Marry Me&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€-reached high positions on the Billboard Hot 100 at number three, 34, and 34, respectively. The album itself has been certified gold by both the RIAA and ARIA and has sold 954,000 units.[1] Since 2008, Jerry Becker (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) and Hector Maldonado (bass, guitar, percussion, backing vocals) have been touring and recording with the group around the world. \n\n\n\nEnjoy Train :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b8d42f98d0a6989ec98038e5acf916befd6c9bc","amp;dn":"Train+-+Discography+1998+-+2012+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b8d42f98d0a6989ec98038e5acf916befd6c9bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,141,66,249,141,10,105,137,236,152,3,142,90,207,145,107,239,214,201,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
