Enhanced means the bikes and ambient sounds have been boosted so you can actually hear them as well as the English commentary. The broadcasters obviously feel that it's all about the commentators and it's been getting worse every year. I played a video with standard audio track for someone and they asked me what was wrong with the sounds since they couldn't hear the motorcycles. \r\n\r\nThe volume between the Enhanced and Standard tracks can vary widely between playback devices. There's no way around that. I configured the tracks to sound balanced on my home theater system, but on my PC they aren't balanced. \r\n\r\nI've enhanced the first part of the MotoGP season (thru Brno). If there is enough interest, I'll upload a few more. My Internet upload speed is pretty slow, so it takes a while to upload files of this size.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nFormat\t\t\t\t: Matroska\r\nFile size\t\t\t: 3.32 GB\r\nDuration\t\t\t: 1h 9mn\r\nOverall bit rate mode\t\t: Variable\r\nOverall bit rate\t\t: 6881 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat\t\t\t\t: AVC\r\nBit rate\t\t\t: 5341 Kbps\r\nWidth\t\t\t\t: 1280 pixels\r\nHeight\t\t\t\t: 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio\t\t: 16:9\r\nFrame rate\t\t\t: 50.000 fps\r\nScan type\t\t\t: Progressive\r\nLanguage\t\t\t: English\r\nDefault\t\t\t\t: Yes\r\n\r\nAudio 1\r\nFormat\t\t\t\t: FLAC\r\nBit rate\t\t\t: 768 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)\t\t\t: 2 channels\r\nTitle\t\t\t\t: Enhanced\r\nLanguage\t\t\t: English\r\nDefault\t\t\t\t: Yes\r\n\r\nAudio 2\r\nFormat\t\t\t\t: AC-3\r\nBit rate\t\t\t: 384 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)\t\t\t: 2 channels\r\nTitle\t\t\t\t: MotoGP\r\nLanguage\t\t\t: English\r\nDefault\t\t\t\t: No\r\n\r\nAudio 3\r\nFormat\t\t\t\t: AC-3\r\nBit rate\t\t\t: 384 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)\t\t\t: 2 channels\r\nTitle\t\t\t\t: Ambient\r\nDefault\t\t\t\t: No","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c02decc3adde2bed5ff0083c8a94409bb81ddbb6","amp;dn":"MotoGP+2016+Round+01+Qatar+720p+50fps+Enhanced+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c02decc3adde2bed5ff0083c8a94409bb81ddbb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,45,236,195,173,222,43,237,95,240,8,60,138,148,64,155,184,29,219,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
