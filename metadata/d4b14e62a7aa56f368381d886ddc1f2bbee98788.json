His work has explored religion, politics, isolation, sexuality, and personal relationships.[1] Cohen has been inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is also a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honour. In 2011, Cohen received a Prince of Asturias Award for literature.\n\nThe critic Bruce Eder assessed Cohen's overall career in popular music by asserting that &quot;[he is] one of the most fascinating and enigmatic Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ singer/songwriters of the late '60s Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ [and] has retained an audience across four decades of music-making Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Second only to Bob Dylan (and perhaps Paul Simon) [in terms of influence], he commands the attention of critics and younger musicians more firmly than any other musical figure from the 1960s who is still working at the outset of the 21st century.&quot;[2]\n\nThe Academy of American Poets has commented more broadly on Cohen's overall career in the arts, including his work as a poet, novelist, and songwriter, stating that &quot;[Cohen's] successful blending of poetry, fiction, and music is made most clear in Stranger Music: Selected Poems and Songs, published in 1993, which gathered more than 200 of Cohen's poems Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ several novel excerpts, and almost 60 song lyrics Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ While it may seem to some that Leonard Cohen departed from the literary in pursuit of the musical, his fans continue to embrace him as a Renaissance man who straddles the elusive artistic borderlines.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSongs of Leonard Cohen 1967 (Reissued 2007)\n\n\nSongs of Leonard Cohen is the 1967 debut album of Canadian musician Leonard Cohen. It foreshadowed the future path of his career, with less success in the United States and far better in Europe, reaching #83 on the Billboard chart but achieving gold status only in 1989, while it reached #13 in UK and spent nearly a year and a half in the UK album charts.\n\nAlthough the famed record producer John Hammond (who initially signed Cohen to his contract with Columbia Records) was supposed to produce the record, he became sick and was replaced by the producer John Simon.[8] Simon and Cohen clashed over instrumentation and mixing; Cohen wanted the album to have a sparse sound, while Simon felt the songs could benefit from arrangements that included strings and horns. According to biographer Ira Nadel, although Cohen was able to make changes to the mix, some of Simon's additions &quot;couldn't be removed from the four-track master tape.&quot;[8] The instrumentalists - not credited on the album sleeve - included Chester Crill, Chris Darrow, Solomon Feldthouse and David Lindley of The Kaleidoscope, who had been recruited personally by Cohen after he saw the band play at a New York club. Backing vocals were by Nancy Priddy, who at the time was John Simon's girlfriend.\nThe album became a cult favorite in the US, as well as in the UK, where it spent over a year on the album charts.[10] Several of the songs on that first album were covered by other popular folk artists, including Joan Baez and Judy Collins.\n\n&quot;Suzanne&quot;, an ode to a &quot;half-crazy&quot; woman who lives near the St. Lawrence River in Montreal and who is capable of profound personal/spiritual connection with the song's narrator, was ranked 41st on Pitchfork Media's 'Top 200 Songs of the 1960s'.[11] The track &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot; was also featured on the list and ranked 190th.[12] Mojo has described the album as &quot;not only the cornerstone of Cohen's remarkable career, but also a genuine songwriting landmark in terms of language, thematic developments and even arrangements.&quot;\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Suzanne&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:48\n2.\t&quot;Master Song&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:55\n3.\t&quot;Winter Lady&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:15\n4.\t&quot;The Stranger Song&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:00\n5.\t&quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:32\n6.\t&quot;So Long, Marianne&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:38\n7.\t&quot;Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:55\n8.\t&quot;Stories of the Street&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:35\n9.\t&quot;Teachers&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:01\n10.\t&quot;One of Us Cannot Be Wrong&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:23\n11.\t&quot;Store Room&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:06\n12.\t&quot;Blessed Is the Memory&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:03\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4b14e62a7aa56f368381d886ddc1f2bbee98788","amp;dn":"Leonard+Cohen+-+Songs+of+Leonard+Cohen+1967+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4b14e62a7aa56f368381d886ddc1f2bbee98788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,177,78,98,167,170,86,243,104,56,29,136,109,220,31,43,190,233,135,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
