He has also contributed to several collaborative albums \nwith the groups Deepspace5 and Labklik, both of which he is a founding member of.\n\nWith his second release Ozark Empire in 2005, Dan began his first &quot;Tour of Homes&quot;. This consisted almost entirely of \ntraveling from home to home around the United States (the European leg of the tour was titled the &quot;European Tour of \nHomes&quot;) in a grassroots style of touring. The European leg consisted more of performing in standard live music venues \nas well as houses, coffee shops, art galleries and warehouses.[5] It was also during this period that Smith invited \ndrummer Andrew Gibbens and guitarist Erik Olsen to join him on tour, thus starting the transition away from \ntraditional hip-hop performances toward a live band format. Gibbens and Olsen remained until they departed the band \nin December 2006. Regardless of using the name Listener for his solo work, Smith decided to continue using the name \nas the project developed in to a live band.\n\nIt was during the Tour of Homes in 2005 that Dan met musician Christin Nelson at a house show in Las Vegas, \nNevada. After finding out that Christin played drums, Dan asked him to join the group in June 2007 and the band \nreleased the album Return to Struggleville.\n\nAfter a year and a half of touring, Listener released their third studio album, Wooden Heart, in July 2010. Later that \nyear after being introduced to the band The Chariot, Dan was asked to collaborate on the song &quot;David De La Hoz&quot; on the \nalbum Long Live.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           We pillage, we plunder we rifle and loot\n                It's a pirate's life for me\n                   Drink up, me hearties\n\t\t\t\n                       _____|____\n                      | Ph1l0s0phy|\n\t\t      |     1s    |\n\t\t      |\t   D34d   |\n                      |.----||----.\n                        .---''---,\n                         ;..__..'    _...\n                       ,'/  ;|/..--''    \n                     ,'_/.-/':            :\n                _..-'''/  /  |         _|/|\n                     /-./_ ;       ,;'   \n               ,    / :  `:       //    `:`.\n             ,'    /-._;   | :    : ::    ,.   .\n           ,'     ::   /`-._| |    | || ' :  `.`.)\n        _,'       |;._:: |  | |    | `|   :    `'\n      ,'   `.     /   |`-:_ ; |    |  |  : \n      `--.   )   /|-._:    :          |    \n         /  /   :_|   ;`-._;   __..--';    : :\n        /  (    ;|;-./_  _/.-:'o |   /     ' |\n       /  , ._/_/_./--''/_|:|___|_,'        |\n      :  /   `'-'--'----'---------'          |\n      | :     O ._O   O_.
