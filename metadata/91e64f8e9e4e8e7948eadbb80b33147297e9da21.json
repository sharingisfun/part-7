Go for it! :D\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThe Situational Judgement Test at a Glance provides a sound introduction to the SJT and details ways you can prepare before the assessment. It includes worked case examples based on real-life scenarios which have been reviewed by experienced clinicians and examiners. The book draws out key aspects of professional practice relevant to the role of a junior doctor. This is based on the nine domains as outlined by the ISFP (Improving Selection to Foundation Programme), who detailed the behaviours necessary to be a competent Foundation Doctor.\n\nThe overall aim of The Situational Judgement Test at a Glance is not to spoon feed hundreds of practice questions or reams of guidelines, but to steer you towards a logical way of approaching best medical practice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and therefore the SJT Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with many examples of doctors' personal experiences along the way.\n\nChallenging scenarios are analysed using guidelines from the General Medical Council and research interviews with patients, lab staff and healthcare professionals. All examples in the book are worked in a test-style apparatus, with questions on one side and detailed answers over the page so you can understand the reasoning behind the material.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91e64f8e9e4e8e7948eadbb80b33147297e9da21","amp;dn":"The+Situational+Judgement+Test+at+a+Glance+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91e64f8e9e4e8e7948eadbb80b33147297e9da21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,230,79,142,158,78,142,121,72,234,219,184,11,51,20,114,151,233,218,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
