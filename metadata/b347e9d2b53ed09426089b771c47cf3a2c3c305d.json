When Paisley sings, as he does on &quot;Celebrity&quot;, &quot;No matter what you do, people think you&amp;#039;re cool just &amp;#039;cuz you&amp;#039;re on TV,&quot; he ratifies his status as a formidable voice in modern yet accessible and traditional country music. &quot;That&amp;#039;s Love&quot; and &quot;Is It Raining at Your House&quot; offer romance freed of hazy metaphor or greeting-card slogans. There&amp;#039;s a miniature morality play, &quot;The Cigar Song&quot;, and the obligatory closing gospel chestnut (&quot;Farther Along&quot;). The guest shots--by contemporary stars Alison Krauss and Vince Gill, and veterans Bill Anderson, George Jones and Little Jimmy Dickens--are pleasant but hardly necessary, since Paisley&amp;#039;s good musical sense abounds. He also revives a long-vanished tradition: the featured sideman. As Chet Atkins once played for the Carter Sisters and Don Rich picked behind Buck Owens, Paisley spotlights his amazing guitarist, Merle Haggard alumnus Redd Volkaert. He rips loose on &quot;Spaghetti Western Swing&quot; and flies free on the extended country-jazz jam in the middle of &quot;Make a Mistake with Me&quot;.\n\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n?
