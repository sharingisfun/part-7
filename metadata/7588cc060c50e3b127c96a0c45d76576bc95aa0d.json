While the latter present limited, sanitized and artificial-looking depictions of life under the Nazi rule, Romm's &quot;Ordinary Fascism&quot; pulls out all the stops in its selection of documentary material to draw the viewer not only into absolute horror about fascism and nazism in the 1920s-1940s Europe, but also to a firmest of convictions that nothing of the sort should be allowed to happen again anywhere in the world.\n\nNote the timing: the film was released in 1965, in the Soviet Union's heyday at the height of the great societal and intellectual &quot;thaw&quot; that followed the Stalin's death and the denunciation of Stalin's totalitarianism by Nikita Khruschev. Never explicitly mentioning any of them explicitly, the film targets tyranny and despotism no matter what form they may take; the release of such a film would have been impossible under Stalin.\n\nA good indicator of the power of this film could be the fact that it is available in most video stores in Germany\nAdditional Information:\nExtra Info: Director: Mikhail Romm\nWriters: Yuri Khanyutin, Mikhail Romm.\nStars: Mikhail Romm, Marlene Dietrich and Josef Goebbels.\nNarrator: Mikhail Romm\n\nSome notes on RommÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s biography:\n\nMikhail Romm was born in 1901, into a Russian-Jewish family, in the Siberian city of Irkutsk, Russia. He served in the Red Army in 1918-21 as an Inspector of the Special Forces for Food Supplies. He was in charge of confiscations of bread and food from the wealthier farmers (kulaks) in Central Russia. Romm later was avoiding any discussions regarding this painful memories, though he used his experience in the films about Lenin...\n\nExtra Info: Feel free to upload this film everywhere you can or want.
