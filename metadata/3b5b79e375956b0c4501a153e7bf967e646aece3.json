The early artists, van Eyck and Van der Weyden, were instrumental in perfecting the techniques of oil painting and exploiting its potential, especially in portraiture. In this book from the Phaidon Colour Plate Series, Anthea Peppin and William Vaughan describe this key period of art history and illustrate its development with 48 colour plates that range chronologically from Campin's &quot;The Nativity&quot;, c. 1430, to van Dyck's &quot;Equestrian Portrait of Charles I&quot;, late 1630s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b5b79e375956b0c4501a153e7bf967e646aece3","amp;dn":"Flemish+Painting+%28Phaidon+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b5b79e375956b0c4501a153e7bf967e646aece3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,91,121,227,117,149,107,12,69,1,161,83,231,191,150,126,100,106,236,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
