From the ferocity of the CD's twin guitar assault to its pulsating rhythm section, every detail of the CD's sonic presentation is scrutinized down to the smallest detail. By the time Big Dad Ritch's snarling vocal is placed into the final mix, all that's left for the listener to do is wonder why there aren't more CDs this good.\n\nWith the combination of it's sound quality, songwriting and passionate performances, the Texas Hippie Coalition's 1st offering will most certainly be an interesting one to follow throughout the course of 2008 and beyond.\nGenre:\tThrash\nSubgenre:\tSouthern / Half-Thrash Metal / Hard Rock\nBitrate:\tVbr\nSize:\t64.44 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n10 files\n1.
