From the seed first planted by slave dances held in Congo Square and nurtured by early ensembles led by Buddy Belden and Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver, jazz began its long winding odyssey across America and around the world, giving flower to a thousand different formsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½swing, bebop, cool jazz, jazz-rock fusionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and a thousand great musicians. Now, in The History of Jazz, Ted Gioia tells the story of this music as it has never been told before, in a book that brilliantly portrays the legendary jazz players, the breakthrough styles, and the world in which it evolved.\n\nTable of Contents \nTitle Page \nContents \nOne: The Prehistory of Jazz \nTwo: New Orleans Jazz \nThree: The Jazz Age \nFour: Harlem \nFive: The Swing Era \nSix: Modern Jazz \nSeven: The Fragmentation of Jazz Styles \nEight: Freedom and Beyond \nNotes \nFurther Reading \nRecommended Listening \nAcknowledgments \nIndex \nIndex of Songs and Albums \n\n\nTed Gioia (born October 21, 1957) is a noted jazz critic and music historian, best known for his books The History of Jazz and Delta Blues, both selected as notable books of the year by The New York Times.
