The goal of the workshops is to survey recent progress in combinatorial number theory and related parts of mathematics. The workshop attracts researchers and students who discuss the state-of-the-art, open problems and future challenges in number theory.\n\nPublisher: Springer; 2014 edition (14 December 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1493916009\nISBN-13: 978-1493916009","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e74211d2d2f32010468d3ee9e8ab00b15dfd9ae3","amp;dn":"Combinatorial+and+Additive+Number+Theory+CANT+2011+and+2012%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e74211d2d2f32010468d3ee9e8ab00b15dfd9ae3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,66,17,210,210,243,32,16,70,141,62,233,232,171,0,177,93,253,154,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
