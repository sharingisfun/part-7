When the mortal Sophia - recovering from an eye operation and virtually blind - needs a home healthcare worker, he takes on the role, hoping she will be his ticket home.\n\nWhile defending Sophia from an unknown adversary, Triton's protective instinct emerges. At the same time rival Gods do everything to doom him to failure. And even if Triton can win Sophia's love, will he throw it away to return home, or will he lose his own heart to the only woman who truly sees him?\n\nA Touch of Greek is the first book in the humorous paranormal romance series Out of Olympus following the romantic adventures of four Gods: Triton, Dionysus, Eros, and Hermes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c9d9f1f272ee3c37f5d3a781a9ffa07d5d93b8f","amp;dn":"A+Touch+of+Greek+-+Tina+Folsom+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c9d9f1f272ee3c37f5d3a781a9ffa07d5d93b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,157,159,31,39,46,227,195,127,93,58,120,26,159,250,7,213,217,59,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
