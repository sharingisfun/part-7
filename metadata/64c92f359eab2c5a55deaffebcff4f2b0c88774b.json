For nearly three weeks, we desperately tried to recover the entire lost data. Here again, the Pirate Bay was very helpful. We downloaded books on registry, and tried several disc recovery software. Finally, we salvaged the partial data thanks to the great and helpful torrents. Thereafter, the repairing of the original data and re-editing had to be done. \n \nFirst, we wish to express our gratitude to The Pirate Bay, the seeders, and the supporters. TPB is the last stand of intellectual freedom in the world. It is an indispensable source of uncensored information.\nWe have had incalculable benefit since we joined the Pirate Bay. Many seeders from various backgrounds have made their contributions to the international community. May the Universe bless you all, with knowledge, riches, genuine love and freedom. \nSecond, we express our profound regard for the courageous heroes, the two Founders of TPB who are unjustly deprived of their freedom.\nThe Pirate Bay has helped millions of poor people who cannot afford educational materials and have no access to them in local libraries. Families and children have also had access to beautiful films. Rare, difficult to obtain, classical books and films are available on The Pirate Bay. TPB is the Light that shines the world to enlighten humanity.\nMay the Founders of The Pirate Bay obtain the Freedom that is rightly theirs as quickly as possible.\nWe humbly release the authentic English translation of The Wind Rises, from Blue Ray rip. \nThere were some typographical mistakes and poor synchronisation in the previous Avi version. In this revised version, the technical terms used in the aerodynamic specifications have been updated. \nDetailed information regarding the names of locations has been added to enable the audience to consult maps of Japan and know where the story is unfolding.\nTranslation of the posters and sign plates has been added to enhance the appreciation of the scenes. \nNo maestro can produce a perfect work. As stated before, the male voice of the protagonist did not move the audience, as one British journalist stated. In the voice-over, the spirit that  the words are said in is important. One famous voice-over artist in Japan stated that,\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœIn the texts that I speak, the soul is going into the words.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n Here the said artist uses the word Ã¢â‚¬ËœKoto-damaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the spirit of word. This is a very ancient concept that the soul resides in words, and was part of the original tenets of Shinto.\nThe word is a living entity. Words can kill. Words can heal. \n\n3+3+3 = 9 AND ITS ESOTERIC CONNECITON\nAt the nuptials, the bridegroom and the bride also perform rituals that relate to the numbers 3 and 9. Three has always had an esoteric significance, both in the West and the East. Nine relates to the Navagraha, the nine planets that influence the destiny of living entities on earth. As for three, the sacred objects enshrined in the Shinto shrine are three, namely, Sphere, Mirror and Sword, representing Creation, Maintainance and Destruction of the Cosmic circle.\nThe KurokawasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ crisp and medieval style speech was close to the style in which Bushi (Samurai) spoke in medieval Japan. Without any unnecessary words, it is like military communication. Miyazaki hinted that the Kurokawa, in the way that their residence was depicted, were descendants of Bushi. The way JiroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parental home was portrayed and his motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hairstyle also implied he was a Bushi descendant.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF AUTHENTICITY.\nThe Japanese and an American voice over artists who are imitating Italiano, Francais, Deutsch have done very bad job. The dictation makes the words almost unintelligible, native speakers should have been chosen.  \nOne of the commercial translators who added the subtitles was Japanese, however, that individual has obviously no knowledge of classical Japanese. They failed completely to convey the subtleties of communication that underlines the beauty of this film. As Miyazaki said, this film was aimed mainly at people who are over 40. The classical Japanese spoken in the period being portrayed needs to be translated into a formal style of English. It is MiyazakiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s farewell piece, and the world audience deserves the best translation. \nCorruption of languages leads to the corruption of cultures, thus, it is important that each culture preserves their language in its unadulterated form. English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, when we hear the very polite forms of traditional speech spoken by the natives while we visit their countries, we are thrilled. \n\nWATCH YOUR BREATH.\n\nDespite the conversation in the film is Japanese, the audience of TPB can deduce many things by listening to a good voice-over artist like Ms Takimoto. By listening to the tone, breathing and inflections, we can sense the feeling of the speakers. \nHumans think first in images. We learn to put values after the school education starts, thereby killing the original creativity we all have. After the end of university years, we are all programmed to obey and execute the task, not a creative genius we all were born to be.  Thus, the Establishment comes after anyone like TPB founders, who rock the boat. Ladies and gentlemen, let us rock the boat and shake off our conditioning.\nThe knowledge of the words meaning is not an absolute must. Humans sense emotion, intent and meaning in more than merely words. A great percentage of our communication is non-verbal. Meta-level communication is vital to sense and analyse the other humans, especially detecting the evil people.\nIf one were truly in tune with the othersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ breath, one can know when to attack and defeat the opponent at once. It is part of Budo training, taught by the genuinely last Samurai, Masutatsu Oyama. Breath is so important. Breath and mind, breath and health, breath and emotion are all linked together. When Ms Takimoto (NaokoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice) speaks, she conveys exactly the emotion needed. There was such a talent still existed in Japanese acting world. \n\nLOVE AND LIKE\n\nBefore she leaves Jiro, she whispers, Ã¢â‚¬ËœJiro-san, dai-suki-yo.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ This literally means Ã¢â‚¬ËœJiro, I like you big.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ When Japanese women express their highest feeling of affection, they use Ã¢â‚¬ËœlikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, not Ã¢â‚¬ËœloveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nTherefore, what she says is much stronger than Ã¢â‚¬ËœI love you.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ There is no way to translate NaokoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strong love for her beloved, thus it was translated as Ã¢â‚¬ËœJiro, I always love you.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Blessed are the men who have heard such words from women, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.\nOne can tell Takimoto (Naoko) has memorised her text while Anno (Jiro) has not, but reading without fully having comprehended it. No human speaks so monotonously unless he is reading from a pre prepared text out loud. Anno reads as if he were in the classroom. Takimoto really saved the movie, together with the superb musical score of Jo Hisaishi.\n\nNOT A WAR MOVIE.\nSome critic said this is a glorification of Japanese militarism. \nWe have no interest in fighter-jets, battleships and military. The winners in the war are the Establishment who order commoners to fight. Of course, the military-industrial complex that supplies the war machine also benefit financially thus they want us to die for them. \nWe do not believe in politics or war, and agree with Albert Einstein who said Ã¢â‚¬Ëœnationalism is for the infantile mindsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nOur motivation comes solely from the utterly disappointing English dubbing and subtitles. It is an insult to translate the beautiful interaction between characters in the way the commercial translators have. If the same company did a similar disservice to Maupassant or MoliereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s works, the French would be not quiet.\n\nREAL NAOKO, FUYU-NO-HANA-YUKO.\n\nThere is a similar real story that took place during the time of Jiro and Satomi written by the author and playwright Keinosuke Uekusa. It is a real story.\nWhen UekusaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s close friend, who was not physically fit, receives a draft order (Akagami) to join the Japanese army, Uekusa realises he will soon be called up.\nHe decides to visit the Red Light district. There he meets Yuko, a woman from the Tohoku region, who was sold to pay her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debts. Her family were tenant farmers in a dire economic situation suffering from hunger and poverty. Thus sold as a sex slave, she was in Yoshiwara, todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Asakusa district in central Tokyo.\nYuko was a bright woman. When she was young, she attended a small church in her locality, and she remembers many hymns and sings very well. Uekusa, being an intellectual man, is soon attracted to her as she is not only beautiful, she is also bright and pure hearted. When he met Yuko, she was beginning to show the first signs of having contracted tuberculosis. This greatly concerned Uekusa.  \nAn intellectual who has never fought in his life, he decides to risk lynching by the yakuza and assist Yuko to escape from Yoshiwara. When woman were caught trying to escape before  they got out of Yoshiwara, they were tortured, branded with a hot rod iron, and deprived of food for days.\nUekusa and Yuko succeed in escaping. They have the most beautiful time for about three months before the brothel and its yakuza guards find out where Yuko and Uekusa live.\nWhile Uekusa is out, Yakuza come and abduct Yuko.\nWhen Uekusa comes to know what has happened, he places a  newspaper advertisement in the national dailies to try to find  Yuko. For months, he keeps placing the advertisements. Finally, nearly a year later, Uekusa receives a letter, which has many tearstains and blurred ink. \nIt was from Yuko. She knew Uekusa had been looking for her for a long time, but because she wanted him to succeed in his career as a writer and playwright, and knowing that her life would be short, she did not contact him until her death was approaching. If you read this story, you know the mind of traditional Japanese women. Naoko left Jiro because her mission to give support to Jiro ended when Jiro succeeded, and also she wanted to give Jiro beautiful memories, and not to become burden when she was certain to deteriorate.\nWhen Uekusa rushed to the dingy brothel in Nagoya to which Yuko was re-sold, she was bedridden and had been left to die in a dusty attic.\nUekusa takes Yuko to the Salvation Army Hospital in Suginami, Tokyo. There is no teaching of religious charity in Shinto and Buddhism in Japan, therefore the physicians and hospitals did not take patients without money then, and now, there was and are no free-clinics as there are in Western countries. \nShe dies one week after her beloved came to her rescue.  After that, Uekusa always carried her ashes with him till his death later.  Such love did exist, and hope still exist in the world.\n\nDO YOU HAVE THIS VHS RECORD?\nIf there is someone who has the VHS recording of this dramatization of Ã¢â‚¬ËœFuyu no Hana YukoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, kindly seed it to TPB so that someone can add authentic subtitles. The protagonist was played by a beautiful Japanese actress Yukiyo Toake. \n\nFUMIKI WATANABE\n\nMiyazaki did as he could to snipe at Japanese Establishement. But there is another film director working in Japan today doing straightforward and being persecuted.\nDirector Fumiki Watanabe has won the Japan Directors Association award, and makes very well researched movies like Ã¢â‚¬ËœEmperor MythÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœOsutaka-yama (Mt Osutaka) on other taboo subjects in Japan.\nHe is doing a service to Japan by making films on important subjects for the Japanese to consider. After WW2, the Japanese did not reflect upon the underlying causes of the disastrous course the Nation took. He is neither Left nor Right wing. He is truly a Japanese man who speaks the truth and needs to be known to the world. Without TPB circulate his works, he may be buried under the carpet.\nUnfortunately, many Japanese do not know what is really going on in the world due to their lack of language ability. This leads to an inability to appreciate intellectual thought in foreign countries, especially the important political thinking that let to Western parliamentary democracies and the law in relation to equality.\nThe successors of TOKKO are doing everything to prevent Director Watanabe showing his films in Japan. Watanabe has been constantly harassed by Ko-an, (public safety police, the successors of TOKKO). He can only infrequently show his films in Japanese theatres, because of pressures from the Japanese Establishment, no theatre shows his films. His wife, and his only daughter live in financial difficulty yet they never stop making great films. Why Japanese Establishment is so eager to supress? Is there anything they are afraid that the people of the world come to know?\nImdb has his profile. He is one of the very few active people in Japan who speak the truth, and act as the conscience of Japan. The world cannot let him down. Will you?\nIf anyone has any of his films, kindly seed them. Alternatively, if someone can contact him, let him know that he needs to upload to TPB so that his works do not perish, but shall be preserved in the minds of the world community. \nTrue Samurai never invades neighbouring countries and exploit women for sexual slaves. Lack of Bushi-do, lack of true Samurai led the ruin of Japan. Carrying the sword does not make anyone Samurai. Japanese politicians are worst enemies of Japan. Also by keeping silence and looking the other way, majority of Japanese people share the guilt. True Samurai fight what is right and just in the eyes of Creator.\nSomeone shall surely add English subtitles for the global audience. Seed Director WatanabeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s works, someone!.\n\nSO YOU THINK JAPAN IS A MODERN COUNTRY?\n\nDue to unwritten censorship, many important and talented people in Japan cannot flourish if they take up matters that run counter to the official line. Mr Miyazaki said that Ã¢â‚¬Ëœnowadays, NHK (State Television) and NTV (private behemoth) tell Ghibli that certain matters cannot be touched upon in their movies. \nSo you, the international community, now know, when Kurokawa says Ã¢â‚¬Ëœso you thought Japan is a modern countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in reality, Mr Miyazaki is telling us, that todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Japan has the same mentality, the same people in charge at the highest echelon of Japanese society, who lead Japan into disaster.\n\nKNOW THE FACTS.\n\nLastly, in order to understand Kamikaze, and Japan, it is necessary to read Ã¢â‚¬ËœJapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Imperial ConspiracyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ by David Bergamini. He was a Rhodes scholar. It is a monumental book. What happened before shall happen again. History repeats itself.\nPeople who ordered young pilots to die for Japan remained in the Japanese Establishment. They are in charge today as well.\n\nThis movie is not just a war movie or a romance, the message is much more subtle. Think why Miyazaki put the dialogue, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ the world with pyramid and without pyramid?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢  Do you think he means the monument in Egypt? No. It is a very deep subject.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœJustice, justice shalt thou pursue, so that thou mayest live.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœWhen a man dies, he cannot carry anything with him, only his merits and demerits accompanies himÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœDharma protected shall protect the one who protected DharmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nMay the Universe Bless you all.\n\nP.S. ,\n\nWir stimmen nicht mit der Auslegung der Ursache des Krieges ÃƒÂ¼berein, die von Miyazaki angedeutet wird.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64c92f359eab2c5a55deaffebcff4f2b0c88774b","amp;dn":"The+WInd+Rises+Kaze+Tachinu+The+Authentic+Version+British+Englis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64c92f359eab2c5a55deaffebcff4f2b0c88774b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,201,47,53,158,171,44,90,85,222,175,254,188,255,79,43,12,136,119,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
