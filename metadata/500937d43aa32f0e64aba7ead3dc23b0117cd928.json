We are in the Era of Behavior and the rules of the game have fundamentally changed. It is no longer what you do that matters most and sets you apart from others, but how you do what you do. Whats are commodities, easily duplicated or reverse-engineered.

In HOW: Why HOW We Do Anything Means Everything, Dov Seidman shares his unique approach with you.
