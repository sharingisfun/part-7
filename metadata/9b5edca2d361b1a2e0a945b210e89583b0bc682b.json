Sticking to bop standards, Clark essentially plays his version of Bud Powell, carving out his own approach to the influential style. The CD reissue adds three alternates to the six selections and includes such gems as &quot;Two Bass Hit,&quot; &quot;Be-Bop&quot; and &quot;Tadd's Delight.&quot; ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nSonny Clark always chose the best sidemen, when he led a recording session. Like on his marvellous quintet album &quot;Cool Struttin&quot;, on bass and drums we have the very best musicians of their time, namely Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones, so be prepared for some great music.  Though also known as a good composer, here Sonny Clark concentrates on bop standards written by Gillespie or Dameron.  It's quite interesting to compare his version of &quot;Be-Bop&quot; with Bud Powell's interpretations of that tune. You will notice, that Clark cannot be called one of those numerous Powell imitators, he's got a different, more &quot;funky&quot; touch and phrasing.  About the other tunes on that album, just let me say, that I was surprised to hear his romantic solo version of &quot;I Remember April&quot;, usually played at fast tempo. &quot;One Bass Hit&quot; also is quite a surprise with Clark choosing the original big-band arrangement of that tune with it's change of the key from C-major into D-flat for solos.  Really a most enjoyable trio-album. ~ G.
