The first country song by either artist, it was nominated for Vocal Event Of The Year at the 2003 Country Music Awards.\n\n   When Atlantic Records was originally unable to get permission from Crow's record label to release the song as a single, a new version was recorded with Allison Moorer singing Crow's part.\n\n   &quot;Picture&quot; was later included on Crow's greatest hits album The Very Best of Sheryl Crow released in 2003. As of 2008, the original album version of &quot;Picture&quot; can be heard on most country, hot adult contemporary, soft adult contemporary and adult album alternative radio stations, replacing the pop and country radio edit versions.\n\n  \n    Being the third Kid Rock single that entered Billboard's Hot 100 chart, &quot;Picture&quot; remains his most successful single to date in the United States, peaking at number 4. The song even charted on the Hot Country Songs, peaking at number 21. Until 2008's &quot;All Summer Long&quot;, it also marked his only Top 40 country hit. The song is also Sheryl Crow's second-most successful single in the United States to date, after her 1994 hit &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; which reached number 2.\n\n\n                                ***Picture.***\n\n\n                                    Enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:793cb52c76ccd39901f5fd9a7da219cdfb7a7a5d","amp;dn":"Kid+Rock+Ft+Sheryl+Crow-Picture%282003%29%28Full+%26+Clean%29-Wushan.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"793cb52c76ccd39901f5fd9a7da219cdfb7a7a5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,60,181,44,118,204,211,153,1,245,253,154,125,162,25,205,251,122,122,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
