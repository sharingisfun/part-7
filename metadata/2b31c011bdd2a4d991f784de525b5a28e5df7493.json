He is joined by leading writers and film-makers, who tell the inside story of their best-known works.\n\nIn this first episode, Dominic looks at science fiction's enduring fascination with outer space, from Jules Verne's pioneering 19th-century vision of a voyage to the moon to the galaxy far, far away of Star Wars.\n\nAlong the way we learn what Star Trek has in common with the British navy, the deep sea inspiration for Avatar, how Ursula K Le Guin captured the 1960s sexual revolution in her acclaimed novel The Left Hand of Darkness, how Stanley Kubrick made 2001: A Space Odyssey seem so believable, and why a man in a dressing gown became one of science fiction's best-loved heroes in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nAmong the interviewees are William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols (Star Trek), Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker (Star Wars), Zoe Saldana (Avatar) and author Neil Gaiman.\n\n===================================================================================\nSource.......: HDTV\nRipper.......: marxph\nSize.........: 340MB\nDuration.....: 00:59:12\nFormat.......: mp4\nResolution...: 640x360\nVideo........: h.264, 703Kbps @ 25 fps\nAudio........: aac, 93Kbps, 48 KHz, 2 channels\n===================================================================================\n\nghost dog","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b31c011bdd2a4d991f784de525b5a28e5df7493","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Unearthly+History+of+Science+Fiction+-+1.+Space+HDTV+x26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b31c011bdd2a4d991f784de525b5a28e5df7493","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,49,192,17,189,210,164,217,145,247,132,222,82,91,90,40,229,223,116,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
