Formed in 1992 and retired in 1997, Stone Sour played soulful, metallic hard rock in the vein of Alice in Chains, traces of which later appeared in looser, guitar-oriented Slipknot numbers like &quot;Left Behind.&quot; The album opener, &quot;Get Inside,&quot; and the snaky &quot;Choose&quot; kick with the agility of Pantera, while the mellower &quot;Monolith&quot; and &quot;Blue Study&quot; rely on Taylor's nasal vocals for emotional punch. Stone Sour probably wouldn't have made it out of Iowa in 2002 without the platinum pedigree of its erstwhile members; still, this is a respectable package of monster riffs and dynamic ideas. --Ian Christe\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Get inside                                           [03:14]\n02.Orchids                                              [04:24]\n03.Cold reader                                          [03:41]\n04.Blotter                                              [04:02]\n05.Choose                                               [04:17]\n06.Monolith                                             [03:46]\n07.Inhale                                               [04:26]\n08.Bother                                               [04:00]\n09.Blue study                                           [04:38]\n10.Take A number                                        [03:43]\n11.Idle hands                                           [03:57]\n12.Tumult                                               [04:04]\n13.Omega                                                [02:53]\n________\n51:05 min\n 85,3 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
