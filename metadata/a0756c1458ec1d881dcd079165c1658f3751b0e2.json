This photo-intensive book covers everything from dyeing with Kool-Aid to more involved processes like working with acid dyes and hand-painting. Concealed wiro binding allows the book to lay flat--perfect for undertaking projects with wet or dye-covered hands. Barbara Parry (Shelburne, MA) is the founder and creative vision behind Foxfire Fiber &amp; Designs. She produces her own yarn line from the wool of the sheep she raises on her farm in the Berkshire foothills, which is home to 70 sheep, two llamas, and two goats. The wool she produces is prized by knitters and handspinners and has won numerous awards. Barbara chronicles life on her farm in her blog &quot;Sheep Gal: Notes from a Shelburne Shepherd&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0756c1458ec1d881dcd079165c1658f3751b0e2","amp;dn":"Teach+Yourself+VISUALLY+Hand-Dyeing+%5BKnitting%2C+Crocheting%2C+Yarn%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0756c1458ec1d881dcd079165c1658f3751b0e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,117,108,20,88,236,29,136,29,205,7,145,101,193,101,143,55,81,176,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
