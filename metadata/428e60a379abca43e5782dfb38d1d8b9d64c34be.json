Going over the top was never what Tesla did best, and Psychotic Supper shows enough variation and occasional understatement to retain the listener's interest. Many of the band's best songs are here, including &quot;What You Give,&quot; &quot;Call It What You Want,&quot; &quot;Song and Emotion,&quot; and &quot;Edison's Medicine&quot;; the latter is perhaps the most typical of the pop-metal anthem sound, but its subject matter -- the attention paid to Thomas Edison over lesser-known genius Nikola Tesla, to whom the band is obviously devoted -- certainly qualifies it as distinctive. The guitar workout on &quot;Don't De-Rock Me&quot; is another highlight. ~ Steve Huey\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Change In the Weather 3:38 \n2 Edison's Medicine 4:46 \n3 Don't De-Rock Me 5:11     \n4 Call It What You Want 4:30 \n5 Song and Emotion 8: 28\n6 Time 5:13 \n7 Government Personne    l0:59 \n8 Freedom Slaves 6:40 \n9 Had Enough 4:49 \n10 What You Give7:15 \n11 Stir It Up5:40 \n12 Can't Stop 5:27 \n13 Toke About It 5:24 \n14 Rock The Nation 3:31 [Bonus Track]\n15 I AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Superstitious 3:12 [Bonus Track]\n16 Run Run Run 2:46 [Bonus Track]\n\n\nTesla:\n J.T.
