At the Prehistoric Autopsy HQ in Glasgow, with the help of a team of international experts, each episode follows the rebuilding of one of our most iconic ancient ancestors from the bones up.\n\n\n\n\n3)  Lucy \nThis episode looks at probably the most famous of all our early ancestors. She is called Lucy from the species Australopithecus afarensis and she lived 3.2 million years ago. Lucy's species had traded life in the trees for life on the ground, but this ability to routinely walk upright came at a price and it is one we are still paying today.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1527 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 416\nVideo Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\nNumber Of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 700 MB\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by Harry65\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00xfdmt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00xfdmt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b051c0e0ffbf4053a93f7a5b6929fb1169c6314","amp;dn":"BBC+Prehistoric+Autopsy+3of3+Lucy+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b051c0e0ffbf4053a93f7a5b6929fb1169c6314","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,5,28,14,15,251,244,5,58,147,247,165,182,146,159,177,22,156,99,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
