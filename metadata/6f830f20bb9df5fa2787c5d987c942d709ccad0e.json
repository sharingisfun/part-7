This design disparity resulted in increased construction and fleet maintenance costs at a when the separate private railway companies were unified and nationalised into British Railways in 1948, so having a standard set of locomotives would minimise costs and improve efficiency in many areas.\n\nThe first steam locomotive in the Just Trains Advanced range, this is probably the most realistic steam locomotive available to date for Train Simulator and comes with a host of special Advanced features to recreate the experience of driving the real-world machine. A unique Switcher tool also allows a Simple version to be driven.\n\nThis popular Standard Class loco comes in a set of liveries and with different cabs depending on the era depicted. Also included are some Just Trains Mk.1 coaches complete with passenger view and leaking steam effect.    \n\nSupplied with eight exciting custom and Free Roam scenarios (some of which require additional routes), this Standard 4MT Advanced and Mk.1 Coaches collection will transport you back to the steam era in the most authentic and exciting way possible!\n\nSCENARIOS\n\nPlease note also that not all these routes are included in Train Simulator by default and are not supplied with this product\nStandard scenarios\n\n\nThe Royal Duchy (Bristol to Exeter)\nStock: Maroon (BR) Mk.1s\n\nDrive 76084 on one of 2014's 'Royal Duchy' workings, returning from Par to Bristol.
