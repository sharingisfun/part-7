His narrative takes us from Iowa cornfields to food-science laboratories, from feedlots and fast-food restaurants to organic farms and hunting grounds, always emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the handful of plant and animal species we depend on. Each time Pollan sits down to a meal, he deploys his unique blend of personal and investigative journalism to trace the origins of everything consumed, revealing what we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods and flavors reflects our evolutionary inheritance. The surprising answers Pollan offers to the simple question have profound political, economic, psychological, and even moral implications for all of us.\n\n**********************************************************************\n\nThe Botany of Desire - A Plant's-Eye View of the World\nby Michael Pollan\n\nEvery schoolchild learns about the mutually beneficial dance of the honeybees and flowers: The bee collects nectar and pollen to make honey and, in the process, spreads the flowers' genes far and wide. In The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan ingeniously demonstrates how people and domesticated plants have formed a similarly reciprocal relationship. He masterfully links four fundamental human desires -- sweetness, beauty, intoxication and control -- with the plants that satisfy them: the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. In telling the stories of four familiar species, Pollan illustrates how the plants have evolved to satisfy humankind's most basic yearnings. And just as we've benefited from these plants, the plants have also benefited at least as much from their association with us. So who is really domesticating whom?\n\n**********************************************************************\nAll as mp3 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f67c9c8ed4e23c5550b971e36751f42a6690be9b","amp;dn":"2+Michael+Pollan+Books+-+The+Omnivore%5C%27s+Dilemma+%26+The+Botany+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f67c9c8ed4e23c5550b971e36751f42a6690be9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,124,156,142,212,226,60,85,80,185,113,227,103,81,244,42,102,144,190,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
