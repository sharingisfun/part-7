De film werd winnaar van De Gouden Palm op hetFilmfestival van Cannes.\nDinsdag 20 april 1999, het lijkt een gewone dag op de Watt High School, in Portland, Oregon. Een dag met lesuren, football, huiswerk en geroddel. Nate en Carrie hebben afgesproken voor lunch. Eli neemt foto's van voorbijgangers. John laat de autosleutels van zijn vader achter voor z'n broer. Brittany, Jordan en Nicole roddelen en klagen over het gezeur van hun moeders. Tot het moment dat hun levens overhoop worden gegooid. Twee leerlingen richten een bloedbad aan door te schieten op iedereen die hun pad kruist.\n\nElephant is a 2003 drama film edited, written and directed by Gus Van Sant. It takes place in the fictional Watt High School, in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon, and chronicles the events surrounding a school shooting, based in part on the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. The film begins a short time before the shooting occurs, following the lives of several characters both in and out of school, who are unaware of what is about to unfold. The film stars mostly new or non-professional actors, including John Robinson, Alex Frost, and Eric Deulen.\nElephant is the second film in Van Sant's &quot;Death Trilogy&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ the first being Gerry (2002) and the third being Last Days (2005) Ã¢â‚¬â€ in which all three are based on actual events.\nElephant was generally acclaimed by critics and received the Palme d'Or at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, in which Patrice ChÃƒÂ©reau was the head of the jury. As the first high-profile movie to depict a high school shooting since Columbine, the film was controversial for its subject matter and possible influence on teenage copy-cats.\n\nThe film opens with Mr. McFarland (Timothy Bottoms) driving erratically down a residential street on the way to drop off his son, John (John Robinson). John notices damage to the car and realizes that his father is drunk, so John instructs him to move to the passenger seat and let him drive.\nThe camera then follows students as they walk down the hallways, talk to friends, and go to class. Many characters are shown in long tracking shots that do not turn away. Alex (Alex Frost) and Eric (Eric Deulen) are shown being bullied at school by the so-called jocks, one of whom diverts a teacher and then throws a spitball at Alex during science class. Later, Alex and Eric are shown at home ordering weapons from a website and receiving a rifle in the mail. While Alex is taking a shower, Eric gets in with him. He claims that he has never kissed anyone before, and the two kiss. The two are later shown formulating an attack plan. The next day, Alex and Eric prepare for the shooting, then make their way to school in silence in Alex's car.\nAfter arriving at school, Alex and Eric encounter John outside and tell him to leave, as some &quot;heavy shit's about to go down&quot;. Realizing what is about to happen, John attempts to warn others not to enter the school, to little effect. The two gunmen then enter the school, and after their plans to blow up parts of the school with propane bombs fail, begin shooting indiscriminately. Elias (Elias McConnell) photographs them entering the library where they open fire, shooting several students, including Michelle and presumably Elias.\nRealizing that the gunfire is real, students now begin to panic, while teachers attempt to quickly evacuate everyone. The two boys separate, continuing their killing spree. Alex enters the bathroom where Brittany, Jordan and Nicole are, presumably shooting all three. Mr. Luce, cornered by Eric in a hallway, begs Eric to lower his weapon and talk to him, but Eric yells, &quot;I ain't putting shit down!&quot; and fires at him. He does speak to Mr. Luce, however; while he is doing so, he turns around suddenly to see Benny approaching him. Eric shoots and presumably kills Benny. Eric turns back to Luce and warns him not to bully kids like Alex and himself. He then agrees to let the man go, only to gun him down seconds later.\nAlex enters the cafeteria, which is strewn with overturned chairs, backpacks, several dead bodies, and numerous abandoned half-eaten lunches, and sits down. Alex picks up a cup from an abandoned lunch and casually drinks from it. Eric meets up with him, and they have a brief conversation, which ends when Alex shoots Eric in mid-sentence. Alex then leaves the cafeteria, showing no emotion over shooting Eric, and discovers Carrie and Nathan in a freezer. He tauntingly recites &quot;Eeny, meeny, miny, moe&quot; to them to decide whom he should kill first. The film ends without resolution; the last shot is similar to the first, a cloudy blue sky.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cb3b999e321f8f7335a49e0746817da9b0cd320","amp;dn":"Elephant.2003.Dvd5.NL.FR.Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cb3b999e321f8f7335a49e0746817da9b0cd320","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,179,185,153,227,33,248,247,51,90,73,224,116,104,23,218,155,12,211,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
