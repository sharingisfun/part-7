Her dream vacation turned into a nightmare, and sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s flying back to New Jersey solo. Worse still, her seatmate never returned to the plane after the L.A. layover. Now heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dead, in a garbage can, waiting for curbside pickup. His killer could be anyone. And a ragtag collection of thugs and psychos, not to mention the FBI, are all looking for a photograph the dead man was supposed to be carrying.\n \nOnly one other person has seen the missing photoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Stephanie Plum. Now sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the target, and she doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t intend to end up in a garbage can. With the help of an FBI sketch artist Stephanie re-creates the person in the photo. Unfortunately the first sketch turns out to look like Tom Cruise, and the second sketch like Ashton Kutcher. Until Stephanie can improve her descriptive skills, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll need to watch her back.\n \nOver at the bail bonds agency things are going from bad to worse. The bonds bus serving as VinnieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s temporary HQ goes up in smoke. StephanieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wheelman, Lula, falls in love with their largest skip yet. Lifetime arch nemesis Joyce Barnhardt moves into StephanieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s apartment. And everyone wants to know what happened in Hawaii?\n \nMorelli, TrentonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hottest cop, isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t talking about Hawaii. Ranger, the man of mystery, isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t talking about Hawaii.  And all Stephanie is willing to say about her Hawaiian vacation is . . . ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s complicated.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e03972c320fb5e7e3bb3f28f5a69a887c6386d1a","amp;dn":"Explosive+Eighteen%3A+Janet+Evanovich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e03972c320fb5e7e3bb3f28f5a69a887c6386d1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,57,114,195,32,251,94,126,59,179,242,143,90,105,168,135,198,56,109,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
