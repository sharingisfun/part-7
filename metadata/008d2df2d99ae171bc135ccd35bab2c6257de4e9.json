Just install and fly.  Enjoy!  As always, if you like it, buy it.\tSupport the people that make these great birds!\n\n\n\n\nFLYING DREAMS ARE MADE OF THIS!\n\nThe classic 20 Series aircraft, nicknamed Ã‚â€œfighters in civilian clothingÃ‚â€ because of their sleek design and amazing performance, were the first true executive jets. Their capabilities earn them a place among the extreme aircraft, setting record after record while allowing shirt-sleeve comfort in their plush cabins.\n\nThe Xtreme Prototypes 20 Series add-on aircraft package contains seven variations of the legendary Models 24, 25 and 28.\n\nEach highly detailed 3D model features over 500 parts and 40 animations. The fully functional virtual cockpit contains over 800 parts and more than 200 back and front-lit 3D gauges, lights, switches and flight instruments.\n\nA custom flight model has been designed to simulate the performance of a high-powered civilian jet aircraft in FSX. The package also includes custom visual effects and sounds, multiple camera views and a detailed flight manual.\n\nWhile this add-on package allows comprehensive procedural IFR flight, anyone who masters Flight Simulator's default jets can fly the 20 Series aircraft for FSX. It's up to the user to decide which level of complexity he/she wants to achieve.\n\n\n\nGENERAL FEATURES\n\nContains seven variations of the 20 Series business jets:\n\nTwo variations of Model 24 (fictitious tail numbers XP-241 and XP-242)\nOne &quot;black&quot; variation of Model 24 (fictitious tail number N64JZ)\nTwo variations of Model 25 (fictitious tail numbers XP-251 and XP-252)\nTwo variations of Model 28 (fictitious tail numbers XP-281 and XP-282)\n\n\nFLIGHT MODEL FEATURES\n\nCustom 20 Series flight model to simulate the performance of a high-powered civilian jet aircraft in FSX:\n\nTwo General Electric CJ-610, 2,950-pound static thrust, single-spool turbojet engines\nMaximum altitude: 45,000 feet (51,000 feet for Model 28)\nMaximum speed: Mach 0.82\n\n\nCUSTOM 20 SERIES AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS\n\nThe following aircraft systems are simulated to conform as closely as possible to the operation of the real aircraft, within the present limitations and capabilities of the simulator:\n\nFlight controls\nElectrical system\nHydraulic system\nLanding gear\nFuel system\nPower plant\nFire detection and suppression system\nPneumatic and environmental control system\nAutomatic flight control system\nCaution and warning system\nRadio and navigation system\n\nAIRCRAFT MODEL FEATURES\n\nGenuine FSX 3D models, compatible with DirectXÃ‚Â® 10\nHighly detailed exterior models, with more than 500 parts and 40 animations\nHigh resolution rendering of interior shadowing and accumulated dirt\nDirectXÃ‚Â® 10 cockpit shadows\nReflective high-resolution textures with bump maps\nEmissive (night) textures\nUnique markings and liveries on each aircraft\nMovable aerodynamic control surfaces:\n\n    Movable stabilizer\n    Elevator\n    Ailerons with trim tab\n    Flaps\n    Vertical stabilizer/rudder with trim tab\n    Spoilers\n\nHighly detailed steerable front gear\nHighly detailed main landing gear with landing and taxi lights\nFully animated engine turbine and compressor disks\nMovable main cabin door\nCockpit details including cabin and cockpit, seats, pilots and female passenger\nPaint kit for version 1.01.
