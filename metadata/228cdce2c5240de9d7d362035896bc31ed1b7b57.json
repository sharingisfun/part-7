In a carefully constructed argument, Bruce Reichenbach contends that while individuals have direct control over belief, they are obligated to believe--and purposely seek--the truth. Though the nature of truth and belief is an oft-debated topic, Reichenbach moves beyond\nsurface-level persuasions to address the very core of what constitutes a human right. These epistemic obligations are critical, as the influence of belief is evident throughout society, from law and education to religion and daily decision-making. Grounding his argument in practical case studies, Reichenbach deftly demonstrates the necessity of moral accountability and belief.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 284 pages\nPublisher: Baylor University Press (November 1, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1602586233\nISBN-13: 978-1602586239\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:228cdce2c5240de9d7d362035896bc31ed1b7b57","amp;dn":"Epistemic+Obligations%3A+Truth%2C+Individualism%2C+and+the+Limits+of+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"228cdce2c5240de9d7d362035896bc31ed1b7b57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,140,220,226,197,36,13,233,215,211,98,3,88,150,188,49,237,27,123,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
