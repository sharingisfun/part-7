The album's first single was &quot;Be Good to Me&quot; and the second was &quot;He Said She Said&quot;. &quot;Not Like That&quot; and &quot;Suddenly&quot; were released in selected countries as the third and fourth singles from the album. Tisdale supported the album with the High School Musical: The Concert and Headstrong Tour Across America.\n\nAmazon.com Review  By Tammy La Gorce - If your impressions of Ashley Tisdale are fuzzy around the edges but include visions of singing schoolgirls, blond supercuteness, and shrieking, hysterical 10-year-olds, you'll want to check them at the door before checking out Headstrong. It's not that fourth graders won't like the long-limbed High School Musical star's hooky, happy, and at times hyper solo debut. It's just that you might, too. Tisdale, a little like Lindsey Lohan and not at all like Hilary Duff, doesn't waste time ditching her groovy-juvie reputation to reimagine herself as a red-hot starlet here. &quot;He Said She Said&quot; is a steamy dancefloor seduction that ought to come with a PG-15 rating (&quot;Baby I can see us moving like that/Baby I can see us touchin' like that,&quot; it goes), and &quot;Not Like That&quot; mines familiar misunderstood-celebrity territory in a way that's less whiny than worked-up. The thing is, it all sounds pretty good--from the head-bobbing urban beat in &quot;Be Good to Me&quot; to the fuzz and boingy effects on &quot;Over It,&quot; Tisdale proves her appeal is not limited to junior proms. Which is not to say she doesn't leave a little something for fans who still dot their I's with circles: One of Headstrong's strongest numbers, &quot;Unlove You,&quot; is tailor-made for belt-outs in pastel-pink bedrooms.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Intro\n[02] So Much For You\n[03] He Said, She Said\n[04] Be Good To Me\n[05] Not Like That\n[06] Unlove You\n[07] Positivity\n[08] Love Me For Me\n[09] Going Crazy\n[10] Over It\n[11] DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Touch (The Zoom Song)\n[12] WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Be Together\n[13] Headstrong\n[14] Suddenly\n \nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:44m:57s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 113mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 06 February 2007\nRecord Company\t&gt; Warner Bros Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.ashleytisdale.com\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Tisdale\n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/a/ashleytisdale.html\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00f1a4aa81e5d774417744a38fd06a93958cc41a","amp;dn":"%5B2007%5D+Headstrong+-+Ashley+Tisdale+113mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00f1a4aa81e5d774417744a38fd06a93958cc41a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,241,164,170,129,229,215,116,65,119,68,163,143,208,106,147,149,140,196,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
