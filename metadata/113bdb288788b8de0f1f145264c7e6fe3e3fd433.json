To start, it presents the essential SQL statements for retrieving and updating the data in a database. You have to master these to work effectively with database data in your applications. Then, it shows you how to design and create a database, because application developers often end up in the role of database designer and DBA. Next, it shows how to work with views, scripts, stored procedures, functions, triggers, cursors, transactions, locking, security, XML data, and BLOB data with FILESTREAM storage. These features allow you to create database applications that are thoroughly professional. Finally, this book shows how to use the CLR integration feature and SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), so you can use Visual Studio to code stored procedures, functions, triggers, aggregate functions, and user-defined types in C# or Visual Basic.\n\nWho this book is for\nI think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fair to say that most developers donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know enough about SQL and the database management system theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re using. As one customer put it, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I know just enough about SQL Server to be a little bit dangerous!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why developers often code SQL statements that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t perform as efficiently as they ought to. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t able to code some of the queries that they need for their applications. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take advantage of all the features that SQL Server has to offer.\n\nAnd thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why this book should be required reading for every application programmer who uses SQL Server. Beyond that, this is the right first book for anyone who wants to become a database administrator. Of course, if you want to become a DBA, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to continue your study of SQL ServerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advanced features after you finish this bookÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be well-prepared to go on.\n\nTable of Contents\nSection 1: An introduction to SQL\nChapter 1.
