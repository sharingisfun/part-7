For the very first time you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout. At night you get a chance to scavenge nearby locations for items that will help you stay alive.\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them to endure the hardships. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.\n===================================================================================\nSystem Requirements (Minimum): \n\nCPU:\tIntel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo 2.4, AMD Athlon(TM) X2 2.8 Ghz\nCPU Speed:\tInfo\nRAM:\t2 GB\nOS:\tWindows XP SP3 (32 bit) / Vista\nVideo Card:\tGeforce 9600 GS, Radeon HD4000, Shader Model 3.0, 512 MB\nSound Card:\tYes\n\nSystem Requirements (Recomended): \n\nCPU:\tIntel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad 2.7 Ghz, AMD Phenom(TM)II X4 3 Ghz\nCPU Speed:\tInfo\nRAM:\t4 GB\nOS:\tWindows 7\nVideo Card:\tGeForce GTX 260, Radeon HD 5770, 1024 MB, Shader Model 3.0\nSound Card:\tYes\n===================================================================================\nCrack Information: \n\nGame Name: This War of Mine\nPre-Cracked: Yes\nCustom Installer: Yes. Made by me, ThePirateBen\nMusic Used/Created By: CODEX\nViruses: No.\n===================================================================================\nNotice: I seed my torrents for 2 days then I stop seeding them. If you wish to keep the torrent working, it's up to you.\n\nNote: A few people say they can't trust me. That is not the case. I make my torrents so you can try the games before you buy them. I will never modify the game its self unless it is to crack it. If you do have a virus detected, simple post in the comments what the virus is and I will respond as soon as I can. I will never put viruses in my games.\n===================================================================================\n\nIf you like the games in which you pirate, buy the game to support the devs, and get future updates!\n\nOnce again, I only upload these torrents so users may TRY the game before purchasing. I do not support keeping these pirated games perminately. I pirate games myself, but only to evaluate them and try them before I buy them! I suggest you do the same.\n\nRemember to SEED the torrent from me to keep them alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d336c1b2962186fdb8738f75044e2b36747b89a","amp;dn":"This+War+of+Mine+%5E%5EThePirateBen%5E%5E+%5BPRE-CRACKED%5D+%5BRELOADED%5D.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d336c1b2962186fdb8738f75044e2b36747b89a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,51,108,27,41,98,24,111,219,135,56,247,80,68,226,179,103,71,184,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
