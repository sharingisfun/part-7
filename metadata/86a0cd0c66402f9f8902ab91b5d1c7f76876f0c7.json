Produced by BjÃƒÂ¶rk, Mark Bell, Guy Sigsworth, Howie B and Markus Dravs, it was released on One Little Indian Records. The music of Homogenic was a new style for BjÃƒÂ¶rk, focusing on similar sounding music combining electronic beats and string instruments with songs in tribute to her native country Iceland. Homogenic was originally to be produced in her home in London, but was later recorded in Spain.\nHomogenic marked the first of several production collaborations between Mark Bell and BjÃƒÂ¶rk, whom BjÃƒÂ¶rk would cite as a major influence on her musical career. The album peaked at number twenty-eight on the Billboard 200, and at number four on the UK Albums Chart. Five singles were released from Homogenic: &quot;JÃƒÂ³ga&quot;, &quot;Bachelorette&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Alarm Call&quot; and &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot;. Homogenic was highly acclaimed on its initial release and continues to be praised by critics, with Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stating that &quot;if not the greatest electronic album of all time, it's certainly the greatest of its decade&quot;.\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Hunter&quot;  \t \t4:15\n2.\t&quot;JÃƒÂ³ga&quot;  \tBjÃƒÂ¶rk, SjÃƒÂ³n\t5:05\n3.\t&quot;Unravel&quot;  \tBjÃƒÂ¶rk, Guy Sigsworth\t3:21\n4.\t&quot;Bachelorette&quot;  \tBjÃƒÂ¶rk, SjÃƒÂ³n\t5:12\n5.\t&quot;All Neon Like&quot;  \t \t5:53\n6.\t&quot;5 Years&quot;  \t \t4:29\n7.\t&quot;Immature&quot; (Mark Bell's Version)\t \t3:06\n8.\t&quot;Alarm Call&quot;  \t \t4:19\n9.\t&quot;Pluto&quot;  \tBjÃƒÂ¶rk, Mark Bell\t3:20\n10.\t&quot;All Is Full of Love&quot; (Howie's Version)\t \t4:32\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86a0cd0c66402f9f8902ab91b5d1c7f76876f0c7","amp;dn":"Bjork+-+Homogenic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86a0cd0c66402f9f8902ab91b5d1c7f76876f0c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,160,205,12,102,64,47,159,137,2,171,145,181,209,199,247,104,118,240,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
