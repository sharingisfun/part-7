She has won 16 Juno Awards and seven Grammy Awards. Morissette began her career in Canada, and as a teenager recorded two dance-pop albums, Alanis and Now Is the Time, under MCA Records Canada. Her worldwide debut album was the rock-influenced Jagged Little Pill, which remains the best-selling debut album by a female artist in the U.S., and the highest selling debut album worldwide, selling more than 30 million units globally.[1] Her following album, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, was released in 1998 and was a success as well. Morissette took up producing duties for her subsequent albums, which include Under Rug Swept, So-Called Chaos and Flavors of Entanglement. Morissette has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide.[2][3]\n\nIn February 2005, Morissette became a naturalized citizen of the United States while maintaining her Canadian citizenship. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJagged Little Pill 1995\n\n\nJagged Little Pill is the third studio album (and the first to be released internationally) by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. The album marked a shift in style and genre for Morissette from her previous dance pop sound. As detailed in the article about the seventh track, &quot;You Learn&quot;, the title is a metaphor for lessons of life that are hard to accept. The album was Morissette's breakthrough album, and contained six hits, &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, &quot;Ironic&quot;, &quot;You Learn&quot;, &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot;, &quot;Head over Feet&quot;, and &quot;All I Really Want&quot;.\n\nThe album spent twelve non-consecutive weeks at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart. By 2009, the album had sold 33 million units worldwide.[2]. Additionally it was ranked by the Billboard 200 as the number one selling album of the 1990s.[3]\n\nIn October 2002, Rolling Stone ranked it number 31 on its Women In Rock - The 50 Essential Albums list, and in 2003 the magazine ranked it number 327 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[4] The album also holds a title in The Definitive 200 Albums list, in which it is placed at number 26.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;All I Really Want&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n2.\t&quot;You Oughta Know&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n3.\t&quot;Perfect&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n4.\t&quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n5.\t&quot;Right Through You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n6.\t&quot;Forgiven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n7.\t&quot;You Learn&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n8.\t&quot;Head over Feet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n9.\t&quot;Mary Jane&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n10.\t&quot;Ironic&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n11.\t&quot;Not the Doctor&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n12.\t&quot;Wake Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n13.\t &quot;You Oughta Know (Hidden)\n\n\nSome CDs contain a hidden track with two extra songs. Track 13 contains another version of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; with a heavier bass guitar (a remix by Jimmy Boyelle called &quot;The Jimmy the Saint Blend&quot;), followed by a length of silence, then an a cappella recording of &quot;Your House&quot; plays 5:12 into the track. Some CDs include only &quot;Your House&quot; as a bonus track. The original issue of the cassette contained both songs, also as the 13th track. The vinyl releases contained 3 seconds of &quot;The Jimmy the Saint Blend&quot; of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; and fade out after the opening lyrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupposed Former Infatuation Junkie 1998\n\n\nSupposed Former Infatuation Junkie is the fourth album and second internationally released album by singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 3, 1998.\n\n\nAfter the massive success of Jagged Little Pill (1995), Morissette was considered one of the biggest music stars in the world, and many fans anxiously awaited a follow-up album. A dark and wandering album, the mystery of Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie began on its cover, with a shot of Alanis' laughing and the following text printed over that image that refers to The Eight Precepts of Buddhism.\n\nThe album was also an unusual project because it featured many songs with no hooks or choruses, confounding people who heard it. Songs such as &quot;Front Row&quot;, &quot;The Couch&quot;, and &quot;I Was Hoping&quot; challenged the traditional song formula.[citation needed]\nMorissette wrote &quot;Thank U&quot; and &quot;Baba&quot; after her trip to India. The protagonist of &quot;Baba&quot; goes on a spiritual pilgrimage to India where she encounters a guru who, like many spiritual teachers in India, is referred to as &quot;Baba&quot;. The word &quot;Baba&quot; means &quot;father&quot; in the Hindi language. Morissette opened most of shows during the Junkie era with the song, and it was featured as an opener during her 2002 tours. It has been seldom played since then. &quot;Baba&quot; opened Morissette's performance on the television show MTV Unplugged in 1999, but it was excluded from the CD release Alanis Unplugged. Another live version of &quot;Baba&quot; was released on the No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees CD.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Front Row&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n2.\t&quot;Baba&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n3.\t&quot;Thank U&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n4.\t&quot;Are You Still Mad&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n5.\t&quot;Sympathetic Character&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:13\n6.\t&quot;That I Would Be Good&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n7.\t&quot;The Couch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:24\n8.\t&quot;Can't Not&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n9.\t&quot;UR&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n10.\t&quot;I Was Hoping&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n11.\t&quot;One&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41\n12.\t&quot;Would Not Come&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n13.\t&quot;Unsent&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n14.\t&quot;So Pure&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51\n15.\t&quot;Joining You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24\n16.\t&quot;Heart of the House&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n17.\t&quot;Your Congratulations&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMTV Unplugged 1999\n\n\nMTV Unplugged is the fifth album and first live album by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 9, 1999 (see 1999 in music). It comprises songs performed by Morissette on the television program MTV Unplugged. Twelve tracks were included on the album, but Morissette performed several others, including &quot;Baba&quot;, &quot;Thank U&quot; (both from 1998's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie) and &quot;Your House&quot; (the hidden track on 1995's Jagged Little Pill), during her Unplugged concert. The first single, &quot;That I Would Be Good&quot;, was moderately successful, and two other tracks, &quot;King of Pain&quot; (a cover of the song by The Police) and &quot;You Learn&quot; were released as singles outside North America. As of September 2008 the album has sold 646,000 copies in the U.S.[1]\n\nIn addition to material from Morissette's first two U.S. albums, MTV Unplugged featured performances of three previously unreleased songs from her tours: &quot;No Pressure over Cappuccino&quot;, &quot;Princes Familiar&quot; and &quot;These R the Thoughts&quot;. Morissette has stated that &quot;Princes Familiar&quot; in particular is one of her favourite and most vocally challenging songs. She performed it on her 2005 Diamond Wink Tour, where she dedicated it to &quot;all of the Dads in the audience&quot;. The ballad &quot;No Pressure over Cappuccino&quot;, one of the first songs she wrote following the release of Jagged Little Pill, is presumably about the singer's twin brother, Wade.[citation needed]\n\nFeaturing cleaner vocals, slower arrangements and a few drastic reinventions (particularly in the case of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;), Alanis Unplugged foreshadowed much of Morissette's later, softer work, particularly 2005's Jagged Little Pill Acoustic and the accompanying Diamond Wink Tour.\n\nMTV Unplugged is Alanis's best-selling album in Brazil.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;You Learn&quot; (Glen Ballard, Alanis Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n2.\t&quot;Joining You&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:09\n3.\t&quot;No Pressure over Cappuccino&quot; (Nick Lashley, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“4:41\n4.\t&quot;That I Would Be Good&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n5.\t&quot;Head over Feet&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n6.\t&quot;Princes Familiar&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n7.\t&quot;I Was Hoping&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n8.\t&quot;Ironic&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n9.\t&quot;These R the Thoughts&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n10.\t&quot;King of Pain&quot; (The Police) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n11.\t&quot;You Oughta Know&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:01\n12.\t&quot;Uninvited&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Rug Swept 2002\n\n\nUnder Rug Swept is the fifth album by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. Released by Maverick Records in the United States on February 26, 2002 and in the United Kingdom a day earlier (see 2002 in music), it was the first album Morissette had written and produced on her own. It debuted at number one on charts in twelve countries, including Canada, and produced the singles &quot;Hands Clean&quot; and &quot;Precious Illusions&quot;. Sales, however, did not match those of Morissette's previous two studio albums.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;21 Things I Want in a Lover&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28\n2.\t&quot;Narcissus&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n3.\t&quot;Hands Clean&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32\n4.\t&quot;Flinch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:03\n5.\t&quot;So Unsexy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:09\n6.\t&quot;Precious Illusions&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11\n7.\t&quot;That Particular Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n8.\t&quot;A Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n9.\t&quot;You Owe Me Nothing in Return&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58\n10.\t&quot;Surrendering&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n11.\t&quot;Utopia&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo Called - Chaos 2004\n\n\nSo-Called Chaos is the sixth studio album (fourth released internationally) by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released in May 2004.\n\nIt had been two years since Morissette released her fifth studio album, Under Rug Swept. In that time she had met her fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Ryan Reynolds, so her cheery disposition made its presence felt in many of the songs she wrote for So-Called Chaos. The album found her in a more contented and relaxed state than ever, and her songs were brighter and happier than her more volatile works like &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; and &quot;Uninvited&quot;. One reporter asked if the song &quot;This Grudge&quot; was based on the same person as &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, and Morissette replied, &quot;Different person, same era.&quot;[2]\n\nThe first single, &quot;Everything&quot;, was released to U.S. radio in the spring of 2004, and was met with mixed reaction. U.S. Adult Top 40 radio stations gave the song good airplay, but mainstream and top 40 stations were colder in their reception, and consequently it became Morissette's lowest peaking single on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Everything&quot; was included on the Totally Hits 2004, Vol. 2 compilation, and in 2006 it was featured in the film Clerks II.\n\nSome reviews of So-Called Chaos were positive, with many critics calling it her most accessible and mainstream record since her landmark debut Jagged Little Pill (1995). Still, others thought she had &quot;sold out&quot; for the sake of sales and radio play; Rolling Stone magazine, for example, said the album &quot;attempts to reverse the sliding record sales following [Jagged Little Pill].&quot;[3]\n\nThe album debuted at number two on the Canadian albums chart with first week sales of 11,200,[4] and at number five on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling 115,000 copies in its first week in the U.S. and 887,000 that same week worldwide.[5] It spent a week in the U.S. top ten before falling down the chart. As of September 2008 it has sold 470,000 copies in the U.S.[6] The second single outside the U.S. was &quot;Out Is Through&quot;, which had a poor showing in the UK. The second U.S. single was &quot;Eight Easy Steps&quot;, which, despite being accompanied by an elaborate music video,[7] failed to chart on the Hot 100 or cause a significant increase in sales of the album, which had already fallen off the Billboard 200. &quot;Excuses&quot; was released as a radio single in Brazil, where it peaked outside the top forty.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Eight Easy Steps&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n2.\t&quot;Out Is Through&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n3.\t&quot;Excuses&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n4.\t&quot;Doth I Protest Too Much&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n5.\t&quot;Knees of My Bees&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n6.\t&quot;So-Called Chaos&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n7.\t&quot;Not All Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n8.\t&quot;This Grudge&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n9.\t&quot;Spineless&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n10.\t&quot;Everything&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Collection 2005\n\n\nAlanis Morissette: The Collection is the greatest hits compilation album by Alanis Morissette, released in the United States on 15 November 2005. It comprises material from 1995 to 2005, with some soundtrack selections and a cover of Seal's &quot;Crazy&quot;. A limited edition release, which included a DVD, followed on 6 December 2005.\n\nMorissette's singles that are not on the album include &quot;All I Really Want&quot;, &quot;Joining You&quot;, &quot;Unsent&quot;, &quot;So Pure&quot;, the live track &quot;King of Pain&quot; (a cover of The Police song), &quot;Precious Illusions&quot; and the European single &quot;Out Is Through&quot;. Additionally, none of her eight dance pop single releases under MCA Records's Canada imprint are present.\n\nAs of September 2008, the album has sold 304,000 copies in the United States and 1,000,000 worldwide.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Thank You&quot; (Alanis Morissette, Glen Ballard) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n2.\t&quot;Head over Feet&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n3.\t&quot;8 Easy Steps&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n4.\t&quot;Everything&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n5.\t&quot;Crazy&quot; (Seal, Guy Sigsworth) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n6.\t&quot;Ironic&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n7.\t&quot;Princes Familiar&quot; (Nick Lashley, Morissette) (MTV Unplugged) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n8.\t&quot;You Learn&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n9.\t&quot;Simple Together&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n10.\t&quot;You Oughta Know&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n11.\t&quot;That I Would Be Good&quot; (Morissette, Ballard) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n12.\t&quot;Sister Blister&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n13.\t&quot;Hands Clean&quot; (Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n14.\t&quot;Mercy&quot; (Jonathan Elias, Morissette) (from The Prayer Cycle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n15.\t&quot;Still&quot; (Morissette) (from the Dogma soundtrack) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:18\n16.\t&quot;Uninvited&quot; (Morissette) (from the City of Angels soundtrack) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n17.\t&quot;Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love)&quot; (Cole Porter) (from the De-Lovely soundtrack) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n18.\t&quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot; (Ballard, Morissette) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlavors of Entanglement 2008\n\n\nFlavors of Entanglement[1] is the seventh studio album, fifth international release and last Maverick Records release by Canadian-American singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette.
