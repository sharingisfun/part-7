It is intended to balance between the pure and applied aspects of complex analysis and to present concepts in a clear writing style that is understandable to students at the junior or senior undergraduate level. A wealth of exercises that vary in both difficulty and substance gives the text flexibility. Sufficient applications are included to illustrate how complex analysis is used in science and engineering.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c28b0fa941b6b83d4df79d5dee030caf3de1689","amp;dn":"Complex+Analysis+for+Mathematics+and+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c28b0fa941b6b83d4df79d5dee030caf3de1689","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,40,176,250,148,27,107,131,212,223,121,213,222,224,48,202,243,222,22,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
