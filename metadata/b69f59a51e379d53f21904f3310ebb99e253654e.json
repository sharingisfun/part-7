Seeing a city unfold over time through the eyes of a detective is, of course, one of the great pleasures of crime fictionâ€”think of Los Angeles in Michael Connellyâ€™s Harry Bosch series or Chicago in Sara Paretskyâ€™s V.I. Warshawski seriesâ€”but Frenchâ€™s series explores Dublin with remarkable scope and dexterity. Each successive novel has centered on a detective introduced in a previous novel. Itâ€™s a handy gimmick, sure, but itâ€™s also created a structure thatâ€™s allowed French to explore, in increasingly nuanced ways, the city she calls home.\r\n\r\nIn the first of the series, In the Woods (2007), Detective Rob Ryan investigates a homicide in a suburban Dublin estate where he was the victim of an unsolved crime 20 years prior. In the next book, The Likeness (2008), Cassie Maddox, Robâ€™s partner on that case, goes undercover to investigate the homicide of a Trinity College grad student who bears an uncanny resemblance to her. In 2010â€™s Faithful Place Cassieâ€™s boss, Frank Mackey, returns to the eponymous Dublin tenement where he grew up and unearths the murder of the girl he planned to run away with two decades ago. In 2012â€™s Broken Harbor Mick â€œScorcherâ€ Kennedy, who investigated the Faithful Place murder, catches a case involving a young family living in a half-built, nearly abandoned housing development outside the city.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Place catches up with Stephen Moran, an up-and-comer who went behind Mickâ€™s back to help Frank in Faithful Place, as he works to solve a homicide at the private school Frankâ€™s daughter attends. Because each detective has a different history in the city, each book investigates a set of locations and relationships from his or her point of view; because they all remain connected, each book provides an opportunity to see characters weâ€™ve already met through a different set of eyes. There is no objective vision in Frenchâ€™s novels. Reading them is a singular experience of discovery and rediscovery, and each book evokes the gratifying feeling of gaining unexpected insight into a person or place you thought you knew well.&quot; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Woods\r\nThe Likeness\r\nFaithful Place\r\nBroken Harbor\r\nThe Secret Place","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b69f59a51e379d53f21904f3310ebb99e253654e","amp;dn":"Tana+French+-+Dublin+Murder+Squad+Series+%5B1-5%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b69f59a51e379d53f21904f3310ebb99e253654e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,159,89,165,30,55,157,83,242,25,4,243,49,14,187,153,226,83,101,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
