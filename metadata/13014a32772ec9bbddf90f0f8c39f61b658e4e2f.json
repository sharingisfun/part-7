I t was made in a couple of weeks so donÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“t expect a game in the size and scope of GTA with goats. In fact, youÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“re better off not expecting anything at all actually. To be completely honest, it would be best if youÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“d spend your $10 on a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe a real-life goat.\n\n\n\nInstallation instructions:\n1. Execute the .exe file.\n2. Follow the instructions.\n3. Enjoy the program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13014a32772ec9bbddf90f0f8c39f61b658e4e2f","amp;dn":"Goat+Simulator+v1.0.28026+%282-click+run%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13014a32772ec9bbddf90f0f8c39f61b658e4e2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,1,74,50,119,46,201,187,221,249,15,15,140,57,246,27,101,142,78,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
