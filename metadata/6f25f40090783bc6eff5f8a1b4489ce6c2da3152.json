A woman of intellect and presence, Elizabeth was the object of extravagant adoration by her contemporaries. She firmly believed in the divine providence of her sovereignty and exercised supreme authority over the intrigue-laden Tudor court and Elizabethan England at large. Brilliant, mercurial, seductive, and maddening, an inspiration to artists and adventurers and the subject of vicious speculation over her choice not to marry, Elizabeth became the most powerful ruler of her time. Anne Somerset has immortalized her in this splendidly illuminating account. \r\n\r\nGenre: Historical non-fiction\r\n\r\nPrint Edition: 2003 Anchor Press, 672pp\r\n \nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123515.Elizabeth_I?ac=1&amp;from_search=true\r\n\r\nIf this ebook file is not compatible with your device, Calibre is a free, open source ebook management program which can convert between multiple formats","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f25f40090783bc6eff5f8a1b4489ce6c2da3152","amp;dn":"Elizabeth+I+-+A.+Somerset+%28epub%2Fmobi+ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f25f40090783bc6eff5f8a1b4489ce6c2da3152","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,37,244,0,144,120,59,198,239,245,248,161,180,72,156,230,194,218,49,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
