It leaves no single or radio favorite behind, while adding such terrific obscurities as &quot;Long Distance&quot; (originally only released as a bonus track on the State of Confusion cassette; the early '80s were a completely different world than the late '80s), the non-LP single &quot;Father Christmas&quot;, the wonderfully sentimental album track &quot;Better Things&quot; (a close, upbeat cousin to Dylan's &quot;Forever Young&quot;), and the charming &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;. In addition to these, there are live takes of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; and &quot;Lola&quot; taken from the fine One From the Road album. It winds up being a representative selection of the Kinks' time as stadium warriors. They may have released some good albums during this period -- and Misfits and Low Budget are close to great -- but listeners looking for the bare essentials from this period will not be disappointed with this first-rate collection. [Three songs -- &quot;Catch Me Now I'm Falling&quot; plus the title tracks to Misfits and Sleepwalker -- were dropped from the CD reissue of Come Dancing... in order to have it fit the running time of a late-'80s compact disc. However, a live version of &quot;Celluloid Heros&quot; was added, which did not appear on the original 2-LP release.]\n\nTracklist:\n01. You Really Got Me [live]\n02. Destroyer\n03.
