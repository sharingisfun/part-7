So he sets off for California to live on the beach, where he finds he can make a living selling drugs. Soon George&amp;#039;s drug dealing business expands into shipping drugs across the country. Needing a bigger supply of drugs, he travels to Columbia and meets Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis). Before long, George becomes the biggest trafficker of cocaine in the United States. In BLOW, director Ted Demme and scriptwriters Nick Cassevetes and David McKenna chart George&amp;#039;s strange course into a world of girls and sun, drugs and fun. It&amp;#039;s all so easy until events change George&amp;#039;s life forever.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee06dd264918982c454af5117b35f7d23706ec0e","amp;dn":"Blow+-+Johnny+Depp.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee06dd264918982c454af5117b35f7d23706ec0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,6,221,38,73,24,152,44,69,74,245,17,123,53,247,210,55,6,236,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
