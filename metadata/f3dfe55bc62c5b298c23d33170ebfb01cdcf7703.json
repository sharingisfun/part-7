They were developed from musical snuff boxes of the 18th century and called carillons ÃƒÂ  musique. Some of the more complex boxes also have a tiny drum and small bells, in addition to the metal comb. Note that the tone of a musical box is unlike that of any musical instrument (although it is best described as somewhere between the timbres of an mbira).\n\n\nContact me on Skype as &quot;elitistinen&quot; if you have more question, or else post it here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3dfe55bc62c5b298c23d33170ebfb01cdcf7703","amp;dn":"8Dio+-+Music+Box+%5BKONTAKT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3dfe55bc62c5b298c23d33170ebfb01cdcf7703","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,223,229,91,198,44,91,41,140,35,211,49,112,235,251,1,205,207,119,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
