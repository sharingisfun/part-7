You do not need to re-install and re-configure the operating system.\n\nForgotten password recovery software has a simple user interface, supports multiple hard disk drives, detects several SAM databases (if multiple OS were installed on one volume) and provides the opportunity to pick the right SAM before starting the password recovery process. It displays a list of all local users. The software user simply chooses the local user from the list to reset the password.\n\nOther Windows login security restrictions like &amp;#039;Account is disabled&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Password never expires&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Account is locked out&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;User Must Change Password at Next Logon&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Logon Hours&amp;#039; can be changed or reset.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a22d084d5ead077a0e814a3cdf115854b4fd936","amp;dn":"Active+Password+Changer+3.5+Pro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a22d084d5ead077a0e814a3cdf115854b4fd936","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,34,208,132,213,234,208,119,160,232,20,163,205,241,21,133,75,79,217,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
