The thing that makes this\n movie so great is how realistic it is. With a few minor exceptions, the\n screenplay resists the temptation to caricaturize its characters and\n instead presents them in a way that is believable and historically\n appropriate.\n \nThis movie also does a very good job of making slavery more &quot;real&quot; to a\n modern audience by placing it in a more familiar setting. It can be\n easy to dismiss some of the horrors of slavery because they occurred\n during a &quot;less civilized&quot; time. By translating these to their modern\n equivalents, that psychological distance is virtually eliminated.\n \nWith the exception of some low-quality special effects and green-screen\n work (due to the fact that this was a relatively low-budget film), I\n have no reservations about recommending this movie to everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c45edde2524bd4f51951a750229b4d81517329ab","amp;dn":"CSA-+The+Confederate+States+of+America+%282004%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c45edde2524bd4f51951a750229b4d81517329ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,94,221,226,82,75,212,245,25,81,167,80,34,155,77,129,81,115,41,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
