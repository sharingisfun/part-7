The boys have races and do crazy things with cars (anything from driving them into swimming pools to setting them on fire). Oh and there is always an earnest attempt to kill Richard Hammond every series...\n[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e91074c4f44ea6f9ffa030d3b1a1041af6258b82","amp;dn":"Top.Gear.S21E05.HDTV.x264-TLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e91074c4f44ea6f9ffa030d3b1a1041af6258b82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,16,116,196,244,78,166,249,255,160,48,211,177,161,4,26,246,37,139,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
