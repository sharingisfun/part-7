The entire series is 7.4 GB (unpacked), which I have split up into 4 zip files, so you can choose to download parts as you complete them or the whole thing at once. As always, please seed, as this is a great deal that I feel a limited amount of people will be interested in. \n\nFull description from the udemy site:\n\nOur iOS Bootcamp teaches the tools needed to develop iPhone and iPad applications for iOS7.
