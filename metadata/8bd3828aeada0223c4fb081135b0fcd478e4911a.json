Redmerski and Jessica Sorensen come the next novel in Courtney Cole's New York Times bestselling Beautifully Broken Series...\n\nSometimes before we fall . . . we fly.\n\nOne dark moment was all it took to turn twenty-four-year-old Dominic Kinkaide's world black. On the night of his high school graduation, a single incident changed him forever, and he became a hardened man-famous in the eyes of the world, but tortured inside. Now all he cares about is losing himself in the roles that he plays.\n\nAt twenty-three years old, Jacey Vincent doesn't realize how much her father's indifference has affected her. She is proof that sometimes it isn't one specific moment that wrecks a person, but an absence of moments. She tries to find acceptance in the arms of men to fill the void-a plan that has worked just fine for her, until she meets Dominic.\n\nWhen jaded Dominic and strong-willed Jacey are thrown together, the combination of his secrets and her issues turns their attraction into the perfect storm. It could change their lives for good-if it doesn't tear them both apart . . .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bd3828aeada0223c4fb081135b0fcd478e4911a","amp;dn":"Before+We+Fall+The+Beautifully+Broken+Series+Book+3.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bd3828aeada0223c4fb081135b0fcd478e4911a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,211,130,138,234,218,2,35,196,251,8,17,53,176,252,212,120,228,145,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
