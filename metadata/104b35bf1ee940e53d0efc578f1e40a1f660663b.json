The game was created using RPG Maker, but has few role-playing game elements. Players explore the dreams of the fictional character Madotsuki, a female hikikomori who lives at home in her apartment. It is through this that the player is able to view scenes that are recognized as being genuinely disturbing at times, such as being swallowed by a large red sewer-creature, meeting a disembodied head character known only as Uboa (who then transports the player to an endless, repeating stretch of map) and a full-screen rotating image of a girl with five arms.\n\n+----------------------------------+\n|Instructions / System Requirements|\n+----------------------------------+\n\nNo install or crack is required for this freeware, portable game. Extract the ZIP file and create a shortcut to the executable (EXE) to play.\n\nA save file is included in a separate folder, in which the character has already gathered all 25 effects and is about to complete the game. To use the saved game, move it to the Yume Nikki folder. There is also another folder containing various maps that you may find useful as you play.\n\n- OS: Windows XP, 2000, 98, Me, NT\n\n- No other special requirements\n\n+-------+\n|Reviews|\n+-------+\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://db.tigsource.com/games/yume-nikki&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://db.tigsource.com/games/yume-nikki&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amethystdream.org/?p=461&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amethystdream.org/?p=461&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.honestgamers.com/reviews/7913/Yume-Nikki.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.honestgamers.com/reviews/7913/Yume-Nikki.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n+-----+\n|Other|\n+-----+\n\nFor support, concerns, questions or conversations come and join us at Suprbay:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=register&amp;referrer=185328&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=register&amp;referrer=185328&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou can contact me directly here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=185328&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=185328&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;Even the smallest individual can shape the fortunes of all.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:104b35bf1ee940e53d0efc578f1e40a1f660663b","amp;dn":"Yume+Nikki+v0.10+%282005+Full+Game+%2B+Maps+%26+Completed+Save%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"104b35bf1ee940e53d0efc578f1e40a1f660663b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,75,53,191,30,233,64,229,61,14,252,87,143,30,64,161,246,96,102,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
