There is the duality between love and dead (in Italian &quot;dellamore&quot; means &quot;of love&quot; and &quot;dellamorte&quot; means &quot;of death&quot;), a duality that Dellamorte feels in a really hard way. He is the guardian of the cemetery of Buffalora, a little town in the north of Italy, in which, we don't know why, corpses rise from tombs and Dellamorte has to destroy them. Dellamorte seems not to ask to himself why this happen, he shoots and loves. But at the end he wants to leave Buffalora\n\nStarring:\nRupert Everett","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e619bfb51a9bc568c8d586ad2920c2c6ca5a309","amp;dn":"Cemetery+Man+%281994%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e619bfb51a9bc568c8d586ad2920c2c6ca5a309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,97,155,251,81,169,188,86,140,141,88,106,210,146,12,44,108,165,163,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
