Massie.\n\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning author,  Robert K. Massie has  written a richly\ntextured and gripping chronicle of the personal and national rivalries\nthat  led to  the twentieth  century's first  great arms  race. Massie\nbrings to  vivid life,  such historical  figures as  the single-minded\nAdmiral  von Tirpitz,  the  young, ambitious,  Winston Churchill,  the\nruthless, sycophantic Chancellor Bernhard  von Bulow, and many others.\nTheir story, and the story  of the era, filled with misunderstandings,\nmissed opportunities,  and events  leading to  unintended conclusions,\nunfolds like  a Greek  tragedy in  his powerful  narrative. Intimately\nhuman and dramatic, DREADNOUGHT is history at its most riveting.\n\n\nBiography\n=========\n\nRobert Massie is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Peter the Great,\nNicholas  and  Alexandra,  Dreadnought  and The  Romanovs:  The  Final\nChapter. He lives in Irvington, New York.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/209889.Dreadnought&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/209889.Dreadnought&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:180624464190e7fe1929ee7086afebf9a0c90957","amp;dn":"Robert+K.+Massie+-+Dreadnought.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"180624464190e7fe1929ee7086afebf9a0c90957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,6,36,70,65,144,231,254,25,41,238,112,134,175,235,249,160,201,9,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
