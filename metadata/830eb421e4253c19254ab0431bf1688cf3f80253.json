Over the course of 21 tracks, this does have nearly all of the hits, plus many of the bigger album tracks. What dents this a bit is the lack of a logical, chronological sequencing, along with a few absent key tracks, such as &quot;The Stairs.&quot; For most of the audience, these songs won't be consciously missed, yet it does suggest that this could have been assembled better than it was. Nevertheless, it's perfectly serviceable as a collection of highlights, presenting all the group's big hits, from &quot;Original Sin&quot; to &quot;Beautiful Girl,&quot; all on one platter, albeit not in chronological order. The band would have been better-served by a straight chronological listing -- particularly because lousy tunes like &quot;Taste It&quot; arrive so early in the album -- but apart from that, this is en enjoyable overview, containing all the biggest hits on one disc.
