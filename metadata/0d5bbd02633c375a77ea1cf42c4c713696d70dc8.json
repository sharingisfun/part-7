In each level, the player's ultimate objective is to reach a\ntarget number of points, which is typically achieved by performing tasks\nfor the city's local crime syndicate. Each level has its own unique set of\ntasks. Successful completion of a mission rewards the player with points\nand opens the opportunity to attempt harder missions for higher rewards,\nwhile failure awards few points and may permanently seal off opportunities\nfor more tasks.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 2\nGTA2 retained the top-down viewpoint of GTA, as well as the car-stealing\ntelephone-answering formula of the original. The player has the ability\nto explore cities on foot or in various vehicles. The aim is to achieve a\ncertain score. On achieving this goal the player then can proceed to the\nnext level. Doing missions awards the player more points than any other\nmethod but are not essential for completion of the game.\n\nGrand Theft Auto III\nGTA3 inherits and modifies much of the gameplay mechanics from its\npredecessors, Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto 2, combining elements\nof a third-person shooter and a driving game in a new 3D game engine.\n\n===========================================================================|\n\nRecommended Specifications:\n-&gt; OS..........: Microsoft Windows 98, 2000 or XP\n-&gt; CPU.........: 450 MHz Intel Pentium III or AMD\n-&gt; RAM.........: 128 MB\n-&gt; GRAPHICS....: 32 MB\n-&gt; HARD DRIVE..: 1.3 Gb Free Space\n\n===========================================================================|\n\nTo Install Read INFO.nfo or Install Notes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d5bbd02633c375a77ea1cf42c4c713696d70dc8","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+1%2C+2%2C+III+%5BPC-Game%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d5bbd02633c375a77ea1cf42c4c713696d70dc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,91,189,2,99,60,55,90,119,234,28,244,44,76,113,54,150,215,13,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
