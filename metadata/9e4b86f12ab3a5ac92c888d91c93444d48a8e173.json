If you are new to the ideas of Royal Rife and the use of harmless, electromagnetic frequencies for killing pathogenic microbes you may want to review my Ã¢â‚¬Å“ElectroTherapy PioneersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Rife Report on Facebook. It includes some basic introductions to the concepts as well as some important updates about practical methods for using this technology. Just Ã¢â‚¬Å“LikeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the facebook page and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be given the download link.\n\nSo what is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Genomic FrequencyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½?\n\nWhen it comes to pathogenic microbes, which is our topic here, this simply refers to a frequency that matches the resonant signature of the microbe. Every microbe vibrates at a specific frequency Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this resonant frequency that can be matched harmonically in order to Ã¢â‚¬Å“deactivateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the microbe. These particular frequencies were derived based on the DNA or genomic structure of the microbe.\n\nMy friend Craig Ledwell has been researching this topic for 17 years and with his formula has derived a huge array of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deactivation PatternsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for pathogenic microbes. The patterns involve a harmonic group of frequencies that are designed to be run simultaneously. You can think of this like instead of playing a single note on the piano, you are playing an entire chord, or group of notes. In this case each note is harmonically contributing to the deactivation of the specific pathogenic microbe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so they must be run together to get the best results!\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m so grateful to Craig for letting me share this info with you. Because he is quite busy using these frequencies and helping people he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the time to share it with the world so I will be sharing and helping explain how best to use these patterns with frequency generators. This is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Part OneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of these Ã¢â‚¬Å“Genomic Deactivation PatternsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e4b86f12ab3a5ac92c888d91c93444d48a8e173","amp;dn":"Royal+Rife+Machine+Genomic+Deactivation+Pattern+Frequencies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e4b86f12ab3a5ac92c888d91c93444d48a8e173","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,75,134,241,42,179,165,172,146,200,136,217,28,147,68,77,72,168,225,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
