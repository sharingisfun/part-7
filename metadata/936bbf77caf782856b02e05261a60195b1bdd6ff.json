The game features the most accurately created map, complex morale, innovative control mechanics and smart AI. You have the freedom to use different strategies while the battle progresses. Your decisions and military performance play a crucial role in the result. Lead your army and win the Battle of Gettysburg! \n\nGame Features:\n**************\nSmart AI Commanders\nUltimate General: Gettysburg does not use Ã¢â‚¬Å“AI gameplay cheatsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ because it does not need them. The gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficulty is accomplished only by nine distinctive AI personalities, each with their own advantages and special skills. AI Commanders are able to evaluate and gain tactical superiority in real time, reacting according to their different commanding skills, aggressively or defensively, heroically or cunningly and resemble different, competent human players.\n\nEach one of the AI generals is a formidable, non-scripted opponent who can actively try to flank you, secure strategic locations with artillery, keep reserves and reinforce areas that it attacks or defends. The AI will try to win the battle with tactics that fit to its personality. For example a defensive opponent may not attack ferociously in the first engagement and progressively advance its forces in the next battles. \n\nEasy Controls &amp; Unit Self-Awareness\nDrag simple movement arrows to command large forces easily. Units do not need your micromanagement because they are able to act on their own initiative and re-align, switch targets, withdraw and form battle lines without player input. Consequently, you are able to give generic commands to your units and can rely on them to fight efficiently without the need for Ã¢â‚¬Å“babysittingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. \n\nDetailed Map of Gettysburg\nUtilizing satellite images and historical maps, every major location, house, ridge and hill are depicted as accurately as possible within the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique art style. If you are an American Civil War enthusiast, you will be especially happy to notice the amount of precision and information that the map provides. Not only will you be able to better understand the historical layout of the map, you will also be able to make use of each location and landmark in battle, thanks to the simulation of cover, concealment, terrain and high ground in the game. \n\nAdvanced Line of Sight\nElevation and obstructions affect unit visibility realistically. Units may make use of concealment and cover to survive artillery barrages, stage ambushes and more, but beware Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the AI will attempt to do the same to you. The units enter or exit the Fog of War gradually with a fade in/out effect that helps you perceive their hiding and course seamlessly. \n\nNumerous Tactical Factors\nIn Ultimate General: Gettysburg, you will realize that army units are not Ã¢â‚¬Å“machinesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that blindly follow orders, but they need to conserve strength and courage for decisive battle actions. Every basic tactical element that is expected for a strategy game is incorporated into gameplay. Most importantly, morale is affected by many factors including flank or rear attacks, casualties, volley shocks, artillery fire and fatigue. \n\nHistorically Accurate Forces and Leaders\nUltimate General: Gettysburg includes the full order of battle for the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Unit sizes range from the small artillery batteries to vast infantry brigades with cavalry and skirmishers in between.\nAll brigades have troop numbers and differing competencies based on historical facts. Additionally, all artillery battery numbers and types are correctly simulated. Lastly, major generals and officers actively participate in the battlefield to organize and support the armies and appear in after action battle reports to help you monitor battle progress. \n\nGame Info:\n***********\nCrack: CODEX\nRePacked by: Foxy Games\nReleased: 16 October 2014\nSize: 776 Mb\nPlatform: PC / Windows\nGenre(s): Simulator, War, Historical, Indie, Strategy, RTS\n\n\nScreenshots:\n*************  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gifyu.com/image/z7q&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gifyu.com/image/z7q&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gifyu.com/image/z77&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gifyu.com/image/z77&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gifyu.com/image/z7I&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gifyu.com/image/z7I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gifyu.com/image/z7d&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gifyu.com/image/z7d&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gifyu.com/image/z7l&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gifyu.com/image/z7l&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gifyu.com/image/z7n&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gifyu.com/image/z7n&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:936bbf77caf782856b02e05261a60195b1bdd6ff","amp;dn":"Ultimate+General+-+Gettysburg+%5BCODEX%5D+R.F.G.+RePack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"936bbf77caf782856b02e05261a60195b1bdd6ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,107,191,119,202,247,130,133,107,2,224,82,97,166,1,149,177,189,214,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
