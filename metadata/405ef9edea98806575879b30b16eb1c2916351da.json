The bill was enormousÃ¢â‚¬â€and Medicare paid it. These circumstances left Goldhill angry and determined to understand how world-class technology and personnel could coexist with such carelessnessÃ¢â‚¬â€and how a business that failed so miserably could be paid in full. Catastrophic Care is the eye-opening result.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:405ef9edea98806575879b30b16eb1c2916351da","amp;dn":"Catastrophic+Care%3A+How+American+Health+Care+Killed+My+Father","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"405ef9edea98806575879b30b16eb1c2916351da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,94,249,237,234,152,128,101,117,135,155,48,177,110,177,194,145,99,81,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
