And these Groovegrass Boyz never sounded better! An exciting adventure that includes some pretty fancy fiddle work by Jason Carter. The senior McCoury, Del, is bright and meaningful on &quot;The Old Accent&quot; and solidly traditional on &quot;Speak to Me Little Darlin'.&quot; Mac Wiseman is superb vocally on &quot;When a Soldier Knocks.&quot; These three masters blend their voices effortlessly throughout, as &quot;Live and Let Live&quot; displays. The McCoury family is unstoppable as they join Carter and bass man Mike Bubba to perform an energetic rendition of &quot;I've Endured.&quot; Don Reno's notable tune &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; is a masterpiece, when McCoury, Wiseman, and Doc Watson team up to create a stunning moment. The standard &quot;I Wonder Where You Are Tonight&quot; is exceptional as their clear harmonies rise and fall magically. Emotionally satisfying, this is a special project within the scope of traditional American music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d340d9da7363d513a53cd5393541e1d449d1911","amp;dn":"Del+McCoury+%2F+Doc+Watson+%2F+Mac+Wiseman+-+Mac%2C+Doc%2C+%26amp%3B+Del+%5B19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d340d9da7363d513a53cd5393541e1d449d1911","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,52,13,157,167,54,61,81,58,83,205,83,147,84,30,29,68,157,25,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
