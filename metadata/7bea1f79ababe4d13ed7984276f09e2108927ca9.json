Buddhism teaches that to walk the path toward \ntrue enlightenment you must have a teacher. These students are \nready to be taught the path, there is only one small snag: their \nteacher.\n\nMeet Dzongsar Khyentse Norbu Rinpoche. He may be one of the \nworld?s most eminent Buddhist teachers, but it?s a job \ndescription he slyly rejects at every turn. A citizen of the\nworld and as fascinated by soccer and filmmaking, Dzongsar \nKhyentse constantly confounds all attempts at easy \ncategorization.\n\nTaking its title from the writings of 13th-century Tibetan Lama \nPatrul Rinpoche, the film?s point of view is inspired by \nBuddhist philosophy ? which says that we can?t really change\nhuman behavior until we learn to deal with our mind. The mind is \nthe starting point of all suffering and the source of closed \nhearts and entrenched views. Dzongsar Khyentse teaches by \ndefying easy definition, forcing his students to turn inward and \nconfront their own expectations and desires.\n\nWidth: 656 pixels\nHeight 368 pixels\nBit Rate: 448kbps\nAudio Sample: 16 bit\nFrame Rate: 23fps\nData Rate: 199-205 kbps\nVideo Sample Size: 24 bit\nCompression: DivX\n\n\nFiles in this torrent:\n\nlistoffiles.txt\nwords of My Perfect Teacher - Release Guide.pdf\nWords Of My Perfect Teacher - Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche CD1.avi\nWords Of My Perfect Teacher - Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche CD2.avi\nWords of my Perfect Teacher - Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche CD3.avi\n\n               5 File(s)  1,462,322,817 bytes\n\n\n\nAccumulate Merit - Keep Sharing!\n\nI am here.\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/member.php?u=39663&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/member.php?u=39663&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor more Dharma check out:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/karmapa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/karmapa&lt;/a&gt;\n \nKarmapa Chenno!\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bea1f79ababe4d13ed7984276f09e2108927ca9","amp;dn":"Buddhist+Dharma+-+Words+of+my+Perfect+Teacher+-+Dzongsar+Khyents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bea1f79ababe4d13ed7984276f09e2108927ca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,234,31,121,171,171,228,209,62,215,152,66,118,240,158,33,8,146,124,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
