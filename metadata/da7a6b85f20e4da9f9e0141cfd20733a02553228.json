These trains were a vital cog in the military machine from carrying troops, to moving hospitals, to being transformed into actual weapons. In this compelling series we tell the stories of these incredible trains...\r\nWe combine expert interviews, authentic reconstruction, engineering graphics and archive, highlighting the extraordinary human stories alongside the engineering detail and military perspective. The stories are dramatic, exciting and filled with fascinating historical detail. Each of these incredible stories is set against a backdrop of conflict and we put the events into context. In addition to the stories of the trains we learn more about the military, political and domestic battles happening at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n4)  The First Railroad War \r\nDuring the American Civil War the nature of conflict changed fundamentally. Both Union and Confederate Generals used trains to bring thousands of reinforcements, leading to longer and more frequent battles. It was the North who exploited the railroads the better - through geniuses such as Herman Haupt, who developed techniques of swift railroad construction - and destruction. The episode tells the story of the Great Locomotive Chase - an attempt by Northern spies to steal the locomotive The General. The conflict that divided America helped its unification - the lessons learnt in the war were used to build the Transcontinental Railroad that opened four years after the fighting ceased.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/99/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3c/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/28/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/82/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/38/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8b/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 1666 Kbps\r\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 8\r\n * Part Size: 518 MB\r\n * Source: PDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.historychannel.com.au/tv-shows/1918/combat-trains-the-death-railway","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da7a6b85f20e4da9f9e0141cfd20733a02553228","amp;dn":"Combat+Trains+4of8+The+First+Railroad+War+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da7a6b85f20e4da9f9e0141cfd20733a02553228","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,122,107,133,242,14,77,169,249,224,20,28,253,32,115,58,2,85,50,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
