It outlines major categories of geometric puzzles and provides examples, sometimes going into the history and philosophy of those examples. \n\nThe author presents challenges and thoughtful questions, as well as practical design and woodworking tips to encourage the reader to build his own puzzles and experiment with his own designs. Aesthetics, phychology, and mathematical considerations all factor into the definition of the quality of a puzzle.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fd54eab867b738cf178b4a627a6b43f898c0df6","amp;dn":"Geometric+Puzzle+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fd54eab867b738cf178b4a627a6b43f898c0df6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,213,78,171,134,123,115,140,241,120,180,166,39,166,180,63,137,140,13,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
