Adolfo (Monica Cervera) is a die-hard romantic who currently shares a cramped apartment with Tomas (Miguel O'Dogherty). Though he was born a man, Adolfo prefers to go by the name Marieta, and is currently stashing away the money needed to shed the male appendage that is holding him back from full womanhood. Sex change operations don't come cheap though, and in order to raise said money Marieta must first land a decent paying job. Though one successful interview does find Marieta hired as a railroad station cleaner, the exhausted worker immediately falls asleep on the job and is quickly fired for doing so. It is in his sleep that Marieta truly comes alive though, and after falling asleep during a conversation at a nearby market, the dreamland Ginger Rogers is pulled to safety by handsome stock-boy El Reponedor (Pablo Puyol). As an intensely sexual relationship begins to develop between Marieta and El Reponedor, the aspiring transsexual discovers that even if he himself doesn't appreciate his one defining male characteristic, there are others out there who most certainly do.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : 20 Centimeters.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 49mn\n      Bit rate : 1784 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 8.19 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : Espanol\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 49mn\n      Bit rate : 1588 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 272 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 2.35\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.303\n      StreamSize : 1.21 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 49mn\n      Bit rate : 191 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 150 MiB\n\nSpanish audio, English subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by pagan50","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33e059a6052ca4cbbb666ccb27241f48c0b0a229","amp;dn":"Ramon+Salazar+-+20+centimeters+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33e059a6052ca4cbbb666ccb27241f48c0b0a229","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,224,89,166,5,44,164,203,187,102,108,203,39,36,31,72,192,176,162,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
