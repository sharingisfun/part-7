And from night one, as compiled and heard on his Live at Fillmore West album, these sets were smoking, in the pocket, and greasy, with highlights like &quot;Whole Lotta Love,&quot; &quot;Them Changes,&quot; &quot;Whiter Shade of Pale,&quot; and a burning cover of &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours).&quot; When Franklin does walk onto the stage, she struts and goes into high gear with &quot;Respect.&quot; Her performance on that opening night includes amazing renditions of &quot;Spirit in the Dark&quot; (with Ray Charles guesting), &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water,&quot; &quot;Love the One You're With&quot; (also with Charles), and &quot;Dr. Feelgood.&quot; The original album is augmented with tunes that didn't make the cut, including the oft-bootlegged &quot;Call Me.&quot; In listening to these shows, what is striking is realizing that the majority of the Live at Fillmore West LP was taken from the last night of performances. The previous two evenings here then are startling in contrast, often in intensity and sometimes in sheer grit. The opening night's read of &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; is superior to either of the others, though sonically it's a bit thinner. Another gem is the version of Bobby Bland's &quot;Share Your Love With Me.&quot; That was left off the original album. In all there are 42 unreleased performances In addition to wonderful between-song banter and inside jokes, the true flow of the shows, the enthusiasm of the audiences, and raw, in-your-face performances put this set in a league of its own. There are also a few decent photographs and an authoritative yet friendly liner essay by British critic David Nathan. This is a limited edition and most likely won't be on the Rhino Handmade shelves long. Aural history can be dry at times and of interest to those who have a penchant for such things. Aretha Franklin and King Curtis' Don't Fight the Feeling is as saucy as it gets. -  Thom Jurek, allmusic.com\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9882d4477fd21c0072699a78fd13a5c9c9dcfc20","amp;dn":"Aretha+Franklin+%26amp%3B+King+Curtis+-+Don%27t+Fight+The+Feeling+-+4C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9882d4477fd21c0072699a78fd13a5c9c9dcfc20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,130,212,71,127,210,28,0,114,105,154,120,253,19,165,201,201,220,252,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
