Luckily, my penchant for not really knowing what I'm buying was a bonus as I learned about a culture of which I was previously oblivious. This Time-Life volume takes the reader back several millennia to the tribes of northern humans who inhabited what is now considered the Scandinavian territories.\n\nUnlike their southernmost counterparts, the Northmen evolved into the Bronze and Iron ages a bit later due to the onset of colder weather. When they did pick up on technological advances, they took art and weaponry to new levels. For centuries, the abundance of amber in their lands made the Northmen a tidy profit providing for an easier lifestyle. But when the Dorian migrations disrupted the ancient Mediterranean cultures, the amber trade fell apart and the dark ages hit the north especially hard.\n\nI found this all very interesting, especially the connections to the civilizations we already know (Mycenae, Athens, Rome). The fantastic metallurgy, the Bog Men sacrifices, the strange ships all make for fascinating reading","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d1f1a0a72778d6e493d538fbb2ff7e4e76630f8","amp;dn":"The+Northman+%28Time-Life+Emergence+of+Man%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d1f1a0a72778d6e493d538fbb2ff7e4e76630f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,31,26,10,114,119,141,110,73,61,83,143,187,47,247,228,231,102,48,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
