Intellectual and cultural turmoil had then reached a peak and provided fertile soil for the formation of the movement. For many artists influenced by European art, the movement represented a way of liberating themselves from the social and aesthetic constraints of the past. It was these Avant-Garde artists who, through their immense creativity, gave birth to abstract art, thereby elevating Russian culture to a modern level. Such painters as Kandinsky, Malevitch, Gontcharova, Larionov, and Tatline, to name but a few, had a definitive impact on 20th-century art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:861f65ee2a0a0117d8300c88facdabc447986512","amp;dn":"Russian+Avant-Garde+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"861f65ee2a0a0117d8300c88facdabc447986512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,31,101,238,42,10,1,23,216,48,12,136,250,205,171,196,71,152,101,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
