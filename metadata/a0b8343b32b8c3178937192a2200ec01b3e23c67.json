The following February Steve Smith, a writer for the Providence Journal in Rhode Island, wrote an article titled &quot;Could Klaatu Be the Beatles? Mystery Is a Magical Mystery Tour.&quot; The article began the rumor that Klaatu was &quot;more than likely either in part or in whole the Beatles.&quot; These conjectures, fueled by a series of articles in trade magazines like Billboard created a huge amount of hype and Capitol did nothing to deny or confirm the rumors. Throughout 1977, record sales soared and radio stations ran &quot;Is Klaatu the Beatles?&quot; promotions. Reportedly, some of the &quot;clues&quot; as to whether or not Klaatu were the Beatles included backward messages, Morse code, references to the group's identities in the song lyrics, and the word &quot;Beatles&quot; hidden in various places on the record jacket. After several months of conjecture, the group's identity was revealed at the end of year -- it wasn't the Beatles after all, it was Terry Draper (songwriter, vocalist, drummer), John Woloschuck, and Dee Long. Immediately, their record sales declined, and due to a backlash generated by the Beatles hoax their four subsequent albums failed to sell. The group broke up in 1981.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0b8343b32b8c3178937192a2200ec01b3e23c67","amp;dn":"Klaatu+CD+Collection+-+All+5+of+their+original+recordings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0b8343b32b8c3178937192a2200ec01b3e23c67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,184,52,59,50,184,195,23,137,55,25,42,34,0,236,1,179,226,60,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
