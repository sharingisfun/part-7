It explores both their art and their ideas and, by studying the way in which the Brotherhood itself came to be formed, attempts to pinpoint the particular qualities that underlay their originality; discusses too how much their aims were a crystallization and synthesis of ideas current in the mid-nineteenth century world of art. While the central paintings of Rossetti, Hunt and Millais Ã¢â‚¬â€ executed between 1848 and 1852Ã¢â‚¬â€are considered in some detail, the contributions of the less well-known members and associates of the Brotherhood are also examined. A final section traces the Brotherhood's influence through the later years of the nineteenth century and relates it to the Aesthetic Movement and Art Nouveau","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7499a403adbfe7e7d792efd40d46cbbe0aa7079f","amp;dn":"The+Pre-Raphaelites+by+John+Nicoll+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7499a403adbfe7e7d792efd40d46cbbe0aa7079f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,153,164,3,173,191,231,231,215,146,239,212,13,70,203,190,10,167,7,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
