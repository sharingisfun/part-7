The band was active from 1988 to 1990. Frontman Andrew Wood's personality and compositions helped to catapult the group to the top of the burgeoning late 1980s/early 1990s Seattle music scene. Wood died only days before the scheduled release of the band's debut album, Apple, thus ending the group's hopes of success. The album was finally released a few months later. Although Mother Love Bone is remembered by many as a very talented band in its own right, its legacy, for some, is overshadowed by Wood's death and the bands that its former members would later form, most notably Pearl Jam. \n\n\nApple 1990 (Remastered 2003)\n\n\nApple is the only full-length studio album by the American rock band Mother Love Bone. It was released on July 19, 1990 through Stardog/Mercury Records.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;This Is Shangrila&quot; \t3:42\n2.\t&quot;Stardog Champion&quot; \t4:58\n3.\t&quot;Holy Roller&quot; \t4:27\n4.\t&quot;Bone China&quot; \t3:44\n5.\t&quot;Come Bite the Apple&quot; \t5:26\n6.\t&quot;Stargazer&quot; \t4:49\n7.\t&quot;Heartshine&quot; \t4:36\n8.\t&quot;Captain Hi-Top&quot; \t3:07\n9.\t&quot;Man of Golden Words&quot; \t3:41\n10.\t&quot;Capricorn Sister&quot; \t4:19\n11.\t&quot;Gentle Groove[I]&quot; \n4:02\n12.\t&quot;Mr. Danny Boy&quot; \t4:50\n13.\t&quot;Crown of Thorns&quot; \n14.\t&quot;Lady Godiva Blues&quot;\n\n\n\nMother Love Bone (Stardog Champion) 1992\n\n\nMother Love Bone (also known as Stardog Champion) is a compilation album by the American rock band Mother Love Bone.
