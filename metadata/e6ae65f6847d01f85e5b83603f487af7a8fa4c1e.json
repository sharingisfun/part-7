Bounds, and a reclusive islander shares his world with shape-changing selkies in Robert Holdstock's haunting tale &quot;The Silvering&quot;.\n\nLate-night office workers are menaced by hungry horrors in Ramsey Cambell's claustrophobic &quot;Down There&quot;, while the monsters of both Brian Lumley's &quot;The Thin People&quot; and Basil Copper's &quot;The Flabby Men&quot; share only a semblance of humanity. The King of the Monsters himself turns up in &quot;Godzilla's Twelve Step Program&quot; by Joe R. Lansdale, R. Chetwynd-Hayes' &quot;The Shadmock&quot; and Clive Barker's &quot;Rawhead Rex&quot; are genuinely new monsters, and the last monster-fighter and the last classic monster confront each other in Kim Newman's &quot;The Chill Clutch of the Unseen&quot;.\n\nIf you like monsters, then there are plenty to choose from in this creature-filled collection boasting some of the biggest names in horror, fantasy and science fiction.\n\nContents:\n\nIntroduction: How to Make a Monster by Stephen Jones\nVisitation by David J.
