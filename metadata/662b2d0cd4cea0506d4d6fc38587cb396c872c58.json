I. Gurdjieff, first published in English in 1963. \r\nShot on location in Afghanistan (except for dance sequences, which were filmed in England), it starred Terence Stamp, and Dragan MaksimoviÄ‡ as the adult Gurdjieff. The film was entered into the 29th Berlin International Film Festival and nominated for the Golden Bear.\r\nThe plot involves Gurdjieff and his companions' search for truth in a series of dialogues and vignettes, much as in the book. Unlike the book, these result in a definite climaxâ€”Gurdjieff's initiation into the mysterious Sarmoung Brotherhood","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:662b2d0cd4cea0506d4d6fc38587cb396c872c58","amp;dn":"Gurdjieff+-+Meetings+with+Remarkable+Men+%28DivX%29+%281979%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"662b2d0cd4cea0506d4d6fc38587cb396c872c58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,43,45,12,212,206,160,80,109,77,111,195,133,135,203,57,108,135,44,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
