The series takes place in the near-future and focuses on various virtual reality MMORPG worlds. The light novels began publication on ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Bunko label from April 10, 2009, with a spin-off series launching in October 2012, and are licensed in North America by Yen Press. The series has spawned five manga adaptations. A television anime series produced by A-1 Pictures aired in Japan between July and December 2012. The anime has been licensed in North America by Aniplex of America and an English-language version began airing on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block on July 27, 2013. An Extra Edition episode aired on December 31, 2013, and a second anime series, titled Sword Art Online II, will begin airing in July 2014. A video game based on the series was released on PlayStation Portable in March 2013, with a second game for PlayStation Vita to be released in April 2014. The novels and two of the manga adaptations have been licensed for release by Yen Press.\n\nSetting[edit]\nThe light novel series spans several virtual-reality worlds, not exclusively the eponymous world of Sword Art Online.\n\nSword Art Online (Ã£â€šÂ½Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’â€°Ã£â€šÂ¢Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’Ë†Ã£Æ’Â»Ã£â€šÂªÃ£Æ’Â³Ã£Æ’Â©Ã£â€šÂ¤Ã£Æ’Â³ SÃ…ï¿½do Ã„â‚¬to Onrain?)\nThe first virtual game world, as well as the setting of the first arc of the story, known as SAO for short. The world takes the form of a giant floating castle called Aincrad, with 100 floors in it. Each floor has a medieval-themed setting and a dungeon with a boss, which has to be defeated before players can advance to the next higher floor. Like most RPGs, it implements a level-based system. However, the game is altered in a manner in which players are unable to log out, and if players die in-game, their real life body dies too.\nALfheim Online (Ã£â€šÂ¢Ã£Æ’Â«Ã£Æ’Â´Ã£Æ’ËœÃ£â€šÂ¤Ã£Æ’Â Ã£Æ’Â»Ã£â€šÂªÃ£Æ’Â³Ã£Æ’Â©Ã£â€šÂ¤Ã£Æ’Â³ Aruvuheimu Onrain?)\nThe setting for the second arc of the story, known as ALO for short. All players in the game have wings and are capable of flight. It is a large world, divided into separate 'homelands' for each of its fairy races. In Alfheim's center is a very large tree called the World Tree, and the goal of the game is to reach the top. It implements a skill-based system with players increasing their stats by developing both their combat and non-combat skills. Aincrad, the castle of the first game, is later accessible to ALO players as well.\nGun Gale Online (Ã£â€šÂ¬Ã£Æ’Â³Ã£â€šÂ²Ã£â€šÂ¤Ã£Æ’Â«Ã£Æ’Â»Ã£â€šÂªÃ£Æ’Â³Ã£Æ’Â©Ã£â€šÂ¤Ã£Æ’Â³ Gan Geiru Onrain?)\nThe setting for the third arc of the story, known as GGO for short. It is a virtual game world with a main focus on guns, although melee weapons like lightsabers and knives also exist. From all the games it is the most competitive one as the money earned there can be exchanged for currency used in the real world, drawing high-tier professional players to make a living from it.\nUnderWorld (Ã£â€šÂ¢Ã£Æ’Â³Ã£Æ’â‚¬Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’Â¯Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’Â«Ã£Æ’â€° AndÃ„ï¿½wÃ„ï¿½rudo?)\nThe setting for the fourth arc of the story, the first Virtual World setting introduced to not be a game world. According to Kirito, it is graphically the most realistic of all Virtual Worlds to date. The flow of time in UnderWorld is variable and can be much faster relative to the real world's. Kikouka claimed that the current rate of its flow is 1000 times the speed of the real-world, and that the maximum rate was 1500 times the real-world's rate.\nPlot[edit]\nSee also: List of Sword Art Online characters\nSword Art Online (SAO) is a Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG), released in 2022. With the Nerve Gear, a virtual reality helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds.\n\nOn November 6, 2022, the players log in for the first time, and later discover that they are unable to log out. They are then informed by Akihiko Kayaba, SAO's creator, that if they wish to be free, they must reach the 100th floor of the game's tower and defeat the final boss. However, if their avatars die in-game, their bodies will also die in the real world. One of these players is Kazuto &quot;Kirito&quot; Kirigaya, who was chosen as one of the 1,000 beta testers in the closed beta. Since he had previous experience and knowledge of the game, he felt that he could beat the game easily. As a result, he set out on an adventure to beat the game. As the game progresses for two years, Kirito eventually befriends a female player named Asuna with whom he ultimately falls in love. After the duo discover the identity of Kayaba's avatar in SAO, they confront and destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game.\n\nUpon being sent back to the real world, Kirito learns that Asuna and 300 other SAO players have still not awakened yet. Following a clue about Asuna's whereabouts in another VRMMORPG called Alfheim Online (ALO), Kirito also enters the ALO's mainframe. Helped by his sister Suguha Kirigaya, known as Leafa in the game, he learns that the trapped players in ALO are part of a plan conceived by Nobuyuki SugÃ…ï¿½ to perform illegal experiments on their minds to put them under his control, including Asuna, whom he intends to marry in the real world in order to take over her family's company. After Kirito foils Nobuyuki's plans, he finally reunites with Asuna back in the real world.\n\nSoon after, Kirito plays another game called Gun Gale Online (GGO) to investigate the mysterious connection between it and deaths occurring in the real world. Assisted by a female player he meets in the game called Sinon, he identifies and exposes the culprits, who include some former members of a murderous guild he had previously encountered in SAO.\n\nKirito is later recruited to assist in testing a state-of-the-art FullDive machine, Soul Translator (STL), which has an interface that is far more realistic and complex than the previous machine he had played. He tests the STL by entering a Virtual Reality world created with The Seed package, named UnderWorld (UW). In the UW mainframe, the flow of time proceeds a thousand times faster than in the real world, and Kirito's memories of what happens inside are restricted. However, he ends up falling into a trap set by one of the murderers from GGO and wakes up inside UnderWorld without any recollection of how he ended up there, unable to log out, with his real self left in a comatose state.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26b264201ace5495085d4a4c747d51877072d6cb","amp;dn":"%5BVEEREXX%5D+Sword+Art+Online+Volume+13+-ENGLISH-+Alicization+Divid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26b264201ace5495085d4a4c747d51877072d6cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,178,100,32,26,206,84,149,8,93,74,76,116,125,81,135,112,114,214,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
