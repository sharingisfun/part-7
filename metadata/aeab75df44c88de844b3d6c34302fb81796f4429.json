Benjamin Martin, a French-Indian war hero who is haunted by his past, now wants nothing more then to live peacefully on his small plantation, and wants no part of a war with the most powerful nation in the world, Great Britain. Meanwhile, his two eldest sons, Gabriel and Thomas, can't wait to enlist in the newly formed &quot;Continental Army.&quot; When South Carolina decides to join the rebellion against England, Gabriel immediately signs up to fight...without his father's permission. But when Colonel William Tavington, British dragoon, infamous for his brutal tactics, comes and burns the Martin Plantation to the ground, tragedy strikes. Benjamin quickly finds himself torn between protecting his family, and seeking revenge along with being a part of the birth of new, young, and ambitious nation.\n\nDirector: Roland Emmerich\n\nStars:      Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger and Joely Richardson\nimdb:    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187393/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187393/&lt;/a&gt;     \n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7liX3.png[/IMG]\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/Dy9IN.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/Dy9IN.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/fLiNF.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/fLiNF.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/sO5aZ.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/sO5aZ.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/dHr1P.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/dHr1P.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wF4BC.png[/IMG]\n\n         to visit my facebook page for requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FkbPX.gif[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeab75df44c88de844b3d6c34302fb81796f4429","amp;dn":"The+Patriot+%282000%29+Extended+Cut+720p+BRRIP_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeab75df44c88de844b3d6c34302fb81796f4429","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,171,117,223,68,200,141,232,68,179,214,195,67,2,251,129,121,111,68,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
