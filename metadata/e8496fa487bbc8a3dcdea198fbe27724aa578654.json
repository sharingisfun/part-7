It uses great acting and loads of exciting special effects and sci-fi aliens that totally rock. The show started originally back in 1963, when William Hartnell stepped in as a pequiliar fellow named the doctor, who lived with his neice in a police box. His niece's teachers wanted to meet him, so they broke in to the police box, only to find out that this box was a time machine, and they were suddenly whisked away on a series of strange but wonderful adventures to numerous other worlds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8496fa487bbc8a3dcdea198fbe27724aa578654","amp;dn":"Doctor.Who.2013.Christmas.Special.The.Time.of.The.Doctor.HDTV.x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8496fa487bbc8a3dcdea198fbe27724aa578654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,73,111,164,135,187,200,163,220,222,161,152,251,226,119,36,170,87,134,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
