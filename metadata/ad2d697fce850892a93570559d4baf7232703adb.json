Cloning, feel-good drugs, anti-aging programs, and total social control through politics, programming, and media: has Aldous Huxley accurately predicted our future? With a storyteller's genius, he weaves these ethical controversies in a compelling narrative that dawns in the year 632 A.F. (After Ford, the deity). When Lenina and Bernard visit a savage reservation, we experience how Utopia can destroy humanity.\n\nENJOY!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad2d697fce850892a93570559d4baf7232703adb","amp;dn":"Brave+New+World+%28Unabridged%29+by+Aldous+Huxley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad2d697fce850892a93570559d4baf7232703adb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,45,105,127,206,133,8,146,169,53,112,85,157,75,175,114,50,112,58,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
