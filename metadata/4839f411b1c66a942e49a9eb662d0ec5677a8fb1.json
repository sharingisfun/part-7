The new functionality is\navailable on PC and on Linux:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Flow Control Valves\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Black oil correlations for heavy oil\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Emulsions\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Erosion and Corrosion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Global override of flow correlations in network models\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ New TUFFP Unified 2-phase flow correlations\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ OLGA-S 2000 v5.0.2 flow correlations\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Multiflash 3.5\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Retirement of old engines\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ HoSim\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ New engine preference\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Note for PIPESIM-FPT users\nFlow Control valves\nVertical completions have been enhanced with downhole flow control valves (FCV) to provide the\ncapabilities for modeling intelligent or Smart wells. The FCV currently operates in two different modes,\neither the valve settings are input to control the flow, or a maximum flowrate is set to evaluate the valve\nsize. Specific FCV data have also been added to the Pipesim database and can be selected by the users.\nBlack Oil Correlations for Heavy Oil\nA range of additional black oil correlations are geared towards the needs of simulating heavy oils. The\ncorrelations by De Ghetto et al. and Hossain et al., which were designed for estimating the dead,\nlive and undersaturated viscosities of heavy and extra heavy oils, have been implemented. Two others\ngeneral purpose viscosity correlations by Petrosky &amp; Farshad and Elsharkawy &amp; Alikhan have also\nbeen implemented. For undersaturared oil viscosity, the Bergman &amp; Sutton correlation, which is\nbased on vast database containing 1400 different oils, can also be selected.\nIn addition, the dead oil viscosity can be specified with a user-provided table of measured viscosity\nagainst temperature.\nThe correlations of De Ghetto et al. and Petrosky &amp; Farshad have also been added for the bubblepoint\npressure, solution gas-oil ratio (GOR) and oil formation volume factor.\nEmulsions\nModeling of Oil/water emulsions has been enhanced. The black oil fluid model has an expanded range\nof correlations to model emulsion viscosity as a function of liquid watercut. The new correlations are:\nBrinkman, Vand, Leviton &amp; Leighton, Richardson, and a new implementation of the Woleflin\ncorrelations for loose, medium and tight water-in-oil emulsions. In addition, a user-supplied table of\nviscosity against watercut can be specified. The phase inversion watercut (the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcutoffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) can be\ncalculated with the Brauner &amp; Ullman correlation.\nErosion and corrosion\nPipeline erosion and corrosion can now be modeled. The new dialog may be found under Setup/Erosion\n&amp; Corrosion properties.\nTwo erosion models are available: The existing API 14 E, and the new Salama 2000. SalamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s model\ncalculates the erosion rate resulting from solids (sand) entrained in the liquid phase. Sand production is\nspecified per-well, and in a network model the sand inventory is tracked across manifolds and junctions\nso an accurate sand rate is automatically available in link branches. An ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œacceptable erosion rateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ can be\nspecified, this allows calculation of a maximum recommenced velocity (the so-called Erosional\nVelocity). Erosion rates and velocity are printed in the auxiliary output page and the profile plot file.\nMaximum rates and velocities are in the system plot file.\nA new corrosion model, de Waard, is now available. This models the corrosion caused by CO2 in the\nliquid water phase. Once enabled, the model uses the concentrations of liquid water and CO2 as\nspecified by the selected fluid model (black oil or compositional). Corrosion rate is reported in the\nEnhancements and changes for PIPESIM 2007.1 5\nAuxiliary output page and the profile plot file, and the maximum rate for the case or branch appears in\nthe system plot file.\nGlobal override of flow correlations in network models\nGlobal flow correlations can now be set for all branches in a network from the Setup menu.\nNew TUFFP unified 2-phase flow correlations\nNew unified 2-phase flow correlations are available from Tulsa (in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbjaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ source). Initial testing has\nshown that in some cases these correlations may lead to convergence problems.\nOLGA-S 2000 v 5.0.2 flow correlations\nOLGA-S 2000 v 5.0.2 two phase and three phase correlations are now available in additional to version\n4.13.\nMultiflash 3.5\nThe Infochem flash package has been upgraded from Multiflash 3.4 to Multiflash 3.5.\nRetirement of old engines\nThe pre-2006 engines pnengine.exe and psengine.exe have been retired and are not on the 2007.1 CD.\nHoSim\nAs noted above, the old pnengine program has been retired. Therefore, users of HoSim will need to go\nto Setup&gt;Choose Paths and change the net engine from pnengine.exe to pnetstub.exe.\nNew Engine Preference\nA new engine preference ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRun engine via batch fileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (via Setup&gt;Preferences&gt;Engine) has been made\navailable as one of the defaults. This option will prompt an error message when a PIPESIM model fails\nabnormally; it reads: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAbnormal termination! See the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPIPESIM EngineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ window for more informationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\nThis is particularly useful for problem diagnostic and investigation.\nNote for PIPESIM-FPT users\nFPT has not changed for this release. However, the compositional package used with both PIPESIM\nand FPT has been updated, and is no longer compatible with FPT. Users running FPT compositional\ntank models will not be able to use this version. As with PIPESIM 2006.2, FPT ECLIPSE link is not supported in PIPESIM 2007.1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4839f411b1c66a942e49a9eb662d0ec5677a8fb1","amp;dn":"PIPESIM+2007.1.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4839f411b1c66a942e49a9eb662d0ec5677a8fb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,57,244,17,177,198,106,148,46,73,169,235,102,45,14,197,103,122,143,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
