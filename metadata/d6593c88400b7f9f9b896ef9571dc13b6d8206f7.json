M. Roberts has revised his monumental previous work, History of the World, taking into account the great range of discoveries that have altered our views on everything from early civilizations to post-Cold War globalism. Large portions of text have been rewritten, addressing events as recent as the relationship between the Arab and Western worlds in the wake of the September 11 attacks. As in his previous work, this is also a book of extraordinary ambition, clarity, and style that follows the central notion that human history is the story of change, a deliberate shaping of experience and environment. Among the elements that have made the book uniquely appealing are its powerful vision and voice. Roberts's book is exceptional in its genuinely global and comprehensive nature, showing the development of different civilizations through the ages, from our origins on the African savannah to A.D. 2002. Like no other book, it succeeds in conveying the staggering diversity of the human experience across a vast range of circumstances and habitats. If there is one book anyone truly interested in history should hear, this is it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6593c88400b7f9f9b896ef9571dc13b6d8206f7","amp;dn":"History+of+the+World%2C+Updated+%28Unabridged%29+by+J.M.+Roberts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6593c88400b7f9f9b896ef9571dc13b6d8206f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,89,60,136,64,11,127,159,155,137,110,249,87,29,193,59,109,130,6,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
