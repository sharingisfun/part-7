These folks know a lot \n\nmore than I ever did.\n\nI shudder at the thought of writing subtitles for those of us who could benefit.\n\nSomeday, perhaps, I or somebody else will use something like Nuance's Naturally \n\nSpeaking (for converting dictation into a text file) to come up with a first guess \n\nat what stripped closed captions would look like. This could be done here because \n\nthe speech is mostly good and clear. I once dreamed of trying this on Upstairs, \n\nDownstairs, but the language was too overlapping, fast and full of dialects.\n\n\n\nEnjoy all 26 episodes which can be stuffed into two DVDs.\n\n\nRemember I'm racing against the demise of both Pirate Bay and isoHunt.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:336b93a3151ff005dc6aaaafdf54857afb1ba36c","amp;dn":"The+Pallisers+%281974%29+with+NO+SUBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"336b93a3151ff005dc6aaaafdf54857afb1ba36c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,107,147,163,21,31,240,5,220,106,170,175,223,84,133,122,251,27,163,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
