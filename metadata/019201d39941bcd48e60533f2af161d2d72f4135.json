Napolitano frankly discusses how the federal government has circumvented the Constitution and is systematically dismantling the rights and freedoms that are the foundation of American democracy.  He challenges Americans to recognize that they are being led down a very dangerous path and that the cost of following without challenge is the loss of the basic freedoms that facilitate our pursuit of happiness and that define us as a nation.\n\nJudge Napolitano reminds readers what America is all about, that the purpose of government is to protect freedom, and freedom is the ability to follow your own free will and not the will of government bureaucrats.  He asks the simple question, which are YOU, a sheep or a wolf?  Do you blindly follow behind where you are led, or do you challenge the government at every pass, forcing it to make decisions that will protect our freedoms?\n\nJudge Napolitano asks the questions that no one else will, challenging readers to rethink why they are blindly following a government that has only its own interests in mind.  He asks:\n\n    Why is the government using the war on terror as an excuse to sidestep the Constitution?\n    Why are Americans not challenging and questioning the government as it continues to limit more and more of our freedoms?\n    What part of &quot;Congress shall make no law...&quot; does the government not understand when it criminalizes speech?\n    Whatever happened to our inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that are proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence, guaranteed by the Constitution, yet ignored by the governments elected to protect them?\n    Why does every public office holder swear allegiance to the Constitution, yet very few follow it?\n    Don't we have rights that are guaranteed and cannot be taken from us?\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nAndrew P. Napolitano is Senior Judicial Analyst for Fox News Channel and the author of Constitutional Chaos, The Constitution in Exile, A Nation of Sheep, Dred ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Revenge, Lies the Government Told You, It Is Dangerous to Be Right When the Government Is Wrong, and Theodore and Woodrow","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:019201d39941bcd48e60533f2af161d2d72f4135","amp;dn":"A+Nation+of+Sheep+-+Andrew+Napolitano","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"019201d39941bcd48e60533f2af161d2d72f4135","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,146,1,211,153,65,188,212,142,96,83,63,42,241,97,210,215,47,65,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
