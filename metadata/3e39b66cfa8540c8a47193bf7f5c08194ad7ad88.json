Fela is direct and humorous in his attack as he barks out commands to the soldiers like: &quot;Attention! Double up! Fall In! Fall out! Fall down! Get ready!&quot; Meanwhile, his choir responds with &quot;Zombie!&quot; in between each statement. Since the groove was so absolutely contagious, it took the nation by storm: People in the street would put on a blank stare and walk with hands affront proclaiming &quot;Zombie!&quot; whenever they would see soldiers. If &quot;Zombie&quot; caught the attention of the populous it also cought the attention of the authority figures -- this would cause devastating personal and professional effects as the Nigerian government came down on him with absolute brute force not long after the release of this record. Also included are &quot;Monkey Banana,&quot; a laid-back groove that showcases drummer Tony Allen's mastery of the Afro-beat, and &quot;Everything Scatter,&quot; a standard mid-tempo romp. Both songs are forgetful in relation to &quot;Zombie,&quot; but this is still an essential disc to own for the title track alone. [Zombie was passed up on the run of domestic two-fers put out by MCA, but the track is available on The Best of Fela Kuti.]\n-- allmusic.com\n\nTracks\n01- Zombie\n02- Mister Follow Follow\n03- Observation Is No Crime\n04- Mistake\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e39b66cfa8540c8a47193bf7f5c08194ad7ad88","amp;dn":"Fela+Kuti+-+Zombie+%28remastered%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e39b66cfa8540c8a47193bf7f5c08194ad7ad88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,57,182,108,250,133,64,200,164,113,147,191,127,92,8,25,74,215,173,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
