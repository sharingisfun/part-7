The band was originally called The Electric Elves, but was shortened to The Elves and finally Elf in mid-1970. Elf disbanded in 1975, after recording three albums.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1970 the band was involved in an automobile accident which claimed the life of Nick Pantas, whom the band decided not to replace. After recovering from his injuries, Doug Thaler quit the band, and was replaced by Micky Lee Soule. (Upon leaving in 1972, Thaler moved to New York and got a job as a booking agent ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Elf was one of the bands he booked. In 1983, he became co-manager of MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e. Present day he works at Metropolitan Talent as an artist manager, working with artists such as Art Garfunkel, Bruce Hornsby &amp; Ratdog).\n\n \nCover of Elf's debut self-titled albumElf's self-titled debut album was produced by Deep Purple members Roger Glover and Ian Paice, who happened to see Elf auditioning in 1972. For the next few years, the band enjoyed mild success as an opening act for Deep Purple.\n\nDio both sang and played the bass guitar until, in 1973, bass player Craig Gruber was asked to join. The same year saw Feinstein quit the band, to be replaced by Steve Edwards. Feinstein formed a band called The Rods[1], which met with a moderate amount of success, touring with groups such as Judas Priest and Iron Maiden, as well as Metallica, before finally retiring from the music industry. He would not return to the music scene until 2004, when his band, Feinstein, released the album Third Wish on the Magic Circle Music label.\n\nIn 1974, Dio was asked by Glover to sing on his solo album The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast. Dio's rich, soulful voice gained the attention of guitarist Ritchie Blackmore who had just left Deep Purple and was looking for musicians for his first solo album, Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow. He decided to use Elf for this album, and the band Rainbow was thus formed, with Blackmore replacing Edwards. After they finished recording the album, however, Driscoll, Gruber, and Soule were replaced by Cozy Powell, Jimmy Bain and Tony Carey, who played with Dio and Blackmore during the subsequent tour; Elf was no more.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nELF is the first album by Ronnie James Dio's blues rock band called Elf. It was released in 1972.\n\nAfter this album, Steve Edwards replaced David Feinstein on guitar, and Craig Gruber replaced Ronnie James Dio on bass. However, Ronnie James Dio continued to sing lead vocals for the band.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nELF [320K MP3]\n\n1. Hoochie Koochie Lady \n2. First Avenue \n3. Never More \n4.
