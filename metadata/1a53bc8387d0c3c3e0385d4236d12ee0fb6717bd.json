The two plan a blackmail coup against a rich old man, using nude pictures of a lady on a deserted beach. But things don't always happen as planned\n\nTitle: Os Cafajestes/The Unscrupulous Ones\nDirector: Ruy Guerra\nCast: Jece ValadÃƒÂ£o, Norma Benguell, Daniel Filho, Lucy Carvalho, Hugo Carvana\n\nLanguage: Portuguese        Subtitles: English (srt)    Source: DVDRip\n\nThe first thing you'll remark when you see &quot;Os Cafajestes&quot; today (if you are lucky enough to find a copy of it) is how surprisingly modern, daring and mesmerizing it still is. The existential drama of 4 characters -- two men (low-life scum Jandir, small-time playboy VavÃƒÂ¡) and two women (used up Leda, provocative Vilma), who indulge in dangerous, deceitful games that include sex, photos, cars, beaches, drugs and blackmail -- is amazingly contemporary in its visual style, boldness and acid criticism of amorality and egotism. That, combined with the virtuoso camera-work by Tony Rabatoni, the blazing summer whiteness of Cabo Frio beaches and dunes, the surprising turns in the plot, the edgy dialog and the non-linear treatment of sound vs image make this an unforgettable film, one of the most impressive directing debuts in the history of cinema (that's not an overstatement), regrettably little known outside Brazil.\n\nMany historians cite &quot;Os Cafajestes&quot; as the zero milestone of the Brazilian New Wave/Cinema Novo; it's debatable, but not the fact that it was the first wholly successful Cinema Novo film, artistically and commercially. It introduced a complex, fresh, demanding cinematic grammar, in part derived from the French New Wave (director Ruy Guerra studied at IDHEC in the 50s), in part akin to Antonioni's aesthetics, but decidedly the work of Guerra's own conceptions and artistic freedom, unburdened by concessions to studios or the market. This independent, low-budget, small cast production made entirely on location (no interiors) signaled to young Brazilian cinÃƒÂ©astes that uncompromising film-making was viable, could click with audiences and even be lucrative (at least in the 60s). &quot;Os Cafajestes&quot; took critics and public by storm and forced Brazilian cinema into adulthood.
