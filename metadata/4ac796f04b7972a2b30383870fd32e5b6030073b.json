Blankenship\nWiley-Blackwell | May 2014 | ISBN-10: 1405189754 | PDF | 312 pages|  13.9 mb\n\nThe classic and authoritative textbook, Molecular Mechanisms of Photosynthesis,is now fully revised and updated in this much-anticipated second edition. Whilst retaining the first editionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear writing style and accessible description of this complex process, updates now include cutting-edge applications of photosynthesis, such as to bioenergy and artificial photosynthesis as well as new analytical techniques.\n\nWritten by a leading authority in photosynthesis research, this new edition is presented in full color with clear, student-friendly illustrations. An interdisciplinary approach to photosynthesis is taken, with coverage including the basic principles of energy storage, the history and early development of photosynthesis, electron transfer pathways, genetics and evolution. A comprehensive appendix, containing an introduction to the basic chemical and physical principles involved in photosynthesis, is also included.\n\nMolecular Mechanisms of Photosynthesis,second edition, is an indispensable text for all students of plant biology, bioenergy, and molecular biology, in addition to researchers in these and related fields looking for an accessible introduction to this vital and integral process to life on earth.\n-  stresses an interdisciplinary approach\n-  emphasizes recent advances in molecular structures and mechanisms\n-  includes the latest insights and research on structural information, improved techniques as well as advances in biochemical and genetic methods\n-  comprehensive appendix, which includes a detailed introduction to the physical basis of photosynthesis, including thermodynamics, kinetics, and spectroscopy\n-  associated website with downloadable figures as powerpoint slides for teaching\n\nAbout the Author\nRobert E. Blankenship is the Lucille P. Markey Distinguished Professor of arts and sciences in the Departments of Biology and chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis, USA\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction to the second edition xi\nAcknowledgements xiii\nAbout the companion website xv\nChapter 1 The basic principles of photosynthetic energy storage 1\nChapter 2 Photosynthetic organisms and organelles 11\nChapter 3 History and early development of photosynthesis 27\nChapter 4 Photosynthetic pigments: structure and spectroscopy 41\nChapter 5 Antenna complexes and energy transfer processes 59\nChapter 6 Reaction centers and electron transport pathways in anoxygenic phototrophs 89\nChapter 7 Reaction centers and electron transfer pathways in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms 111\nChapter 8 Chemiosmotic coupling and ATP synthesis 133\nChapter 9 Carbon metabolism 147\nChapter 10 Genetics, assembly, and regulation of photosynthetic systems 177\nChapter 11 The use of chlorophyll fluorescence to probe photosynthesis 193\nChapter 12 Origin and evolution of photosynthesis 199\nChapter 13 Bioenergy applications and artificial photosynthesis 237\nAppendix: Light, energy, and kinetics 249\nIndex 287","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac796f04b7972a2b30383870fd32e5b6030073b","amp;dn":"Molecular+Mechanisms+of+Photosynthesis+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac796f04b7972a2b30383870fd32e5b6030073b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,199,150,240,75,121,114,162,179,3,131,135,15,211,46,91,96,48,7,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
