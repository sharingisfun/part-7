The LP yielded one Top 40 hit,\n&quot;Gettin' Ready for Love&quot;, reaching number 27 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Other\ncharting singles released from the album include &quot;You Got It&quot; and &quot;Your Love is\nso Good for Me,&quot; the latter receiving a Grammy nomination.\n\nAdult Contemporary drove the success of this album, with both &quot;Gettin' Ready for\nLove&quot; (#8) and &quot;You Got It&quot; (#9) being Top 10 hits, while the newly formed Billboard\nDance charts ranked &quot;Your Love is so Good For Me&quot; Top 15.
