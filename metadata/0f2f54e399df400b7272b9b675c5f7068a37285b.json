For more information on Living Colour read about them on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Colour\n\nI have put the best discography I can together for this band. I have included the main albums plus there's the Japanese version of &quot;Biscuits&quot; which is an EP but has a few live tracks thrown onto the end of the album. Also I've included a couple of compilations also, one of which is quite rare and hard to get hold of called &quot;Back In Colour&quot; from 2004.\n\nI have very carefully tagged each one and I've made them into MP3s so they all match at the same bitrate of 320kbps CBR/44.1Khz. They all sound very good. You will probably find that this is the best discography going of Living Colour as it's got the new album on from 2009 and also I've added the live concert they recorded in 2007 entitled &quot;The Paris Concert&quot;. It's very good and has good sound quality.\n\nLook no further for Living Colour, this is all you need for their music. I've liked this band for a long time now, they have lots of funky elements in their music and also the musicians in this band are very talented. My favourite line up was the members of Living Colour who first joined together to record the Stain album. This is also the same line up for the live concert I've included and this is my favourite line up of all.\n\nIf you download this torrent then please seed fairly and help others to get this music also, this band is worth checking out if you haven't heard them already and their music is worth seeding for.\n\nHere's a list of all the albums I've included, hope you enjoy this release!\n\n(1988) Living Colour - Vivid\n(1990) Living Colour - Time's Up\n(1993) Living Colour - Stain\n(2003) Living Colour - CollideÃƒÂ¸scope\n(2009) Living Colour - The Chair In The Doorway\n(1995) Living Colour - Pride\n(2004) Living Colour - Back In Colour\n(1991) Living Colour - Biscuits [Japanese Edition]\n(2007) Living Colour - New Morning: The Paris Concert  CD 1\n(2007) Living Colour - New Morning: The Paris Concert  CD 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f2f54e399df400b7272b9b675c5f7068a37285b","amp;dn":"Living+Colour+-+Discography+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f2f54e399df400b7272b9b675c5f7068a37285b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,47,84,227,153,223,64,11,114,114,185,182,117,197,247,6,138,55,40,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
