This updated edition features important new information on Systems Modeling Language (SysML), more descriptive material on usage scenarios based on literature from use case development, updated homework assignments, and use of the software product CORE to generate the SysML figures. This book serves as an excellent introductory reference suitable for students and professionals alike.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nThe ideal introduction to the engineering design of systemsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½now in a new edition The Engineering Design of Systems, Second Edition compiles a wealth of information from diverse sources to provide a unique, one-stop reference to current methods for systems engineering. It takes a model-based approach to key systems engineering design activities and introduces methods and models used in the real world. Features new to this edition include:\n* The addition of Systems Modeling Language (SysML) to several of the chapters, as well as the introduction of new terminology\n* Additional material on partitioning functions and components\n* More descriptive material on usage scenarios based on literature from use case development\n* Updated homework assignments\n* The software product CORE (from Vitech Corporation) is used to generate the traditional SE figures and the software product MagicDraw UML with SysML plugins (from No Magic, Inc.) is used for the SysML figures\n\nThis book is designed to be an introductory reference and textbook for pro-fessionals and students in systems engineering. It is also useful in related courses in engineering programs that emphasize design methods and models.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01376190eec7d63210ce3a6f7972e97979647352","amp;dn":"The+Engineering+Design+of+Systems+-+Models+and+Methods%2C+2nd+Ed++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01376190eec7d63210ce3a6f7972e97979647352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,55,97,144,238,199,214,50,16,206,58,111,121,114,233,121,121,100,115,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
