Often the target is the individual's spouse. The program is edited in a documentary style, using a central voice-over narration by reporter Sharon Martin, as well as interviews with people in possession of first-hand knowledge of the case, including law-enforcement officials, lawyers, journalists, friends and family members of both the victims and the accused, and at times the criminals themselves.\n\n1.Sandy Murphy\n2.Carol Carr\n3.Erin Dukes\n4.Donna Fryman\n5.Dixie Shanahan\n6.Sheila Davallo\n7.Phyllis Nelson\n8.Nikki Redmond\n9.Piper Rountree\n10.Mary Ellen Samuels\n11.Melinda Raisch\n12.Sarah Johnson\n13.Joan Shannon\n\nDownloaded From http://www.10-84.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:038287ae4f683b9dd498efe730625573b4bdf754","amp;dn":"Snapped+-+Season+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"038287ae4f683b9dd498efe730625573b4bdf754","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,130,135,174,79,104,59,157,212,152,239,231,48,98,85,115,180,189,247,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
