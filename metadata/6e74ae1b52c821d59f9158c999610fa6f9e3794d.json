He fell out of favor by the time the Puritans took the reins of government, and declared music outside church a hideous sin. While the the greater part of his works--including his greatest hit, Flow My Tears, or Lachrymae--express profound melancholia, Dowland himself was said to be a cheerful, good-natured and amusing companion. Queen Elizabeth refused to engage him at her court, complaining about his blatant Roman Catholicism (which might have included undercover work when he went to France and Denmark), but he was a favorite of her contemporary Christian IV of Denmark, who made the lutenist/composer one of the most highly paid members of his court.\r\n\r\nDowland's lute music exists in numerous variants through multiple manuscripts. Paul O'Dette's traversal tried to take all of these into account. When someone requested this set, I discovered I possessed only three of the five discs; but they were still desired. Here's the third of the three. If I can track down at some call the fourth and fifth, they will be added to the total.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nA bio is enclosed.
