A band followed, evolving into Flying Colors: Mike Portnoy (drums, vocals), Dave LaRue (bass), Neal Morse (keyboards, vocals), Casey McPherson (lead vocals), and Steve Morse (guitar). Together, they create a unique fusion of vintage craftsmanship, contemporary music and blistering live performances.\n\nIn 2008, executive producer Bill Evans began putting the idea into action. It needed exactly the right musicians. In addition to be being extraordinary players and writers, they would need to be a natural creative fit, complementing each othersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ abilities. There would be proven chemistry from past collaborations, but the new band would be different from anything theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d done. The world didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need another supergroup.\n\nAs with the classic albums, there also would be a strong production team who, creatively, would be an extension of the band: a visionary producer, imaginative engineer and compelling visual artist. Though they were seasoned artists with impressive backgrounds and catalogs, this would be new territory for most of them. And without a budget or a label, they came together with nothing more than a shared vision to create something special and unique.\n\n\n\nBand:\n\nMike Portnoy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums (The Winery Dogs/Ex-Dream Theater)\nDave Larou Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass guitar (Steve Morse Band/Dixie Dregs)\nNeal Morse - Keyboards, Vocals (Transatlantic/Ex-SpockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Beard)\nCasey McPherson - Vocals, Keyboards, Rhytm guitar (Alpha Rev/Ex-Endochine)\nSteve Morse - Lead guitar (Deep Purple/Dixie Dregs)\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
