Nightmare House 2 is based on the Source Engine by Valve, also considered a modification (mod) made for Half Life: Episode 2.\n\nThe story resumes with the player lost and confused in a hospital known as &quot;Never Lose Hope&quot;. With no understanding of how you came to be there, there's only a vague memory of the mysterious, haunting girl from Nightmare House. Soon it will be difficult to determine between a dream and reality. How long will it take you to realize that escape is not an option?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nh2.wecreatestuff.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nh2.wecreatestuff.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThis torrent is the .rar of the Mod files, how to install:\nIMPORTANT: This modification requires a registered Steam client with Half Life 2: Episode Two installed.\nExtract the folder &quot;NH2&quot; with all its contents to your SourceMods folder e.g C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\SourceMods\\\nIf you do not know how to extract a .rar archive you can open them with programs such as WinRar or 7-Zip, these can be freely downloaded off the internet. WinZip will NOT work.\nIf \\SourceMods\\ folder does not exist under your \\Steam\\steamapps\\ folder, create it. \nYou should now have Steam\\steamapps\\SourceMods\\NH2\\ as a folder with the file &quot;GameInfo.txt&quot; inside it.\nRestart Steam and Nightmare House 2 should appear in your game list.\n\nIf the above steps are too hard for you, please get the .exe install version (http://nh2.wecreatestuff.com/#downloads) - the .exe version is also on my account if you prefer to get it from there.\n\n\nPlease enjoy this game!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37a6d8c9e08c2997a607cc47e5ccb3185ebf138b","amp;dn":"Nightmare+House+2+-+HL2%3AE2+Mod+%28.rar+version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37a6d8c9e08c2997a607cc47e5ccb3185ebf138b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,166,216,201,224,140,41,151,166,7,204,71,229,204,179,24,94,191,19,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
