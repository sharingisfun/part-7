The hosts were given little chance against the might of the All Blacks who had steam-rollered their way past England in the semi-finals. Even the most ardent Springbok supporters might have wished it in their hearts, but not possibly have believed it in their minds.\n\nWith the feelings of 44 million hearts behind them, South Africa achieved their goal in the most dramatic circumstances. Relive the whole match, including the unprecedented 20 minutes extra time. Relive the whole extraordinary experience.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:328d9a7d327905348524b2f53038a1c2d8557a6d","amp;dn":"Rugby+World+Cup+1995+-+The+Final+-+South+Africa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"328d9a7d327905348524b2f53038a1c2d8557a6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,141,154,125,50,121,5,52,133,36,178,245,48,56,161,194,216,85,122,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
