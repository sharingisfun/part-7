It starts brilliantly with &quot;The Message&quot;. This track takes a great guitar sample from a Sting song. Another superb track is &quot;Street Dreams&quot;. Here Nas tells a story of chasing dreams and becoming a fat cat in the game. The next track is &quot;I Gave You Power&quot;, the most lyrical track on the album. Here Nas raps over a brilliant Primo beat and takes on the role of a gun who is tired of all the killing in the projects. The gun is a metaphor for the people who use you and then discard you. &quot;Nas Is Coming&quot; has production from Dr. Dre and Nas raps over a West Coast orientated beat. Next comes a great posse cut, &quot;Affirmative Action&quot; with AZ, Cormega and Foxy Brown. This was meant to be Cormega&amp;#039;s last song ever with The Firm, they briefly got back together but then fell out again. JoJo Hailey features on &quot;Black Girl Lost&quot; which tells story of girls who sell their souls in order to stay in the money. Mobb Deep guest on &quot;Live Nigga Rap&quot; and they send a warning shot off to all the fakers. In my opinion &quot;If I Ruled The World&quot; is the worst track on the CD. It is not due to the fact that it is the most commercial track, I just don&amp;#039;t like the beat. The album ends well with &quot;Silent Murder&quot; which has a clever use of steel drums and a string beat. Even though many people say that Nas had fallen off with his second album, I think people were being very harsh and I think that this CD has stood the test of time.\n\n\n1. Album Intro\n2.
