On their journey they get stalked by a bird of prey, encounter perils of the night, river rapids crossings, big forest fires and the looming threat of death by starvation.\n\nFood is to be found, but is there enough for everyone? You will learn that the cubs need food not just to survive, but to enable them overcome the varying challenges they will face as they make their way through the world.\n\nAre you ready for a truly different adventure, something that might evoke feelings you've never felt in a game before? In the wild, all living creatures are put to the test. The question in the end is who will survive to live another day?\n\nRetro Family have once again composed a beautiful soundtrack to an original and graphically innovative setting in a world of nature where shelter is your only hope and survival your only goal.\n\nMinimum:\nOS: OS X version Leopard 10.5.8, Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or later.\nProcessor: 2.6 GHz single core\nMemory: 1 GB RAM\nGraphics: OpenGL 2.0 compatible video card with 256 MB shared or dedicated RAM (ATI or NVIDIA)\nHard Drive: 2 GB available space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5837605a7ca2f9750eee4a809aa15218634e1e87","amp;dn":"Shelter+1.0+%5BMac%5D+%5BIntel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5837605a7ca2f9750eee4a809aa15218634e1e87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,55,96,90,124,162,249,117,14,238,74,128,154,161,82,24,99,78,30,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
