He was the author of two novels and several collections of short stories, essays, and poems.  Nobel laureate Toni Morrison described Levi's work as a &quot;triumph of human identity and worth over the pathology of human destruction.&quot;\r\n\r\nHis best-known works include IF THIS IS A MAN (1947) (published in the USA as &quot;Survival in Auschwitz&quot;), a haunting account of the year he spent as a prisoner in Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland; and THE PERIODIC TABLE (1975), a unique collection of meditations, each named for a chemical element, on the analogies between the physical, chemical and moral spheres, which the Royal Institution of Great Britain named the best science book ever written.\r\n\r\nAll Levi's major works are represented here in their original English translations.  In addition, the 3-volume COMPLETE WORKS OF PRIMO LEVI (2015) features brand new translations of all fourteen of Levi's books -- memoirs, essays, poetry, commentary, and fiction -- some of which have never appeared before in English.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in PDF and/or ePUB format as indicated:\r\n\r\n* The Art of Fiction, No. 140: Interview (Paris Review, Spring 1995).
