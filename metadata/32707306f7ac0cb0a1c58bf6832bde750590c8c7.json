Terrific production values even though it was a mini-series on TV.  Richard Chamberlain works his usual magic on a period piece.\n\nIt is number one because it comes closest to the real ending in the novel. (Ending used to be here)  Doesn't anyone actually read the book?  Oh well, I'll stop ranting.\n\n\n9-19-08\nOk. You guys are right. I edited out the ending. What a maroon I am.  If you read the book, you know the ending, if you don't, you will have to watch this version. LOL\n\n\nWide screen, color, dvd rip, avi, english spoken with spanish subs, very good quality.  If I find this version without the subs I will post it also.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0072824/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0072824/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32707306f7ac0cb0a1c58bf6832bde750590c8c7","amp;dn":"THE+COUNT+OF+MONTE+CRISTO-1975%28El+Conde+de+Montecristo%29%28Eng-Sub-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32707306f7ac0cb0a1c58bf6832bde750590c8c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,112,115,6,247,172,12,176,161,197,139,246,131,43,222,117,5,144,200,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
