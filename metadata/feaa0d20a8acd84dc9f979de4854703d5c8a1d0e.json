These personnel helped to form the character and missions of their organizations, which were not simply created from above by Hitler, Himmler, or Heydrich. Hitler's Enforcers is based on research at 34 archives in Germany and the United States, including the personnel files of over 1,000 former members, and is the first such study to benefit from the German documents captured by the Soviets and Poles and kept secret until recently.\n\nFormat: pdf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:feaa0d20a8acd84dc9f979de4854703d5c8a1d0e","amp;dn":"Hitler%27s+Enforcers+-+The+Gestapo+And+The+SS+Security+Service+In+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"feaa0d20a8acd84dc9f979de4854703d5c8a1d0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,170,13,32,168,172,216,77,201,249,121,222,72,84,112,61,92,138,29,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
