It will probably depend how\r\nmany people use it. If I don't get that many people using it, I might final\r\nit some time in the future. Popularity really does influence my decisions\r\nfor these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Installation instructions**:\r\n-To Upgrade:\r\n1 - Run the exe patch to create the upgrade iso\r\n2 - Mount or burn the iso and navigate to the drive\r\n3 - Run setup.exe and follow the on-screen instructions\r\n\r\n-To Fresh Install:\r\n1 - Burn iso to dvd or use dvd-to-usb program\r\n2 - Reboot and change boot settings to appropriate device\r\n3 - Press key on the any key message\r\n4 - Follow directions\r\n\r\nTo Activate using KMS, download the MTK 2.6b4 using the magnet link in the\r\ntorrent directory, run MTK, and select the EZ-Activator option. If you ever\r\nexperience a problem with AutoKMS activation, because of an A/V program,\r\nswitch to tap-adapter in the settings. It's more friendly with AV programs\r\nthan the secohook method.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nCODYQX4 - MS Toolkit\r\nmurphy78 - Testing, ISO design, Integration, Diskpart/Apply script\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\nmurphy78","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d21a101239ce69fa4b886684d330d9451fd73cc","amp;dn":"Windows+8.1+5in1+x64+en-US+Oct2015+murphy78","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d21a101239ce69fa4b886684d330d9451fd73cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,33,161,1,35,156,230,159,164,184,134,104,77,51,13,148,81,253,115,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
