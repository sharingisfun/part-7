Personally, I find these VSTis a bit gimmicky. A flashy interface is all well and good, but music producers just want high quality samples they can use with any sequencer. Fortunately, the Hardtechno vs. Schranz VSTi allows hard disk rendering of individual samples. It took a long time for me to do this, but I\\&amp;#039;ve RENDERED EVERy SINGLE SAMPLE FROM THE DVD. I\\&amp;#039;ve not included the pointless construction kit mix demos, but all the constituent parts are here.\nThe DVD amounted to 1.5 Gig. My lean and mean 513MB RAR file includes 44KHz 16-bit files, all normalized and trimmed to loop correctly. Key and tempo info is included in filenames.\n\n760 Loops at 135bpm\n-------------------\nBackground, Bass Drums, Synth Bass, Claps, Crashes, Drums, Hi-hats, percussion, ride, SFX, Shakers, Snares, Synths, Vocals.\n\n240 Oneshots\n------------\nBass drums, Claps and snaps, crashes, hi-hats, percussion, rides, shakers, snares.\n\nFor producers of trance, techno, electro, and hard house, this sample pack is a godsend. Why worry about quality vs quantity when you can have both? ;)\n\nEnjoy!\n--\nArtyTorrent, 24 January 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a055d0bcebbcd60f1a16e9bd2d9a1debd11189e","amp;dn":"ArtyTorrent+Pack+22-Ueberschall+Hardtechno+vs+Schranz+WAVs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a055d0bcebbcd60f1a16e9bd2d9a1debd11189e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,5,93,11,206,187,205,96,241,161,110,155,210,217,161,222,189,17,24,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
