They pioneered a raw approach to rhythm and blues that influenced a number of key bands of the 1960s British invasion, including The Rolling Stones. David Bowie covered two of their songs on his album Pin Ups.\nThe Pretty Things were preceded by Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys, which consisted of Dick Taylor, fellow Sidcup Art College student Keith Richards, and Mick Jagger. When Brian Jones joined the band on guitar, Taylor was pushed from guitar to bass and the band changed its name to the Rollin' Stones.\nTaylor (born Richard Clifford Taylor, 28 January 1943, at Dartford Hospital, Dartford, Kent) quit the Stones several months later when he was accepted at the London Central School of Art, where he met Phil May (born Phillip Arthur Dennis Kattner, on 9 November 1944, at Dartford Hospital, Dartford, Kent) and they formed The Pretty Things. \nTaylor was once again playing guitar, with May singing and playing harmonica. They recruited Brian Pendleton (born 13 April 1944 in Wolverhampton Road, Heath Town, Wolverhampton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ died 16 May 2001 in Kingsley Road, Maidstone, Kent) on rhythm guitar; John Stax (born John Edward Lee Fullegar, 6 April 1944 in Crayford, Kent) on bass; and Pete Kitson, replaced by Viv Andrews (on drums) and then by Viv Prince (born Vivian St John Prince, 9 August 1941, in Loughborough, Leicestershire) on drums. Viv Prince made his first set of drums himself while a student at Loughborough Grammar School.\nA fellow student at the Art College May and Taylor studied at, Bryan Morrison decided to have a go at managing them. Morrison was to manage them for the rest of the 1960's, building his own Bryan Morrison Agency upon the monies he made from The Pretty Things. This agency represented Pink Floyd amongst many bands\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7245bd94cd80b287737e3244713e35ba9600748c","amp;dn":"The+Pretty+Things-album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7245bd94cd80b287737e3244713e35ba9600748c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,69,189,148,205,128,178,135,115,126,50,68,113,62,53,186,150,0,116,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
