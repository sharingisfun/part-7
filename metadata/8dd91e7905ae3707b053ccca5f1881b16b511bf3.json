In the first section we've put together a 12-week plan to get you into shape, based on the format of a typical fighters training camp. Then, once you're in shape, you can tweak your training with moves, routines and tricks from top-level athletes and coaches. There's also advice on how to tailor your diet to your new training plan, and how to improve your recovery ? which is just as vital as training hard. Whether you want to fight or you're after a fighter's body, there's something for you inside.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dd91e7905ae3707b053ccca5f1881b16b511bf3","amp;dn":"Mens+Fitness+-+Build+a+Fighters+Body.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dd91e7905ae3707b053ccca5f1881b16b511bf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,217,30,121,5,174,55,7,176,83,204,202,95,24,129,177,107,81,27,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
