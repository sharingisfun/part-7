What she finds, however, is something very different: the fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© she thought was waiting for her does not exist. Everything is a trick, and she is obliged to work as a prostitute in a brothel. At the same time, Rio de Janeiro is a city going through innumerable transformations. The new President of the Republic decided to modernize the city. As part of this plan, the young scientist Oswaldo Cruz is nominated to be chief of the department of Public Health. He initiates his sanitation campaigns, first against yellow fever, for which he creates brigades of mosquito killers. Years of dissatisfaction and a strong political opposition explodes, the event that became known as the &quot;Vaccine Revolt&quot;, with the population taking control of the streets and constructing barricades in the city. &quot;Sonhos Tropicais&quot; accompanies the lives of these two personalities, their dreams and deceptions, in this moment of great changes in the history of the country.\n\nOf the countless revolts in Brazilian history, the Vaccine Revolt is the most bizarre. In 1904, an epidemic of smallpox was threatening Rio de Janeiro. Oswaldo Cruz (now a national hero) is the brilliant but naive scientist who develops a vaccine and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with only the public welfare in mind ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ persuades the government to make the shots mandatory. The people were unwilling, and in what became the largest public rebellion in Rio's history they took control of the streets for four days. Sonhos Tropicais (Tropical Dreams) enlightens us to how an act of good intentions could be the catalyst for such a tragedy. The character of Esther provides a view into the common population who already have plenty of reasons to be mad at the police and the government, and whose anger is focused against the vaccine mandate by men with hidden motives. A great movie. \n\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Sonhos Tropicais.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.50 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 4mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 730 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 2h 4mn\n      Bit rate : 1 528 Kbps\n      Width : 624 pixels\n      Height : 336 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.857\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.304\n      Stream size : 1.32 GiB (88%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 2h 4mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 170 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297402/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297402/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPortuguese (with some Yidish) audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subpack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02bbc925bf0bcfb06595c165e5da32ba8f282a22","amp;dn":"Andre+Sturm+-+Sonhos+Tropicais+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02bbc925bf0bcfb06595c165e5da32ba8f282a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,187,201,37,191,11,207,176,101,149,193,101,229,218,50,186,143,40,42,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
