Big Baby is a particularly impressionable young boy named Tony Delmonte, who lives in a seemingly typical American suburb until he sneaks out of his room one night and becomes entangled in a horrific plot involving summer camp murders and backyard burials. Burns' clinical precision as an artist adds a sinister chill to his droll sense of humor, and his affection for 20th-century pulp fiction permeates throughout, creating a brilliant narrative that perfectly captures the unease and fear of adolescence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:257decd59d2e620ce4c90524954ca0ae1f3c954c","amp;dn":"Charles+Burns+-+Big+Baby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"257decd59d2e620ce4c90524954ca0ae1f3c954c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,125,236,213,157,46,98,12,228,201,5,36,149,76,160,174,31,60,149,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
