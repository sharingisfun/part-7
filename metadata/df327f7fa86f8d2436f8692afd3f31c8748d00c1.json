Iâ€™m a great believer in knowing what youâ€™re doing. I also believe that knowing what youâ€™re doing doesnâ€™t mean you have to compose a treatise in your head every time you write a line of code; it means you know how to make the most out of the language, and understand how to analyze problems when they arise.\r\nThe Well-Grounded Rubyist, Second Edition is a serious, extensive look at the Ruby language. But it isnâ€™t a complete language reference. There are core classes that I say little or nothing about, and I discuss only a modest number of standard library packages. Thatâ€™s by design. You donâ€™t need me to spell out for you how to use every standard-library API, and I donâ€™t. What you do need, in all likelihood, is someone to explain to you exactly what class","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df327f7fa86f8d2436f8692afd3f31c8748d00c1","amp;dn":"The+Well-Grounded+Rubyist%2C+2nd+Edition+%28pdf%2Fmobi%2Fepub+%2B+source%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df327f7fa86f8d2436f8692afd3f31c8748d00c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,50,127,127,168,111,141,36,54,248,105,42,253,63,49,200,116,141,0,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
