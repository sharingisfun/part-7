For the God's sake, how did you come up with that user name dude! \n\nNow who are The Dukes Of Stratosphear?? Let me give you a clue, the members are: Andy Partridge, Colin Moulding, Dave Gregory. Wait that's XTC duh! Some background here:\n\nThe Dukes of Stratosphear was a pseudonym used by the British rock band XTC in the mid to late 1980s, concurrently with XTC's continued musical activities.The project was intended as a homage to 1960s pop and psychedelic music by groups such as The Beatles, The Byrds, The Kinks, The Beach Boys, Jefferson Airplane, Pink Floyd and The Pretty Things.\n\nThe band released two records under this pseudonym, the mini-album 25 O'Clock (1985), and the full-length album Psonic Psunspot (1987). The two releases were compiled onto a single CD under the title Chips from the Chocolate Fireball: An Anthology, which was released simultaneously with the vinyl issue of Psonic Psunspot. The Dukes were also mentioned in the credits of XTC's 1986 album Skylarking, where they were thanked for the loan of their guitars.\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\n25 O'clock \nBike Ride To The Moon \nMy Love Explodes \nWhat In The World? \nYour Gold Dress \nThe Mole From The Ministry \nVanishing Girl \nHave You Seen Jackie? \nLittle Lighthouse \nYou're A Good Man Albert Brown (Curse You Red Barrel \nCollideascope \nYou're My Drug \nShiny Cage \nBraniac's Daughter \nThe Affiliated \nPale And Precious \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:979a7b3f4fd3a9aa2a18bf112b22475042019586","amp;dn":"The+Dukes+Of+Stratosphear+-+Chips+From+the+Chocolate+Fireball","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"979a7b3f4fd3a9aa2a18bf112b22475042019586","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,154,123,63,79,211,169,170,42,24,191,17,43,34,71,80,66,1,149,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
