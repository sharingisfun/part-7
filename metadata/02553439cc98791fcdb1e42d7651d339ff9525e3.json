Being the idol of the &quot;bobby soxers&quot;, he released his first album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra in 1946. His professional career had stalled by the 1950s, but it was reborn in 1953 after he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in From Here to Eternity.\n\nHe signed with Capitol Records in 1953 and released several critically lauded albums (such as In the Wee Small Hours, Songs for Swingin' Lovers, Come Fly with Me, Only the Lonely and Nice 'n' Easy). Sinatra left Capitol to found his own record label, Reprise Records in 1961 (finding success with albums such as Ring-a-Ding-Ding!, Sinatra at the Sands and Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antonio Carlos Jobim), toured internationally, was a founding member of the Rat Pack and fraternized with celebrities and statesmen, including John F. Kennedy. Sinatra turned 50 in 1965, recorded the retrospective September of My Years, starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music, and scored hits with &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; and &quot;My Way&quot;.\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1 \n\nAll or Nothing At All\n\nIf You Are But a Dream\n\nNight and Day\n\nSweet Lorraine\n\nGuess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry\n\nNancy (With the Laughing Face)\n\nThe House I Live In\n\nBlue Skies\n\nThere's No You\n\nWhen Your Lover Has Gone\n\nStormy Weather\n\nThe Nearness of You\n\nThese Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)\n\nSaturday Night (Is the Loneliest Night in the Week)\n\nWhere or When\n\nSomeone to Watch Over Me\n\nPut Your Dreams Away (For Another Day)\n\nAll of Me\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n\nThere's No Business Like Show Business\n\nFallin' in Love with You\n\nYou Go to My Head\n\nEverybody Loves Somebody\n\nI Believe\n\nWhy Was I Born?\n\nI've Got a Crush on You\n\nBody and Soul\n\nThat Old Feeling\n\nAlmost Like Being in Love\n\nSeptember Song\n\nIt Never Entered My Mind\n\nI Only Have Eyes for You\n\nThe Song Is You\n\nDon't Cry Joe (Let Her Go, Let Her Go, Let Her Go)\n\nIt All Depends on You\n\nThe Continental\n\nI'm a Fool to Want You\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02553439cc98791fcdb1e42d7651d339ff9525e3","amp;dn":"Frank+Sinatra+-+The+Essential+2010+%282CD%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02553439cc98791fcdb1e42d7651d339ff9525e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,85,52,57,204,152,121,31,205,177,228,45,118,81,211,57,255,149,37,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
