Highlights from the album are the string-laden &quot;Out Of Sight&quot;, &quot;Mad About You&quot;, and the title track.\n\nThe same year, Hooverphonic was asked to write a song specifically for the opening ceremony of the 2000 European Football Championship, which took place in Brussels, Belgium. The result - a 12-minute long track called &quot;Visions&quot; - became the theme song of the championship, and Hooverphonic's performance at the opening ceremony was heard/seen by more than 1 billion people. On the heels of Tree's success, the band became the first Belgian outfit to headline the Belgian musical festival Rock Werchter in 2001.\n\n01 &quot;Autoharp&quot; (Alex Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n02 &quot;Mad About You&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n03 &quot;Waves&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n04 &quot;Jackie Cane&quot; (Dennis, Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n05 &quot;The Magnificent Tree&quot; (Geike Arnaert, Callier, Raymond Geerts) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n06 &quot;Vinegar &amp; Salt&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n07 &quot;Frosted Flake Wood&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n08 &quot;Every Time We Live Together We Die A Bit More&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n09 &quot;Out Of Sight&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55 (Sometimes incorrectly listed as &quot;Best Friends&quot;)\n10 &quot;Pink Fluffy Dinosaurs&quot; (Arnaert, Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n11 &quot;L'odeur Animale&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n12 &quot;Renaissance Affair&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n\nBonus tracks:\n\n13 &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (Al Stone Mix) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n14 &quot;Mad About You&quot; (FK Vocal Mix) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:48, remix by FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Kevorkian\n\nSpecial Edition Disc 2\n\n01 &quot;Visions&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:02\n02 &quot;Mad About You&quot; (Llorca's Radio Shot) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n\n--\nBrought to you by Dodecahedron.
