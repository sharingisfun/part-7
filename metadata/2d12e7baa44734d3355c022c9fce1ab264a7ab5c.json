Her father was a diplomat and she spent her childhood travelling over several continents, to Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Belgium, and France. There she was exposed to a variety of styles of music, from classical, jazz, and pop to Indian traditional composition. However, her family was also part of Mali's nobility, which has traditional caste prohibitions against their members making music. For her countryman Salif Keita, who was a member of the Manding people, it was an almost insurmountable burden. For Traore, though, the prohibitions were not as strict. The Bamana ethic group did have a musical tradition of their own, especially among women, with performers called griottes travelling to perform at weddings and gatherings.\n\nStudio Albums:\n\n1998 - MouneÃƒÂ¯ssa\n\tNumber of Tracks: 09, Total Length: 00:47:00, Total Size: 108.03 MB, Quality: 320 KBPS, 44 KHz, CBR\n2000 - Wanita\n\tNumber of Tracks: 11, Total Length: 00:58:12, Total Size: 132.66 MB, Quality: 320 KBPS, 44 KHz, VBR\n2004 - BowmboÃƒÂ¯\n\tNumber of Tracks: 10, Total Length: 01:00:12, Total Size: 138.51 MB, Quality: 320 KBPS, 44 KHz, CBR\n2008 - TchamantchÃƒÂ©\n\tNumber of Tracks: 11, Total Length: 00:55:41, Total Size: 119.58 MB, Quality: 320 KBPS, 44 KHz, VBR (except track 10 &amp; 11)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d12e7baa44734d3355c022c9fce1ab264a7ab5c","amp;dn":"Rokia+Traore+-+1998-2008+-+Studio+Albums+%5B320K%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d12e7baa44734d3355c022c9fce1ab264a7ab5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,18,231,186,164,71,52,211,53,92,2,44,159,206,26,178,100,167,171,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
