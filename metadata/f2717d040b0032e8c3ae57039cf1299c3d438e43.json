Every death is permanent and means a new randomly generated level for you to start over with a different set of weapons and items you can use, new enemies to fight and secrets to explore.\r\n\r\nHeart&amp;Slash is an indie game developed by a small but passionate team. We have a tiny budget but big hearts, and we are giving it all to make this game (our first) the best we can.\r\n\r\nFeatures (on final release):\r\n-3 worlds to explore and fight in. Each world includes its unique enemies an bosses.\r\n-Dozens of different weapons and equipment pieces (more than 100 in total) to customize Heart and your play style.\r\n-Perma-death, but a persistent progression system that gives you more options as you play the game.\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy Heart&amp;Slash as much as we enjoy making it!\r\n\r\nWelcome!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2717d040b0032e8c3ae57039cf1299c3d438e43","amp;dn":"Heart%26amp%3BSlash","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2717d040b0032e8c3ae57039cf1299c3d438e43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,113,125,4,11,0,50,232,195,174,87,3,156,241,41,156,61,67,142,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
