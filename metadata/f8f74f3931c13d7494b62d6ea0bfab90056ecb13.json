Cotton and Norcia have solo pieces, seven numbers feature two harmonicas, and the lengthy low-down blues &quot;Harp to Harp&quot; has all four of the harmonica players taking turns soloing. Much of the material is jazz-oriented, including &quot;The Hucklebuck,&quot; &quot;TD's Boogie Woogie,&quot; and &quot;Route 66,&quot; and the majority of the selections are instrumentals. Each of the harmonica players sounds inspired and the results are consistently exciting and swinging.\n\n\nTracklist:\n1. I Put My Baby Out (Norcia, Branch 2nd solo prior to vocal)\n2. The Hucklebuck (James Cotton)\n3. Blues, Why Do You Worry Me? (Musselwhite, Norcia 2nd solo)\n4. Life Will Be Better (Norcia, Musselwhite backup)\n5.
