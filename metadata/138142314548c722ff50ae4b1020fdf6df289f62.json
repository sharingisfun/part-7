Wade Wilson. Codename: Deadpool. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the CIAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deadliest agent. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also certifiably insane, suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder and haunted by the ghosts of his past. In other words, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the perfect soldier in a Cold War where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible to tell friend from foe and reality from a lie. Wilson is also the only one capable of hunting down a rogue CIA agent and recovering the stolen nuclear suitcase sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s carrying before she hands it over to AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enemies. But who is this femme fatale and why has she turned traitor? And is Deadpool crazy enough to survive or will he become trapped in a web of international intrigue?\n\nThanks goes to Hawkwind for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:138142314548c722ff50ae4b1020fdf6df289f62","amp;dn":"Deadpool+Pulp+%231-4+%282010-2011%29+%5BMarvel%5D+%28Requested%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"138142314548c722ff50ae4b1020fdf6df289f62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,129,66,49,69,72,199,34,255,80,174,75,16,32,253,246,223,40,159,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
