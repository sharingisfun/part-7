They enjoyed moderate success in North America during the 1980s.\n\nKrokus was founded in Solothurn in 1975 by bassist (and original lead vocalist) Chris von Rohr and guitarist Tommy Kiefer. Former Eazy Money vocalist Marc Storace joined the band as frontman in time for their Metal Rendez-vous album in 1980.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMetal Rendez-vous is the fourth studio album by the Swiss hard rock band Krokus and the first to feature current vocalist Marc Storace. It was released in June 1980. The track &quot;Heatstrokes&quot; charted number one in the British Heavy Metal Charts, and arguably opened up markets for Krokus in Britain and the United States, along with &quot;Bedside Radio&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Nights&quot;. Strangely, the song &quot;Tokyo Nights&quot; features a reggae beat halfway through. The album sold more than 150,000 copies in Switzerland and was certified Triple Platinum.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHardware is the fifth album by the Swiss hard rock band Krokus. It did not match the success of their previous album, Metal Rendez-vous, going only Gold in Switzerland. However, the album entered the charts in the US, UK and other European countries.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne Vice at a Time is the sixth studio album by the Swiss hard rock band Krokus, released in 1982 on Arista Records. It was the first album to feature Mark Kohler on rhythm guitar. It includes a cover of The Guess Who's song &quot;American Woman&quot;, and a song &quot;Rock 'n' Roll&quot;. The song &quot;Long Stick Goes Boom&quot; is used in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBand:\n\n\nMarc Storace: vocals\n\nFernando von Arb: lead guitar\n\nMark Kohler: rhythm guitar\n\nChris von Rohr: bass, percussion\n\nFreddy Steady: drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cb5424423866e25b6abef18f749ff2befa4969e","amp;dn":"Krokus+-+Original+Album+Classics+%5B3+CD%27s%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cb5424423866e25b6abef18f749ff2befa4969e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,181,66,68,35,134,110,37,182,171,239,24,247,73,255,43,239,164,150,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
