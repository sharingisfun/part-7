The &quot;Old Republic Era&quot; has been requested and will be uploaded.\n\nAll files are packed with Winrar, not to save space but to make it easier to select which audio books you want.\n\nYou will notice that every file has the &quot;bitrate per second&quot; noted (kbps)\nVBR stands for &quot;variable bitrate&quot;, meaning that not every file in the .rar file has the same bitrate.\nThis should make it easier to find out if you already have downloaded a particular audio book. (by comparing your own to the one in this torrent based on file size and bitrate)\n\nI also included 2 programs: &quot;File Renamer Deluxe&quot; &amp; Piston&amp;#039;s &quot;Direct WAV MP3 Splitter&quot; for obvious reasons. \n\nAll files are named properly: [Track number] - [Possible series name] - [Book title].mp3 \n\nAs you can see on this list,   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_Audio_Books&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_Audio_Books&lt;/a&gt;\nThis torrent contains all the books for this Era.\n\nI mixed the files of two copies I have of the &amp;#039;Black Fleet Crisis&amp;#039; trilogy because of quality. I suggest you download these even if you already have them because you probably have either copy.\n\nShould anyone have &amp;#039;Bounty Hunter Wars 3 - Hard Merchandise&amp;#039; on an original format, please see into ripping this. The quality of the only version is rather poor. Contact me in the comments for help or anything else about this.\n\nI suggest you bookmark my account (http://thepiratebay.se/user/Starkiller20/) to stay up to date easily. \n\nFeel free to ask questions or criticize.\nI read the comments and will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\n\nThis upload is dedicated to gomer1000.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f8a8334c2ac291ff288fa7239c510cb1492be8a","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+audio+books+-+New+Republic+Era+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f8a8334c2ac291ff288fa7239c510cb1492be8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,138,131,52,194,172,41,31,242,136,250,114,57,197,16,203,20,146,190,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
