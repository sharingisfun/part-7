The Cambrian Period was a critical time in EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history. During this immense span of time nearly every modern group of animals appeared. Although life had been around for more than 2 million millennia, Cambrian rocks preserve the record of the first appearance of complex animals with eyes, protective skeletons, antennae, and complex ecologies. Grazing, predation, and multi-tiered ecosystems with animals living in, on, or above the sea floor became common. The cascade of interaction led to an ever-increasing diversification of animal body types. By the end of the period, the ancestors of sponges, corals, jellyfish, worms, mollusks, brachiopods, arthropods, echinoderms, and vertebrates were all in place. The evidence of this Cambrian &quot;explosion&quot; is preserved in rocks all over the world, including North America, where the seemingly strange animals of the period are preserved in exquisite detail in deposits such as the Burgess Shale in British Columbia. Cambrian Ocean World tells the story of what is, for us, the most important period in our planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f76a51e5aa58285f49322c12dea0aad0792f84b","amp;dn":"Cambrian+Ocean+World+-+Ancient+Sea+Life+of+North+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f76a51e5aa58285f49322c12dea0aad0792f84b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,118,165,30,90,165,130,133,244,147,34,193,45,234,10,173,7,146,248,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
