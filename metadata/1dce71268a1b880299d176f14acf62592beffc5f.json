This is an instruction booklet meant to capture the spirit of the gaming manuals of old.P\n\nThe intent here is more artistic and for storytelling purposes, as opposed to a technical manual. As such, much information is either absent or presented in a relatively obscure manner.\n\nThe Illustrated Guide to MineCraft was made as a free download for fans and newcomers of MineCraft alike. My hope is to add some story elements to the game through this outside medium. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it.P\n\nArmand Kossayan is a graphic designer from Los Angeles who likes to take an occasional break from work related design, and do something fun. He also writes for Bits 'N Bytes in his spare time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dce71268a1b880299d176f14acf62592beffc5f","amp;dn":"Minecraft+illustrated+guide+beginners+walkthrough","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dce71268a1b880299d176f14acf62592beffc5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,206,113,38,138,27,136,2,153,209,118,241,74,207,98,89,43,239,252,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
