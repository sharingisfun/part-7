But that was before a rebellion upended his life. And once the powder smoke settled, he was left in charge of a demoralized force clinging tenuously to a small fortress at the edge of the desert.\nTo flee from her past, Winter Ihernglass masqueraded as a man and enlisted as a ranker in the Vordanai Colonials, hoping only to avoid notice. But when chance sees her promoted to command, she must win the hearts of her men and lead them into battle against impossible odds. The fates of both these soldiers and all the men they lead depend on the newly arrived Colonel Janus bet Vhalnich, who has been sent by the ailing king to restore order. His military genius seems to know no bounds, and under his command, Marcus and Winter can feel the tide turning. But their allegiance will be tested as they begin to suspect that the enigmatic JanusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ambitions extend beyond the battlefield and into the realm of the supernaturalÃ¢â‚¬â€a realm with the power to ignite a meteoric rise, reshape the known world, and change the lives of everyone in its path.\n\n#The Shadow Throne (The Shadow Campaigns #2)\nAnyone can plot a coup or fire an assassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bullet. But in a world of muskets and magic, it takes considerably more to seize the throne.\n\nThe ailing King of the Vordan lies on his deathbed. When he dies, his daughter, Raesinia Orboan, will become the first Queen Regnant in centuriesÃ¢â‚¬â€and a ripe target for the ambitious men who seek to control her. The most dangerous of these is Duke Orlanko, Minister of Information and master of the secret police. Having meticulously silenced his adversaries through intimidation, imprisonment, and execution, Orlanko is the most feared man in the kingdom.\n\nAnd he knows an arcane secret that puts Raesinia completely at his mercy.\n\nExposure would mean ruin, but Raesinia is determined to find a way to break herselfÃ¢â‚¬â€and her countryÃ¢â‚¬â€out of OrlankoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s iron grip. She finds unlikely allies in the returning war hero Janus bet Vhalnich, fresh from a brilliant campaign in the colony of Khandar, and his loyal deputies, Captain Marcus dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ivoire and Lieutenant Winter Ihernglass.\n\nAs Marcus and Winter struggle to find their places in the home they never thought they would see again, they help Janus and Raesinia set in motion events that could free Vordan from OrlankoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influenceÃ¢â‚¬â€at the price of throwing the nation into chaos. But with the people suffering under the DukeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tyranny, they intend to protect the kingdom with every power they can command, earthly or otherwise\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef1da9b24db102d67fafd07b6bf121cd43e3e83a","amp;dn":"Django+Wexler-The+Shadow+Campaigns+Series+1+%26amp%3B+2+%5BKoonbey%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef1da9b24db102d67fafd07b6bf121cd43e3e83a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,29,169,178,77,177,2,214,127,175,208,123,107,241,33,205,67,227,232,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
