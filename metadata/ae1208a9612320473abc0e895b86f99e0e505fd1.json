New routes to determinate biodiesel properties are proposed and the process how the raw material source, impurities and production practices can affect the quality of the biodiesel is analyzed. In relation to the utilization of biofuel, the performance of combustion engines fuelled by biodiesel and biodiesels blends are evaluated. The applications of glycerol, a byproduct of the biodiesel production process as a feedstock for biotechnological processes, and a key compound of the biorefinery of the future is also emphasized","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae1208a9612320473abc0e895b86f99e0e505fd1","amp;dn":"Biodiesel+-+Quality%2C+Emissions+and+By-Products","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae1208a9612320473abc0e895b86f99e0e505fd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,18,8,169,97,35,32,71,58,188,14,137,91,134,249,158,14,80,95,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
