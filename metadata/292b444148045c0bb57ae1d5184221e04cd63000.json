It is the band's only album with bassist Tas Danazoglou.\n\nLegalise Drugs &amp; Murder was released on March 31, 2012 at a special release party at the HMV Forum in London, England. The release was made as largely a teaser until the next Electric Wizard album was finished. Also at this show was the debut of then-new members Glenn Charman and Simon Poole. The statement &quot;Legalise Drugs and Murder&quot; originated from the inner booklet to Dopethrone.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll music by Oborn, except &quot;Black Masses&quot;, &quot;Turn Off Your Mind&quot; and &quot;The Nightchild&quot; by Oborn/Buckingham.
