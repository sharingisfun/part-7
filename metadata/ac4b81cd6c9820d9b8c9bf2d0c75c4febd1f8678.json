I guess, due to the adult genre, you already know what this is. Good for him is that all sheep of the sheep herd are female and he is man, er, ram enough to do it with all of them.\n\nUnfortunately, neither the shepherd Lars nor his sheepdog WÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½tan are happy with this scenario, so they try to catch him whenever possible.\n\nYour job is to help Sven by his activities, while avoiding Lars and WÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½tan. Once Sven has it done successfully with all females, the level completes.\n\nSometimes even an UFO is flying over the herd, abducting sheep, which are brought back later. And since the aliens can't differentiate between a sheep and a dog, sometimes WÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½tan is the victim, which is good for you. \n\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n\nMinimum Configuration:\n\n\n\n*** OS: Windows 98/2000/XP\n\n*** CPU: P350\n\n*** RAM: 128 MB \n\n*** Graphic card 32 MB \n\n*** 800 MB HDD Space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac4b81cd6c9820d9b8c9bf2d0c75c4febd1f8678","amp;dn":"Sven+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac4b81cd6c9820d9b8c9bf2d0c75c4febd1f8678","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,75,129,205,108,152,32,217,184,201,191,45,12,117,196,254,189,31,134,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
