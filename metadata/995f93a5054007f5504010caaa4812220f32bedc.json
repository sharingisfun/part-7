These three remarkable men-of-arms who rose from the gruesome hell of the First World War to become the finest generals of their generation during World War II redefined America's ideas of military leadership and brought forth a new generation of American soldier. Their efforts revealed to the world the grit and determination that would become synonymous with America in the post-war years.\r\nFilled with novel-worthy twists and turns, and set against the backdrop of the most dramatic moments of the twentieth century, The Generals is a powerful, action-packed book filled with marvelous surprises and insights into the lives of America's most celebrated warriors.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nWinston Groom is the beloved author of 14 previous books, including Forrest Gump; The Aviators; Conversations with the Enemy (nominated for a Pulitzer Prize); 1942: The Year That Tried Men's Souls; Vicksburg, 1863; and Shiloh, 1862.
