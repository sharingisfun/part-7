Educated at Eton and Oxford, Thesiger was repulsed by the softness and rigidity of Western life-&quot;the machines, the calling cards, the meticulously aligned streets.\n\n&quot; In the spirit of T. E. Lawrence, he set out to explore the deserts of Arabia, traveling among peoples who had never seen a European and considered it their duty to kill Christian infidels. His now-classic account is invaluable to understanding the modern Middle East.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c44964fc2da4eb12a1d3733544f2ee70c7b12172","amp;dn":"Arabian+Sands+by+Wilfred+Thesiger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c44964fc2da4eb12a1d3733544f2ee70c7b12172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,73,100,252,45,164,235,18,161,211,115,53,68,242,238,112,199,177,33,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
