Their disc &quot;Africa&quot; its from 1975, they have a great and powerful sound. Their music is a rock'n'roll with a very particular groove.\n The psychodelic music from Africa is very hard to find beacause a lot of material was lost between a war or another.\n Enjoy this rare material!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da05cffda6b3d82746461f1d949f0409c2d29a67","amp;dn":"Amanaz+-+Africa+%281975%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da05cffda6b3d82746461f1d949f0409c2d29a67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,5,207,253,166,179,216,39,70,70,31,29,148,159,4,9,194,210,154,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
