An innovation of the volume is that it covers Qumran scholarship in separate countries: the USA, Canada, Israel, France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Italy and the Eastern bloc. Each essay also carries a detailed bibliography for the respective country. Biographies of all the major scholars active in the field are briefly given as well. This book thereby exhaustively surveys past and present Qumran research, outlining its particular development in various circumstances and national contexts. For the first time, perspectives and information not recorded in any other publication are highlighted.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb6948a9ed407f78f9ab680dfc924a8e4d31995b","amp;dn":"Dimant%2C+ed.%3A+Dead+Sea+Scrolls+in+Scholarly+Perspective+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb6948a9ed407f78f9ab680dfc924a8e4d31995b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,105,72,169,237,64,127,120,249,171,104,13,252,146,74,142,77,49,153,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
