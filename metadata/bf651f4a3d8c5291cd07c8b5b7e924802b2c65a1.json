The book emphasizes the conceptual framework of image analysis and the effective use of image processing tools. It uses applications in a variety of fields to demonstrate and consolidate both specific and general concepts, and to build intuition, insight and understanding. Although the chapters are essentially self-contained they reference other chapters to form an integrated whole. Each chapter employs a pedagogical approach to ensure conceptual learning before introducing specific techniques and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtricks of the tradeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The book concentrates on a number of current research applications, and will present a detailed approach to each while emphasizing the applicability of techniques to other problems. The field of topics is wide, ranging from compressive (non-uniform) sampling in MRI, through automated retinal vessel analysis to 3-D ultrasound imaging and more. The book is amply illustrated with figures and applicable medical images. The reader will learn the techniques which experts in the field are currently employing and testing to solve particular research problems, and how they may be applied to other problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf651f4a3d8c5291cd07c8b5b7e924802b2c65a1","amp;dn":"Medical+Image+Processing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf651f4a3d8c5291cd07c8b5b7e924802b2c65a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,101,31,74,61,140,82,145,205,7,200,181,183,233,36,128,43,44,101,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
