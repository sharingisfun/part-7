Unapologetically premised on Hobbesian &quot;all that is social is war&quot; bromides, this account collects parables of strategic success and error from a diverse cast of military and nonmilitary historical figures. Its lessons are presented self-help-book style in chapters titled &quot;Maneuver Them into Weakness&quot; and &quot;Seem to Work for the Interests of Others While Furthering Your Own&quot; and flanked by a withering barrage of reiterative marginalia. Most books this cynical (and this repetitive) need a sense of humor to be readable, something this book apparently lacks. Its quasi-spiritual tone, though perhaps increasing its attractiveness to the impressionable, is also trying at times. But those readers who push through to the end (or flip ahead) will find a curiously contemporary section on modern terrorism cloaking a surprisingly specific commentary on al-Qaeda and antiterrorism strategy. Politics by other means?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec964bb26ea5d99a61250061961de7ca0e3ea1c9","amp;dn":"The+33+Strategies+of+War+-+Robert+Greene.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec964bb26ea5d99a61250061961de7ca0e3ea1c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,150,75,178,110,165,217,154,97,37,0,97,150,29,231,202,14,62,161,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
