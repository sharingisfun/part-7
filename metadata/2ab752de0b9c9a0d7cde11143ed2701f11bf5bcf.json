Born and raised in New York, Bibb has traveled the planet extensively. He describes the people of this earth at length here, conjuring their conflicts and hardships, as well as their compassion, tolerance and empathy. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jericho RoadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was produced by Glen Scott, a young Englishman originally from Jamaica endowed with outstanding talent and creativity. ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lavish musical arrangements and attention to sound make this new recording an exceptionally fine production. Eric gives a whole new meaning to the blues of the 21st Century, proving that the genre remains as lively and relevant as ever. Jericho Road is an event in itself, and a superlative album.\n\n\n\n \t\t00 Eric Bibb album art.JPG\t                          53.07 KB\n \t\t01 - DrinkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Gourd.mp3 320 kbps\t                   7.07 MB\n \t\t02 - Freedom Train.mp3 320 kbps\t                           7.94 MB\n \t\t03 - Let The Mothers Step Up.mp3 320 kbps\t           8.16 MB\n \t\t04 - Have A Heart.mp3 320 kbps\t                          10.38 MB\n \t\t05 - The Right Thing.mp3 320 kbps\t                   9.63 MB\n \t\t06 - Death Row Blues.mp3 320 kbps\t                   8.66 MB\n \t\t07 - CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Please Everybody.mp3 320 kbps\t          10.58 MB\n \t\t08 - The LordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Work.mp3 320 kbps\t                   8.10 MB\n \t\t09 - With My Maker I Am One.mp3 320 kbps\t          10.66 MB\n \t\t10 - They Know.mp3 320 kbps\t                           9.47 MB\n \t\t11 - She Got Mine.mp3 320 kbps\t                           5.86 MB\n \t\t12 - Good Like You.mp3 320 kbps\t                          10.15 MB\n \t\t13 - One Day At A Time.mp3 320 kbps\t                   6.73 MB\n \t\t14 - Now.mp3 320 kbps\t                                  11.03 MB\n \t\t15 - Nanibali.mp3 320 kbps\t                          10.25 MB\n \t\t16 - Currency Of Love (Bonus Track).mp3 320 kbps\t   8.68 MB\n \t\tEric Bibb - Jericho Road.m3u\t                           2.20 KB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ab752de0b9c9a0d7cde11143ed2701f11bf5bcf","amp;dn":"Eric+Bibb+-+Jericho+Road+%28320CBR%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ab752de0b9c9a0d7cde11143ed2701f11bf5bcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,183,82,222,11,156,154,13,124,222,17,20,62,210,112,31,17,191,91,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
