This fine set contains his earliest recordings for Modern, Sun Records, and his first sides for Duke, with Ike Turner (who was the one who spotted Parker and brought him to Modern Records), Matt Murphy, Pat Hare, and Bobby Bland assisting on various tracks. Among the highlights are the chugging &quot;Feelin' Good,&quot; the lean elegance of &quot;Mystery Train,&quot; the proto-rockabilly of &quot;Love Me Baby,&quot; and the driving &quot;I Wanna Ramble.&quot; For giving &quot;Mystery Train&quot; a definitive form and arrangement alone, Parker deserves a spot in the rock and blues pantheon. \n\n1 Little Junior Parker &amp; The Blue Flames -  You're My Angel 1:56     \n2 Little Junior Parker &amp; The Blue Flames -  \nBad Women Bad Whiskey 3:00 \n3 Bobby Bland &amp; Junior Parker  -  Love Me Baby 2:58 \n4 Little Junior's Blue Flames  -  Feelin' Good 2:56     \n5 Little Junior's Blue Flames  -  Fussin' And Fightin' Blues 2:58\n6 Little Junior's Blue Flames  -  Love Me Baby 2:34 \n7 Little Junior's Blue Flames  -  Mystery Train 2:20 \n8 Little Junior's Blue Flames  -  Feel So Bad 2:41 \n9 Little Junior's Blue Flames  -  Sittin' At The Bar 2:32 \n10 Little Junior's Blue Flames  -  Sittin' At The Window 2:00 \n11 Little Junior's Blue Flames  -  Sittin' Drinkin' And Thinkin' 3:08 \n12 &quot;Little Junior&quot; Parker Bill Johnson's Blue Flames  -  \nPlease Baby Blues 2:40 \n13 &quot;Little Junior&quot; Parker Bill Johnson's Blue Flames -  \nDirty Friend Blues 3:02 \n14 &quot;Little Junior&quot; Parker Bill Johnson's Blue Flames  -  \nCan't Understand 2:51 \n15 &quot;Little Junior&quot; Parker Bill Johnson's Blue Flames  -  \nSittin' Drinkin' And Thinkin' 2:41 \n16 Little Junior Parker Blue Flames Orchestra  -  \nCan You Tell Me Baby 2:52 \n17 Little Junior Parker Blue Flames Orchestra  -  Backtracking 2:35 \n18 Little Junior Parker Blue Flames Orchestra  -  I Wanna Ramble 2:49 \n19 Little Junior Parker And His Orchestra  -  Driving Me Mad 2:49\n 20 Little Junior Parker And His Orchestra  - \nThere Better Be No Feet 2:31 \n21 Little Junior Parker And His Orchestra  -  I'm Tender 2:43 \n22 Little Junior Parker And His Orchestra  -  Pretty Baby 2:32\n]\n\n\n\nPersonel\nBass- Hamp Simmons (tracks: 16 to 22) , Kenneth Banks  (tracks: 4 to 11) \nDrums - John Bowers (tracks: 4 to 12) , L.C.
