Rather than looking at night photography as an extension of daytime shooting with added complications, they embrace the unique challenges of nocturnal photography for the tremendous wealth of creative opportunities it offers. That`s just what this book does. But if the idea of setting out into the deep, dark night with just your camera (and maybe a cup of coffee) gets your creative juices flowing, dive right in.\n\nLance Keimig, one of the premier experts on night photography, has put together a comprehensive reference that will show you ways to capture images you never thought possible. If you have some experience with photography and have always wanted to try shooting at night, you`ll learn the basics for film or digital shooting. If you`re already a seasoned pro, you`ll learn to use sophisticated techniques such as light painting and drawing, stacking images to create long star trails, and more. A chapter on the history of night photography describes the materials and processes that made night photography possible, and introduces the photographers who have defined night photography as an artistic medium. A chapter on how to use popular software packages such as Lightroom and Photoshop specifically with night time shots shows you how to make the final adjustments to your nocturnal creations.\n\nYou can use the free acrobat reader to view this or;\n\nAdobe Acrobat X Pro;      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5961888&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5961888&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAdobe Acrobat 9 Pro;      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5628228&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5628228&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAdobe Acrobat 9 Pro Extended;      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5130222&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5130222&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b8203c2c1f5f4d4d4c823b3ba1751ddefa9fcdf","amp;dn":"NIGHT+PHOTOGRAPHY+-+FINDING+YOUR+WAY+IN+THE+DARK+%5Bthethingy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b8203c2c1f5f4d4d4c823b3ba1751ddefa9fcdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,130,3,194,193,245,244,212,212,200,35,179,186,23,81,221,239,169,252,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
