The book provides what might be termed 'an art history of Russia', and if the culture of any country is to be properly understood, an art history is just as essential as a social, economic or political history. In doing this, however, the actual work of art, be it building, picture or sculpture, is never lost sight of, and the products of the various ages as a whole as well as the individual works of art themselves, are all considered from an artistic as well as an historical point of view","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:416ad7adfb0dd378b0d77b452667e889aeea1e27","amp;dn":"Russian+Art+%28Pelican+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"416ad7adfb0dd378b0d77b452667e889aeea1e27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,106,215,173,251,13,211,120,176,215,123,69,38,103,232,137,174,234,30,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
