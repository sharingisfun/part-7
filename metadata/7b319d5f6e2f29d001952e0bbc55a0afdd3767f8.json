RushdieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crime? Blasphemy or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Islamophobia,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as it has come to be known. Since then we have seen worldwide violent Muslim protests over cartoons, blasphemy laws in Europe, prosecutions of notable opponents of Islamic terror like Oriana Fallaci and Geert Wilders, and the demonization of courageous opponents of Islamic imperialism and terror in the West. David Horowitz and Robert Spencer describe the origins of the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“IslamophobiaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as a coinage of the Muslim Brotherhood and show how the Brotherhood launched a campaign, by ginning up Ã¢â‚¬Å“IslamophobiaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as a hate crime, to stigmatize mention of such issues as radical IslamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s violence against women and murder of homosexuals, and the constant incitement of many imams to terrorism. The authors make the case that Ã¢â‚¬Å“IslamophobiaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a dagger aimed at the heart of free speech and also at the heart of our national security.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b319d5f6e2f29d001952e0bbc55a0afdd3767f8","amp;dn":"Islamophobia+by+Robert+Spencer+%26amp%3B+David+Horowitz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b319d5f6e2f29d001952e0bbc55a0afdd3767f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,49,157,95,110,47,41,208,1,149,46,11,188,85,160,175,221,55,103,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
