A discussion was had and it quickly became apparent that a lot of the events in the game werenâ€™t really firing â€“ ever. No heat waves, no crazy animals, no crashed ship parts.\r\n\r\nDoing some local testing, I realized how bad it was. Most of the events in the game would never fire.\r\n\r\nHoly crap!\r\n\r\nIâ€™ve fixed the issue and uploaded a patch to Steam. Your save games will be compatible. The new build is 0.14.1238 â€“ look for that number at the top left of the main menu to confirm youâ€™re running it.\r\n\r\nLook at it this way â€“ itâ€™s like releasing a juicy content patch!\r\n\r\nNote: I havenâ€™t updated the DRM-free download yet, Iâ€™ll do that when Iâ€™m a bit more certain the patch is still balanced.\r\n\r\nPatch notes:\r\n\r\n    Fix: Events never fire (except in some exceptional circumstances):\r\n        Infestation\r\n        Manhunter pack\r\n        Psychic ship part crash\r\n        Poison ship part crash\r\n        Animal insanity (single)\r\n        Eclipse\r\n        Solar flare\r\n        Psychic drone\r\n        Toxic fallout\r\n        Volcanic winter\r\n        Heatwave\r\n        Cold snap\r\n        Flashstorm\r\n        Short circuit\r\n        Crop blight\r\n        Alphabeavers\r\n        Psychic soothe\r\n        Refugee chased\r\n        Thrumbo passes\r\n    Fix: Storyteller incorrectly adjusts trader frequency in relation to ally count.\r\n    Fix: Threat cycle event maker sometimes queues events without enough points to actually fire them","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:587896cb7fd9cbc81ec1f2f151e9f8b0e54ece7e","amp;dn":"RimWorld+Alpha+14b+%280.14.1238%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"587896cb7fd9cbc81ec1f2f151e9f8b0e54ece7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,120,150,203,127,217,203,200,30,193,242,241,81,233,248,176,229,78,206,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
