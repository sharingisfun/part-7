The subjects of the latter have varied from cities to trees, shells, and other natural forms, but to all his work he brings an intense concern with structure and design, and with technical perfection displayed in precision of detail. FeiningerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love of precision in both its artistic and scientific aspects is not surprising since he was trained first (at the Bauhaus) as a cabinet-maker and then as an architect and began his photographic career as an architectural photographer. While acknowledging influences as diverse as Edward Weston and Man Ray, he has made a unique contribution through his mastery of extreme close-up and telephoto techniques, which enable him to capture forms and details not ordinarily recorded.\n\nMost of the pictures in FeiningerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most recent book. Roots of Art, are close-ups from nature, but there are also a number which interpret works of art. All are of impressively high quality and many are strikingly beautiful, though a disturbingly large proportion arc-similar toÃ¢â‚¬â€or even identical withÃ¢â‚¬â€photographs already published in, for example, FeiningerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Anatomy of Nature (1956) or Ralph HattersleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Andreas Feininger (1973). But the book cannot be judged by its artistic merits alone, since Feininger is concerned with more than just visual effect. His intention, he tells us, is to encourage the preservation of nature by calling attention to the unnoticed beauty of even the most ordinary objects: fishbones, for example, or pebbles or a bit of feather. This is laudable. But the method he has chosen for focusing our attention on these neglected formsÃ¢â‚¬â€it, indeed, they really are neglectedÃ¢â‚¬â€leads him to make verbal and pictorial statements which are. frankly, embarrassing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0873f057b864f9effd3e659abfac0f1487dcf304","amp;dn":"Roots+of+Art+by+Feininger+%28Art+Photo+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0873f057b864f9effd3e659abfac0f1487dcf304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,115,240,87,184,100,249,239,253,62,101,154,191,172,15,20,135,220,243,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
