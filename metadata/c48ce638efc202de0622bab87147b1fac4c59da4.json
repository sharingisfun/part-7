Primary among them are its woefully superficial analysis of the cultural forces that led to the ``war'' for the Plains and its curious pro-19th century U.S. Army bias. Other problems are the frequent use of quotes without citations and the practice of attributing feelings to groups of people. The book is well illustrated with reproductions from the Smithsonian and historical society archives; visuals are its strongest suit. Look elsewhere, though, for insight into this aspect of American history.-Colleen McDougall, Kayenta Boarding School, AZ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c48ce638efc202de0622bab87147b1fac4c59da4","amp;dn":"The+American+Indians+-+War+for+the+plains+%28History+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c48ce638efc202de0622bab87147b1fac4c59da4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,140,230,56,239,194,2,222,6,34,186,184,113,71,177,250,196,197,157,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
