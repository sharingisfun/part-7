The first 15 tracks are culled from his 1952 and 1953 sessions for Chance Records (including an alternate take of his first single, &quot;Lonesome Old Train&quot;), and some great harp work from Big Walter Horton on the instrumental &quot;Williamson Shuffle.&quot; Along with the surviving Chance material are stray singles for USA (an uptown version of &quot;Crossroads&quot; featuring a droning sax section), Colt (&quot;Set a Date&quot;), UK Decca (&quot;Got to Move&quot;), Spivey (&quot;Can't Hold Out&quot;) and a pair of sides shared with Sunnyland Slim (&quot;Sunnyland/Homesick Special&quot;). There are no real session dates or personnel information on here, and only scant liner notes only giving introductory information; the set also leaves off both sides of his 1960 Atomic H single and thus can't be a complete overview. But the music is just as fine as you could possibly ask for, grade-A Chicago blues chock full of raw slide guitar and Homesick's grainy vocals, making this the best overview of this artist's early work available on compact disc. - Review by Cub Koda, allmusic.com\n\n\n\nArtist: Homesick James\nTitle Of Album:Chicago Slide Guitar Legend\nLabel: Official 5253\nYear Of Release: 2000\nCountry:US\nGenre: Blues\nQuality: Flac (tracs)\nBitrate: Lossless\nTotal Time: 01:13:02\nTotal Size: 313,08 Mb \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
