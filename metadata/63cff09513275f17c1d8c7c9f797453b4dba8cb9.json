Applied Calculus of Variations for Engineers addresses this important mathematical area applicable to many engineering disciplines. Its unique, application-oriented approach sets it apart from the theoretical treatises of most texts, as it is aimed at enhancing the engineerâ€™s understanding of the topic.\r\n\r\nThis Second Edition text:\r\n\r\nContains new chapters discussing analytic solutions of variational problems and Lagrange-Hamilton equations of motion in depth\r\nProvides new sections detailing the boundary integral and finite element methods and their calculation techniques\r\nIncludes enlightening new examples, such as the compression of a beam, the optimal cross section of beam under bending force, the solution of Laplaceâ€™s equation, and Poissonâ€™s equation with various methods\r\n\r\nApplied Calculus of Variations for Engineers, Second Edition extends the collection of techniques aiding the engineer in the application of the concepts of the calculus of variations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63cff09513275f17c1d8c7c9f797453b4dba8cb9","amp;dn":"Applied+Calculus+of+Variations+for+Engineers+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63cff09513275f17c1d8c7c9f797453b4dba8cb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,207,240,149,19,39,95,23,193,216,199,201,247,151,69,59,77,186,140,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
