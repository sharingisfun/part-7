In 1960, he formed the Cumberland Three, which recorded three albums for Roulette. The following year, he joined the Kingston Trio, replacing Dave Guard, and stayed with them until 1967. His song &quot;Daydream Believer&quot; was a number one hit for the Monkees at the end of that year. Stewart traveled with Senator Robert Kennedy on his 1968 presidential campaign, an experience that affected him deeply. In 1969, he released his classic album California Bloodlines, the first of seven solo albums to reach the charts through 1980. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t95.64% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tPolydor\nCatalog:\t\t5273692\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Gold (Feat.
