It was originally serialized as a twelve-issue full-color limited series from 1997 to 1998 by the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics.\n\nThe series was four different stories of three issues each, each having its own artist, and each blending a different genre with prospective science-fiction:\n\n1. &quot;Lust For Life&quot; - horror-like (art by Frank Quitely - New X-Men)\n2. &quot;La Tormenta&quot; - crime-like (art by Warren Pleece - Hellblazer, Kinetic)\n3. &quot;Renegade&quot; - western-like (art by James Romberger - NYC Mech)\n4. &quot;Repro Man&quot; - romance-like (art by Steve Pugh - Animal Man)\n\nThe four stories follow the lives of a disjointed family, struggling to survive in the morally and socially decadent United States of 2020.  From symbiotic venereal diseases to exclusive human breeding facilities, the future never looked so bleak, or so hopeful. \n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8122f4b4c5ad40191fc2ee72eb91b5e5cdea0daf","amp;dn":"2020+Visions+%28DC+Comics+Vertigo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8122f4b4c5ad40191fc2ee72eb91b5e5cdea0daf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,34,244,180,197,173,64,25,31,194,238,114,235,145,181,229,205,234,13,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
