Financial journalist Gary Belsky and Cornell University psychology professor Thomas Gilovich contend the answers can be found--and the deficiencies remedied--with help from a relatively new science called behavioral economics. Still largely unknown outside academic circles, the field can be traced to research on the impact of rewards and punishments on human judgement and decision-making that first were undertaken at Jerusalem's Hebrew University some 30 years ago. \n\nIn Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes, Belsky and Gilovich update this pioneering work and show readers how to understand exactly why they invest, spend, and save as they do. More importantly, using examples that everyone can identify with and language that anyone can understand, the authors offer dozens of workable suggestions that can help readers manage their money better. &quot;We believe that by identifying the psychological causes behind many types of financial decisions,&quot; they write, &quot;you can effectively change your behaviour in ways that will ultimately put more money in your pocket and help you keep more of what you already have.&quot; --Howard Rothman,\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:228f9d63e761ed939eb3d74a0bab8ec0d3d343da","amp;dn":"Why+Smart+People+Make+Big+Money+Mistakes+and+How+to+Correct+Them","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"228f9d63e761ed939eb3d74a0bab8ec0d3d343da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,143,157,99,231,97,237,147,158,179,215,74,11,171,142,192,211,211,67,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
