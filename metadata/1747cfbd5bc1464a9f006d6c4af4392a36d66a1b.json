What you need is a solution to this puzzle that is not only guaranteed to work but also is simple enough to under- stand even if you're not a mathematical genius.\nThe problem of restoring a cube to solid colors on all 6 faces is very difficult -far more difficult than near1y any other popular puzzle. As a result many available solutions are also so difficult that understanding them is no easier than solving the puzzle itself. The purpose of this book is to present a complete, quick. step-by-step solution that is both straightforward and effective. No knowledge of mathematics is assumed or necessary.\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1747cfbd5bc1464a9f006d6c4af4392a36d66a1b","amp;dn":"+The+Simple+Solution+to+Rubik%27s+Cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1747cfbd5bc1464a9f006d6c4af4392a36d66a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,71,207,189,91,193,70,74,159,0,109,108,74,244,57,42,54,214,106,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
