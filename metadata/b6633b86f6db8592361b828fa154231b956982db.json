The technique and tradition of stir-frying, which is at once simple yet subtly complex, is as vital today as it has been for hundreds of yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€and is the key to quick and tasty meals.\n\n In Stir-Frying to the SkyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Edge, award-winning author Grace Young shares more than 100 classic stir-fry recipes that sizzle with heat and pop with flavor, from the great Cantonese stir-fry masters to the culinary customs of Sichuan, Hunan, Shanghai, Beijing, Fujian, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia, as well as other countries around the world. With more than eighty stunning full-color photographs, YoungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitive work illustrates the innumerable, easy-to-learn possibilities the technique offersÃ¢â‚¬â€dry stir-fries, moist stir-fries, clear stir-fries, velvet stir-friesÃ¢â‚¬â€and weaves the insights of Chinese cooking philosophy into the preparation of beloved dishes as Kung Pao Chicken, Stir-Fried Beef and Broccoli, Chicken Lo Mein with Ginger Mushrooms, and Dry-Fried Sichuan Beans.\n\n2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6633b86f6db8592361b828fa154231b956982db","amp;dn":"Stir-Frying+to+the+Sky%27s+Edge%3A+Ultimate+Guide+to+Mastery+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6633b86f6db8592361b828fa154231b956982db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,99,59,134,246,219,133,146,54,27,130,143,161,84,35,27,149,105,130,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
