Shape-change from a bulldozing rhino into a fire-breathing dragon.\nPandemonium! is a fast-paced 3D platformer with a freestyle camera that showcases the huge and brilliantly detailed worlds.\n\nOverview:\nNothing is worse than the fallout from a powerful magic spell thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been cast incorrectly. Unfortunately for Nikki, she gets to see the side effects of magic gone awry while attending a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wizards in TrainingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ seminar. Giant monsters, summoned by the spell, swallow her entire town. Now, Nikki and her three friends must make a journey to the Wishing Engine and be granted a wish to return everything back to normal.\n\nPandemonium! is a crazy action platformer that features the acrobatic duo of Nikki and Fargus. Nikki is a wizard's protege with amazing double-jump and somersaulting abilities that propel her to different platforms while avoiding treacherous obstacles in her path; Fargus is a jester with an unusual spinning attack move that enables him to eliminate his enemies. Together, Nikki, Fargus (and his sidekick Sid the puppet!) create total Pandemonium!\n\nInstall and Play.\n\nOther:\nGenre:........................................action / adventure / platformer\nDownload size:...........................145 MB\nRelease date:.............................June 30, 1997\nCompatible with:........................Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8)\nLanguages:................................English\nDeveloper / Publisher:................Crystal Dynamics / Square Enix\nGame modes:.............................single-player\nACCEPTANCE OF END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT REQUIRED TO PLAY\n\nSystem Requirements:\nMinimum system requirements:Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7, 1.8 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM (1 GB recommended), 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended), 1GB HDD, Mouse, Keyboard.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5c898e19c3941cee41a951ff143238d518cee2b","amp;dn":"Pandemonium%21+%5BVersion+1.0.0.13%5D%5BGOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5c898e19c3941cee41a951ff143238d518cee2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,200,152,225,156,57,65,206,228,26,149,31,241,67,35,141,81,140,238,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
