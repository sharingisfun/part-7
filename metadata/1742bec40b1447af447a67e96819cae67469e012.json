Dylan started his musical odyssey in 1959 and much of his best known work is from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest. Some of his songs, such as &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot; and &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin'&quot;, became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements. His song &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, released in July of 1965, was named &quot;The Greatest Song of All Time&quot; by Rolling Stone magazine in 2004, placing 1 in a list of 500 titles. Dylan remains an influential and popular artist; his most recent album of new songs, 2009's Together Through Life, reached no1 on the charts in the US, Britain, France and several other countries. \n\n\n76-2012[flac]\n\n\n1976 - Desire\n\n1978 - Street-Legal\n\n1979 - Slow Train Coming\n\n1980 - Saved\n\n1981 - Shot Of Love\n\n1983 - Infidels\n\n1985 - Empire Burlesque\n\n1986 - Knocked Out Loaded\n\n1988 - Down In The Groove\n\n1989 - Oh Mercy\n\n1992 - Good As I Been To You\n\n1993 - World Gone Wrong\n\n1997 - Time Out Of Mind\n\n2001 - Love And Theft\n\n2006 - Modern Times\n\n2009 - Christmas in the Heart\n\n2009 - Together Through Life\n\n2012-Tempest","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1742bec40b1447af447a67e96819cae67469e012","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan-Discography+Part+2%5B1976-2012%5D-Flac-Winker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1742bec40b1447af447a67e96819cae67469e012","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,66,190,196,11,20,71,175,68,122,103,233,104,25,202,230,116,105,224,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
