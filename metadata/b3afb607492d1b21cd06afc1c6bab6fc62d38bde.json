Originally written in 1970 as an Advisory Circular and last updated in 1999, this new FAA-H-8083-30 handbook replaces AC 65-9A and reflects current operating procedures, regulations, and equipment. This book was developed as the first of a series of three handbooks for persons preparing for mechanic certification with airframe or powerplant ratings, or both - those seeking an Aviation Maintenance Technician (AMT) Certificate, also called an A&amp;P license. An effective text for both students and instructors, this handbook will also serve as an invaluable reference guide for current technicians who wish to improve their knowledge. This edition contains information on mathematics, aircraft drawings, weight and balance, aircraft materials, processes and tools, physics, electricity, inspection, ground operations, and FAA regulations governing the certification and work of maintenance technicians. New to this edition is a section addressing how successful AMTs incorporate knowledge and awareness of ethics, professionalism, and human factors in the field. Includes colored charts, tables, full-color illustrations and photographs throughout, and an extensive glossary and index.\n\n\nCover, Preface, and Table of Contents (PDF)\nChapter 1: Mathematics (PDF)\nChapter 2: Aircraft Drawings (PDF)\nChapter 3: Physics (PDF)\nChapter 4: Aircraft Weight and Balance (PDF)\nChapter 5: Aircraft Materials, Processes, and Hardware (PDF)\nChapter 6: Aircraft Cleaning and Corrosion Control (PDF)\nChapter 7: Fluid Lines and Fittings (PDF)\nChapter 8: Chapter 8: Inspection Fundamentals (PDF)\nChapter 9: Hand Tools and Measuring Devices (PDF)\nChapter 10: Basic Electricity (PDF)\nChapter 11: Safety, Ground Operations, and Servicing (PDF)\nChapter 12: Publications, Forms, and Records (PDF)\nChapter 13: The Mechanic Certificate (PDF)\nChapter 14: Addendum/Human Factors (PDF)\nGlossary (PDF)\nIndex (PDF)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3afb607492d1b21cd06afc1c6bab6fc62d38bde","amp;dn":"Aviation+Maintenance+Technician+Handbook+-+General","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3afb607492d1b21cd06afc1c6bab6fc62d38bde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,175,182,7,73,45,27,33,205,6,175,193,198,186,182,252,98,211,139,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
