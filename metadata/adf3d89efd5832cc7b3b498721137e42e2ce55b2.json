But while Richard is pretty levelheaded, Malley tends to get into trouble. So Richard is only mildly surprised to discover that she's run off with a guy she met on the Internet in order to avoid being sent to boarding school in New Hampshire. Richard wants to go find her, and luckily he runs into what may be the perfect person to help him do just that: a ragged, one-eyed ex-governor of Florida named Skink. With Skink at the helm, the two set off across Florida in search of Richard's cousin. While Malley's character is not as fully developed as the others and the story seems highly improbable, Skink, a favorite character from Hiaasen's adult novels, is incredibly memorable. Whether it's diving in to a gator-infested river after a rogue canoe, getting his foot run over by a semi while trying to save a baby turtle, or hiding out in the sand to save the next turtle, Skink is always full of surprises. And like a cat with nine lives, one never knows how he'll make it out or what will happen next. One thing's for sure: readers will want to be along for the ride. Although the ending meanders, fans of Hiaasen's novels won't mind the detours one bit.Ã¢â‚¬â€Necia Blundy, formerly at Marlborough Public Library, MA\nReview\n&quot;The book itself is just a wonder, part love poem about the Florida wilds, part road-trip novel, and part thriller. The second half of the book is a nail-biter to rival Cape Fear. I love Hiaasen for adults. I love Hiaasen for kids. But most of all, I love this Hiaasen, which brings the two writers together in one book.&quot;  --Cory Doctorow\n\n&quot;Skink and Richard make quite a dangerous and entertaining duo in a story that careens perfectly from one crazy situation to the next. Reluctant readers (especially guys) will surrender themselves to this page turner. Cross your fingers that we havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen the last of Skink!&quot; -- Booklist, starred\n\n&quot;If you were pursuing your cousinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kidnapper across Florida, you would want a man like Skink at your side. Maybe.&quot; -- Kirkus Reviews","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adf3d89efd5832cc7b3b498721137e42e2ce55b2","amp;dn":"Carl+Hiaasen+-+Skink+-+No+Surrender","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adf3d89efd5832cc7b3b498721137e42e2ce55b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,243,216,158,253,88,50,204,123,59,73,135,33,19,126,66,226,206,85,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
