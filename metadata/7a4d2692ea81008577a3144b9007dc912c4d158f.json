The later versions of A/UX ran on the Macintosh II, Quadra and Centris series of machines as well as the SE/30. A/UX was first released in 1988, with the final version (3.1.1) released in 1995. A/UX required a 68k-based Macintosh with an FPU and a paged memory management unit (PMMU).\nThe operating system was based on UNIX System V Release 2.2, with some additional features from System V Releases 3 and 4, and 4.2 and 4.3 BSD. It was POSIX and System V Interface Definition (SVID) compliant and included TCP/IP networking from version 2 onward. There were rumors of a later version using OSF/1 as its primary code base, but this system was never released to the public, if it even existed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a4d2692ea81008577a3144b9007dc912c4d158f","amp;dn":"A%2FUX+%28Apple+UNIX+for+m68k+macs%29+version+3.0.1+%2B+3.1+update","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a4d2692ea81008577a3144b9007dc912c4d158f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,77,38,146,234,129,0,133,119,163,20,75,144,7,220,145,44,77,21,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
