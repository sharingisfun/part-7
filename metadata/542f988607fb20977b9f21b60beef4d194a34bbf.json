Under Levirate law, as delineated in the Book of Deuteronomy, Nissim has the duty and obligation to marry his brother's spouse on the death of his brother. Nissim is very fond of Rosa, and grows to love her. However, he is only eleven, and newly single Rosa is not interested in either child-rearing or remarriage, so she shoos him away. Quite a few years later, Nissim comes back with marriage in mind.\n\nBased on the life of writer-director Mizrahi's mother, the film addresses the implications of ancient religious tradition on modern life, particularly for women's rights. In dealing largely with an eleven-year-old Jewish boy's love for his young, widowed sister-in-law, MoshÃƒÂ© Mizrahi sticks to his theme and avoids religious or distaff proselytizing. He is a refreshingly professional craftsman who allows a viewer his own judgments.\n\n\nVideo: XviD, 528x400, 25.000 fps, 1521 Kbps, 01h18m24s\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 256 kbps\n\nVHSRip rough but watchable, Hebrew audio with English subtitles hardcoded\n\n\ncover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/xmbg65eaj/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/xmbg65eaj/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/mctixxvpx/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/mctixxvpx/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ihq4vdck5/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ihq4vdck5/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/7qxwvy9jp/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/7qxwvy9jp/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/fkyihchcl/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/fkyihchcl/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:542f988607fb20977b9f21b60beef4d194a34bbf","amp;dn":"I+Love+You+Rosa+%281972+-+Israel+-+%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%99+%D7%90%D7%95%D7%94%D7%91+%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%9A+%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%96%D7%94%29+Eng+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"542f988607fb20977b9f21b60beef4d194a34bbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,47,152,134,7,251,32,151,123,159,33,182,11,238,244,209,148,163,75,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
