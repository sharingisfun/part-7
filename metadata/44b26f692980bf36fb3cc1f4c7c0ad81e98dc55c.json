Compete in a &quot;Championship&quot;, &quot;Single Race&quot;, &quot;Time Trial&quot; and &quot;Pursue Mode&quot;.\n\n[edit] Game Modes\n\n    * In the &quot;Championship&quot; mode, the player is to race on 5 to 7 tracks, three laps each and to earn most points. The player advances to the next track if he comes at least 3rd. If after racing all tracks player earns most points, he advances to the next difficulty level. The levels are: Novice (5 tracks), Amateur (6 tracks), Pro (7 tracks) and Mirror (7 tracks mirrored).\n\n    * &quot;Single Race&quot; is just simple race, three laps with 5 opponents.\n    * In &quot;Time Trial&quot; player is to beat the high scores: lap time and track time. In this mode when you race once on a track, the way you raced is recorded to &quot;ghost&quot;, with which you will race to beat the highscore. &quot;Ghost&quot; is made so it does not spoil your race. You can share &quot;ghosts&quot; with your friends.\n    * In &quot;Pursue Mode&quot; every lap the last car to finish a lap is eliminated until a winner is found.\n\nIn every mode, on every track there are dynamic obstacles that can crash your vehicle and make you lose time to beat your opponents.\n\nAlso in every race best times for lap and track are saved for each track.\n\nEvery mode can be played in multiplayer.\n\n[edit] Vehicles\n\nThe vehicles include:\n\n    * Coop (Mini Cooper)\n    * Evac (green emergency jeep)\n    * Enforcer (NYPD police car)\n    * Redneck (loosely based on a Ford Mustang 68 coupe)\n    * School bus\n    * Bug (Volkswagen Beetle)\n    * Smoke (a Truck head)\n    * Banana (yellow Porsche)\n    * Monster (Monster Truck)\n    * Vegas ('71 Dodge Demon)\n    * Ignition\n\nThe last four cars in the list become available as soon as corresponding difficulty level is completed.
