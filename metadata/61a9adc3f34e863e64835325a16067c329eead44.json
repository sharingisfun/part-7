He also weaves in his usual brand Oscar WildeÃ¢â‚¬â€œworthy cultural criticism (the tragedy of HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Walk of Fame, for instance).\n\nWhether heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lacerating the musical Rent for its cutesy depicÃ‚Â­tion of AIDS or dealing with personal tragedy, his sharp obserÃ‚Â­vations and humoristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flair for the absurd will have you positively reveling in the power of negativity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61a9adc3f34e863e64835325a16067c329eead44","amp;dn":"Half+Empty+-+David+Rakoff.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61a9adc3f34e863e64835325a16067c329eead44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,169,173,195,243,78,134,62,100,131,83,37,161,96,103,195,41,238,173,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
