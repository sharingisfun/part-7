Smooth - Discography 1991-2011 [FLAC]\n\n\nA duo who crafted artful hip-hop in the 1990s, relying on Rock's smooth beats and clever soul and jazz-filled samples. Mt. Vernon, New Yorkers Pete Rock (a producer/DJ) and rapper C.L. Smooth emerged in 1992 as both a powerhouse performance duo and as prolific producers. Their 1992 album Mecca and the Soul Brother was a hip-hop classic with great cuts including &quot;They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)&quot; and &quot;Straighten It Out.&quot; They later collaborated with Mary J. Blige for a remix of her song &quot;Reminisce&quot; that effectively merged the two tracks in a re-edited hit. Their next album, The Main Ingredient, appeared in 1994, but they split for solo careers one year later. They also recorded many productions for both hip-hop acts and urban contemporary artists like Johnny Gill.\n\n\n1991 - All Souled Out\n1992 - Mecca and the Soul Brother\n1994 - The Main Ingredient\n1998 - Rare Tracks (Released only in Japan)\n2010 - Mecca and the Soul Brother [Deluxe Editon]\n2011 - The Main Ingredient [Deluxe Edition]\n\n\nEach album has artwork and rip logs.
