Directed by French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the film is based on a screenplay by Joss Whedon. With a budget of $70 million, Alien Resurrection was the first film in the Alien series to be filmed outside of England at Fox studios in Los Angeles, California.\n\nSet 200 years after the preceding installment, Alien 3, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is cloned and an Alien queen is surgically removed from her body. The United Systems Military hopes to breed Aliens to study and research on the spaceship USM Auriga, using human hosts kidnapped and delivered to them by a group of mercenaries. The Aliens escape their enclosures, while Ripley and the mercenaries attempt to escape and destroy the Auriga before it reaches its destination, Earth.\n\nAlien Resurrection was released on November 26, 1997 and received mixed reviews from film critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt &quot;there is not a single shot in the movie to fill one with wonder&quot;, while Desson Thomson of The Washington Post said the film &quot;satisfactorily recycles the great surprises that made the first movie so powerful&quot;.\n\n\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f42a643f5827fe94354cbdb46fd11ccff6d911f6","amp;dn":"Alien+Resurrection+1997++%28La+Clonazione%29+%5BBDrip+720p+-+H264+-+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f42a643f5827fe94354cbdb46fd11ccff6d911f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,42,100,63,88,39,254,148,53,76,189,180,111,209,28,207,246,217,17,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
