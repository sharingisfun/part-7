He has published numerous works of fiction, some of which were made into feature films. He was awarded the 1981 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his novel The Mosquito Coast on which the 1986 movie is based.\n\nHis first novel, Waldo, was published during his time in Uganda and was moderately successful. He published several more novels over the next few years, including Fong and the Indians and Jungle Lovers. On his return to Malawi many years later, he found that this latter novel, which was set in that country, was still banned, a story told in his book Dark Star Safari.\n\nAfter moving to London in 1972, Theroux set off on an epic journey by train from Great Britain to Japan and back. His account of this journey was published as The Great Railway Bazaar, his first major success as a travel writer and now a classic in the genre. He has since written a number of other travel books, including descriptions of traveling by train from Boston to Argentina (The Old Patagonian Express), walking around the United Kingdom (The Kingdom By The Sea), kayaking in the South Pacific (The Happy Isles Of Oceania), visiting China (Riding the Iron Rooster), and traveling from Cairo to Cape Town (Dark Star Safari). As a traveler he is noted for his rich descriptions of people and places, laced with a heavy streak of irony, or even misanthropy. Other non-fiction by Theroux includes Sir Vidia's Shadow, an account of his personal and professional friendship with Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul that ended abruptly after 30 years.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and all are in ePUB format unless otherwise stated:\n\n                                      Fiction\n\n* Blinding Light (2006)\n\n* Hotel Honolulu (2001) -- PDF\n\n* O-Zone (1986) -- PDF\n\n* Stranger at the Palazzo D'Oro &amp; other stories (2004)\n\n* The Black House (1974)\n\n* The Collected Stories (1997)\n\n* The Consul's File (1977)\n\n* The Family Arsenal (1976)\n \n* The Lower River (2012)\n\n* The Mosquito Coast (1981)\n\n                                      Non-Fiction\n\n\n* Dark Star Safari (2002)\n\n* Ghost Train to the Eastern Star (2008)\n\n* Riding the Iron Rooster (1988)\n\n* Sunrise with Seamonsters (1985)\n\n* The Great Railway Bazaar (1975)\n\n* The Happy Isles of Oceania (1992)\n\n* The Kingdom by the Sea (1983)\n\n* The Last Train to Zona Verde (2013)\n\n* The Old Patagonian Express (1979)\n\n* The Pillars of Hercules (1995)\n\n* The Tao of Travel (2011)\n\n* To the Ends of the Earth (1990)\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Theroux&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Theroux&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.paultheroux.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.paultheroux.com&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/05/130525-paul-theroux-africa-travel-last-train-to-zona-verde/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/05/130525-paul-theroux-africa-travel-last-train-to-zona-verde/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/blog/tag/paul-theroux/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/blog/tag/paul-theroux/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/09/artsfeatures.fiction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/09/artsfeatures.fiction&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eb007cb67d69ff618294237a8e294ddbf948f9b","amp;dn":"Paul+Theroux+-+Fiction+%26amp%3B+Non-Fiction+%2822+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eb007cb67d69ff618294237a8e294ddbf948f9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,176,7,203,103,214,159,246,24,41,66,55,168,226,148,221,191,148,143,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
