They all flared into brilliance at once, then disappeared, replaced by a flat, empty black barrier. He and his best friends, Jason and Diane Lawton, had seen what became known as the Big Blackout. It would shape their lives. \n\n&quot;This is the kind of book that makes me feel excited by science fiction all over again. It makes me want to jump up and down and say Ã¢â‚¬Å“Read it, read it, read it!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to all my friends.&quot;\n\nText enhanced/improved\n----------------------\nMarch 2014: v3.0 - Thorough read by DHR. Several dozen OCR errors corrected, such as &quot;Fuller of life man (-&gt; than) we ever imagined.&quot; or &quot;opened his mourn (-&gt; mouth)&quot;.
