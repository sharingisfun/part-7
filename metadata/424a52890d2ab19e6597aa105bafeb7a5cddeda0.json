Wishing to avenge his murdered family , our ward is involved in the middle of reckoning criminal world of New York and must face ruthless murderers , drug addicts , bad cops , corrupt politicians and other figures emerging from the darkness of terrifying realism , three-dimensional scenery. Extremely elaborate plot gradually reveals more secrets at a time when Max enters the darkest areas of the criminal underworld , where he must purify himself , from its allegations , and to discover and expose the dark web of betrayal and conspiracy.\n\nMax Payne has been designed with the aim of creating a new quality in the market action games , presented from the perspective of a third person. With a revolutionary system of fighting climate resembles a movie.

Unfortunately, his life returned to the past, ie watching for the life of our hero offender and Mona , a mysterious woman with whom Max has located its amorous feelings.\n\nThe whole plot was constructed in a manner reminiscent of the construction of crime movies from the 40s of the twentieth century (the Convention &quot; noir &quot; ), where we have one &quot;good&quot; protagonist , a woman ( femme fatale ) and the love story and a detective story full of many surprises and twists . Overall, the scenario Max Payne 2: The Fall Of Max Payne is three times larger than before, but the game itself has a similar length as the first installment . Told the story is deeper and more concise . While the &quot; single room &quot; storylines and the fight were separate parts , ie the player can steer clear of cutscenes and still reach the final all the fun , the &quot; talon &quot; everything has been merged together . Regardless of any changes in concept , we still have to deal with the title only for adults , which does not nullify the terrible scenes of violence , murder , etc.\n\nhardware requirements:\n========================\nPentium III 1.1 GHz , 256 MB RAM, 32 MB graphics card , Windows 98/ME/2000/XP\n\nDescription of the installation\n=======================\n1 Mount image or burn to disc\n2 Start the installation of the image &quot; Max_Payne.iso &quot;\n3 Install\n4 Then mount the image &quot; MAXPAYNE_NKK &quot; and install the crack\n5 Play (no crack ) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:424a52890d2ab19e6597aa105bafeb7a5cddeda0","amp;dn":"Max+Payne+Anthology+%5BMulti2%5D+%5BPL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"424a52890d2ab19e6597aa105bafeb7a5cddeda0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,74,82,137,13,42,177,158,101,151,170,16,91,175,235,122,92,221,237,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
