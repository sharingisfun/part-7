He must protect them from the bike gang that is terrorising them whilst transporting their entire fuel supply to safety.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082694/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082694/&lt;/a&gt;\n==========\n\n==Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome==\nBartertown is a city on the edge of a desert that has managed to retain some technology if no civilization. Max has his supplies stolen and must seek shelter there in a post apocalypse world where all machines have begun to break down and barbarians hold what is left. He becomes involved in a power struggle in this third Mad Max film where he must first survive the town, survive the desert and then rescue the innocent children he has discovered.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089530/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089530/&lt;/a&gt;\n==========\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4ad03946c721f979b92b8ae47278e7f373b5502","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Mad+Max+Trilogy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4ad03946c721f979b92b8ae47278e7f373b5502","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,173,3,148,108,114,31,151,155,146,184,174,71,39,142,127,55,59,85,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
