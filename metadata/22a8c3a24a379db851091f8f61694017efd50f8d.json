The band consisted of singer and rhythm guitarist Ric Ocasek, singer and bassist Benjamin Orr, guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson. The band originated from Boston, Massachusetts, and were signed to Elektra Records in 1977.\n\nThe Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synth-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flower in the early 1980s. Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone described The Cars' musical style by saying: &quot;they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trendsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power popÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.&quot;\n\nThe band broke up in 1988, and Ocasek has always discouraged talk of a reunion since then, flatly telling one interviewer in 1997 &quot;I'm saying never and you can count on that.&quot; Easton and Hawkes, however, joined with Todd Rundgren in 2005 to form a spin-off band, The New Cars, which performs classic Cars (and Rundgren) songs alongside new material on tour.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22a8c3a24a379db851091f8f61694017efd50f8d","amp;dn":"The+Cars+-+The+Very+Best+Of+CDRip+%5BCov%2BCD%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22a8c3a24a379db851091f8f61694017efd50f8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,168,195,162,74,55,157,184,81,9,31,143,97,105,64,23,239,213,15,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
