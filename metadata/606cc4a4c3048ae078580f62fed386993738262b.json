With Bill HardmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cutting, raw-edged trumpet and Johnny GriffinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gruff and coiling tenor, BlakeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s band was a looser, less defined, but more intense unit than it would become later with in-house composers like Benny Golson, Bobby Timmons, and Wayne Shorter.  When Blakey and Monk, longtime friends and associates, made this date playing some of MonkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s core material, the Messengers became virtually a Monk ensemble and one of the most inspired to record.  A year later, Griffin would be a regular member of MonkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quartet, and this disc demonstrates why. \n\nAMG:\nArt BlakeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Jazz Messengers With Thelonious Monk (1958) was one of a number of landmark projects that Monk (piano) would record during the remarkably prolific spring and summer of 1957.  In addition to this confab, he also documented the solo platter Thelonious Himself (1957), as well as MonkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s MusicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s (1957) with a septet, and even going toe to toe with another respective pair of his formidable contemporaries on Thelonious Monk With John Coltrane (1957) and Mulligan Meets Monk (1957).  However in this classic confrontation, Art Blakey (drums) and his concurrent Jazz Messengers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ featuring the talents of Johnny Griffin (tenor sax), Bill Hardman (trumpet), and Spanky Debrest (bass) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ play host to the pianist on his only sides for the venerable Atlantic record label.  As one might anticipate with an artist whose catalog almost single-handedly defines bebop, the vast majority of the cleverly chosen material consists of Monk standards.  While both co-leads rise to the occasion with thoroughly expressive performances throughout, this incarnation of the Jazz Messengers reveals a particularly potent support.  During ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEvidence,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Hardman unleashes a powerful lead into an equally inspired keyboard run of enthusiastic chord progressions and advanced phrasings from Monk.  GriffinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interminable bop mentality effortlessly punctuates ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn Walked BudÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as he almost immediately pounces into the free swinging melody with a verve that refuses to subside.  From BlakeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s boisterous opening to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue MonkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ right through to the single-note crescendo during the finale, the Jazz Messengers provide a lethargic propulsion that showcases the tuneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bluesy origins.  This directly contrasts the up-tempo charge of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRhythm-a-Ning. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The quirky-yet-catchy chorus bounces from the dual-lead horn section with the entire arrangement tautly bound by the understated Debrest and Blakey.  GriffinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPurple ShadesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a smartly syncopated blues that is more of a musical platform for the Jazz Messengers than for Monk.  That said, his opening solo alternately shimmers and shudders with Debrest as well as the two-piece brass section demonstrating its own pronounced capabilities over MonkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s counterpoint.  This European release contains an additional three full-length ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œalternate takesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEvidence,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue MonkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which in some ways bests the released version ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Mean You. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ These are the same supplementary sides that are included on the Rhino Records 1999 North American domestic CD reissue of this same title. \n\nPersonnel:\nArt Blakey (drums);\nThelonious Monk (piano);\nJohnny Griffin (tenor saxophone);\nBill Hardman (trumpet);\nSpanky DeBrest (bass)\n\nArt Blakey &amp; The Jazz Messengers w Thelonious Monk Tracks:\n01  Evidence 6:46\n02  In Walked Bud 6:39\n03  Blue Monk 7:54\n04  I Mean You 8:02\n05  Rhythm A Ning 7:20\n06  Purple Shades 7:48\n07  Evidence [alternate take] 5:30\n08  Blue Monk [alternate take] 6:59\n09  I Mean You [alternate take] 7:34\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:606cc4a4c3048ae078580f62fed386993738262b","amp;dn":"Art+Blakey+%26+The+Jazz+Messengers+w+Thelonious+Monk+%281957%29+%5BJazz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"606cc4a4c3048ae078580f62fed386993738262b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,108,196,164,195,4,138,224,120,88,15,98,254,211,134,153,55,56,38,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
