Using interviews, behind-the-scenes footage and action sequences from Lee's last (unfinished) film, Game of Death, Little paints a textured, complex portrait of the world's most famous action hero.  \n\nAmazing story of the Legend of Bruce Lee, 3 July 2002\n10/10\nAuthor: blazing_l from Queens, NY\n\nMan, I was shell shocked. I actually saw this on AMC for the first time and was blown away by the in-depth interviews with Bruce, not to mention his spectacular demonstrations. John Little gets big credit for putting this masterpiece together.\n\nI got so much more information about Bruce from this one. You really get to see him as a person, how his beliefs shaped Jeet Kun Do and how he applied it to life in general. Hearing Bruce speak shows how intelligent and philosophical he was, humble, very down to earth....a very likeable guy. It's such a shame to think what potential he would have had if he hadn't died in 1973. Hearing everyone from Linda to Kareem and others speak about him show what an impact he had on others...and not just kung fu. I had known that he defied tradition by teaching &quot;anyone&quot; kung fu and this shows Bruce was a great man. His belief in the &quot;way&quot; and &quot;no limitation as limitation&quot; is really thought provoking as well.\n\nThe creme de la creme was the hidden footage from Game of Death they discovered. Bruce's vision and his philosophy on what the different levels represented just made me respect him moreso. Plus, the outtakes of various fight scenes from his film shows his hard work ethic and determination in getting the scene down pat.\n\nOverall, I've been a big fan of Bruce Lee since I wore Osh Kosh an this made me admire him so much more. To anyone who wants to learn about Bruce, watch this one. To all his fans, I don't need to tell you what a gem &quot;A Warrior's Journey&quot; is.
