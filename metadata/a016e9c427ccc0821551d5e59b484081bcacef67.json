Mostly exclusives.\n\nAll games have had their mp3s converted to wav. which explains the larger file size. This is for Genplus GX compatability (and I think it allows for better audio quality?) so I can run these off my Wii and any other emulator I would assume. Cues made with SegaCueMaker. Everything runs perfectly as far as I can tell.\n\nGames (18):\nAndroid Assault\nFinal Fight CD\nKeio Flying Squadron\nLords of Thunder\nLunar: Eternal Blue\nLunar: the Silver Star\nNight Trap\nPopful Mail (hidden gem)\nRobo Aleste (MUSHA is better)\nSewer Shark\nShadowrun (in Japanese)\nShining Force CD\nSilpheed\nSnatcher (totally awesome)\nSol-Feace\nSonic CD\nSoul Star\nVay\n\n\nHave fun and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a016e9c427ccc0821551d5e59b484081bcacef67","amp;dn":"Sega+CD+Best+Games+Compilation+%5Bnuneral%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a016e9c427ccc0821551d5e59b484081bcacef67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,22,233,196,39,204,192,130,21,81,213,229,155,72,64,129,188,172,239,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
