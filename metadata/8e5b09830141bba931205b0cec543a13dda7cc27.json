Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWilliam Cuthbert Faulkner (born Falkner, September 25, 1897 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ July 6, 1962), also known as Will Faulkner, was an American writer and Nobel Prize laureate from Oxford, Mississippi. Faulkner worked in a variety of written media, including novels, short stories, a play, poetry, essays and screenplays. He is primarily known and acclaimed for his novels and short stories, many of which are set in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County, a setting Faulkner created based on Lafayette County, where he spent most of his life, and Holly Springs/Marshall County.\n\nFaulkner is one of the most important writers in both American literature generally and Southern literature specifically. Though his work was published as early as 1919, and largely during the 1920s and 1930s, Faulkner was relatively unknown until receiving the 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature. Two of his works, A Fable (1954) and his last novel The Reivers (1962), won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.\n\nIn 1998, the Modern Library ranked his 1929 novel The Sound and the Fury sixth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century; also on the list were As I Lay Dying (1930) and Light in August (1932). Absalom, Absalom! (1936) is often included on similar lists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e5b09830141bba931205b0cec543a13dda7cc27","amp;dn":"William+Faulkner+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e5b09830141bba931205b0cec543a13dda7cc27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,91,9,131,1,65,187,169,49,32,91,12,236,84,58,19,221,167,204,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
