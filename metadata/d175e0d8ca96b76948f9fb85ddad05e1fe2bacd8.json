Curtis stars as Julna, the rightful heir to a Middle Eastern throne. Kidnapped in infancy, Julna is raised as a thief by the roguish Yussef (Everett Sloane). Eventually, however, Julna's true identity is revealed, prompting him to lead a revolt against the evil, usurping Mustapha (Donald Randolph). Piper Laurie steals the show as Tina, a carnival contortionist who falls in love with Julna and helps him regain his throne (most of Laurie's trickier stunts were performed in long shot by a much heftier double). Fine escapist entertainment, The Prince Who Was a Thief secured major stardom for both its leading players. And no, this is not the film in which Tony Curtis utters the apocryphal line &quot;Yonduh lies duh castle of my faddah.&quot; \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043935/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043935/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4163971/the-prince-who-was-a-thief-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4163971/the-prince-who-was-a-thief-es&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:24:50\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480  4/3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1551 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,21 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d175e0d8ca96b76948f9fb85ddad05e1fe2bacd8","amp;dn":"The+Prince+Who+Was+a+Thief+%281951%29+Tony+Curtis+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d175e0d8ca96b76948f9fb85ddad05e1fe2bacd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,117,224,216,202,150,183,105,72,249,251,133,221,173,5,225,254,43,172,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
