Theodore Twombly, who works \nas a writer of computer-generated handwritten letters for clients, is an \nintroverted man on the verge of divorce from his long time love, Catherine. \nHe is hanging onto his marriage for dear life. Beyond his purely platonic \nrelationship with a long-time friend, the married Amy, Theodore is having \nproblems moving onto other satisfying female relationships, either \nromantically or even sexually. He eventually realizes he is falling for his \nconfidante who has become possibly his best friend, Samantha, the name he \nhas given to the artificial intelligence operating system that powers all his \npersonal technological devices. As Samantha is designed to cater to Theodore's \nneeds, she evolves to a point of falling for him as well. Beyond the fact \nthat Samantha does not have a body, they have to come up with ways of making \nthe relationship into one truly fulfilling in every component. Three of the \nmany questions that may arise are whether Theodore's relationship with \nSamantha is preventing him from having a more satisfying relationship with \na female human, whether a human and a computer operating system truly can \nbe bonded in all critical aspects, and whether Samantha's quick evolution \nmeans she will evolve even further to her own form of self-fulfilment.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Joaquin Phoenix.\n=&gt;-Amy Adams.\n=&gt;-Scarlett Johansson.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Spike Jonze.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Drama : Comedy : Sci-Fi.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2013.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.64 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 868 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 05 mn.\n=&gt;-Her 2013...................: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/\n=&gt;-Her 2013...................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/her/\n=&gt;-Her 2013...................: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/her/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 688.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1750 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 217 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53a456ddf754621f72aac1a33cc82868f21e2110","amp;dn":"Her+-+Sci-Fi+Drama+2013+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH246-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53a456ddf754621f72aac1a33cc82868f21e2110","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,164,86,221,247,84,98,31,114,170,193,163,60,200,40,104,242,30,33,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
