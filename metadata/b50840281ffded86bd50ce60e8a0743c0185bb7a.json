In each of the projects the physical landscape, its specific environment, and its rich history are revealed and celebrated. While many of the projects here use sustainable materials like rammed earth, Joy's primary interest is in the quality of the spaces he makes. He shows us how efficient and environmentally-sensitive architecture can emerge as a by-product from a quest for the timeless qualities that are always associated with great architecture. This volume contains photographs, narratives and descriptions of Joy's work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b50840281ffded86bd50ce60e8a0743c0185bb7a","amp;dn":"Rick+Joy+-+The+Desert+Works+%28Architecture+Design+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b50840281ffded86bd50ce60e8a0743c0185bb7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,8,64,40,31,253,237,134,189,80,206,96,232,160,116,60,1,133,187,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
