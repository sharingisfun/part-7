And perhaps the most\nimportant movie ever made to expose the mind of evil in what is man.\n\n\nThe key actor referred to as having a &quot;malicious personality&quot; even in\nhis humour especially, (by the young woman in the movie) is exposed as\na bitter, hateful, cruelly inane, retarded imbecile at the\nbusiness of human existentialism. He wants to do evil for its own sake\nand as the ultimate testament to his &quot;superior&quot; form of being that thinks\nthis way.\n\nWhy not murder - just for the thrill of it?\n\n\nWell, why not indeed. Thank goodness for the death penalty or\nthese minds might never relent- whenever the mood was to strike perhaps.\nBut then few of this mindset are wanting be so brazen in how they\nact out their perverse desires for the world to witness. Evil never\nwins at the end of it all - it never has and never will. As time will tell -\nyet - and in this I believe, forever more, amen!\n\n\nThis is from the ntsc movie version - so happy hunting if you require subtitles\nfor English language content - although this world would be a much better place\nif none were unable to articulate in this language as a bridge between all that\nis mankind - amen! \n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman (Jan 2012)\nmoviesbyrizzo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2d2763282d7bd9dcfa88b40fa34a9b40addee7f","amp;dn":"Rope+%281948%29+720p+XviD+HDTV+%28moviesbyrizzo%29+Hitchcock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2d2763282d7bd9dcfa88b40fa34a9b40addee7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,210,118,50,130,215,189,157,207,168,139,64,250,52,169,180,10,221,238,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
