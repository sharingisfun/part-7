Drew Parker (Aaron Orr) is a lonely small-town forest ranger whose life is transformed when he meets a stranded, injured hiker suffering from amnesia. Mark (Matthew Montgomery) has no memory of who he is or how he got there, and as he begins to recover the pieces of his former life, he and Drew form a close friendship that grows into love--one that is threatened when Mark&amp;#039;s past comes back to haunt him.\n\n\nNo subs\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6621fe68d011378aa65c7bc82949dc42ccf6511","amp;dn":"Gone+But+Not+Forgotten+%282003%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6621fe68d011378aa65c7bc82949dc42ccf6511","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,98,31,230,141,1,19,120,170,101,199,188,130,148,157,196,44,207,101,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
