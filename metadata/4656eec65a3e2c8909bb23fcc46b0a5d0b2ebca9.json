Dominated by Colin Blunstone's breathy vocals, choral backup harmonies, and Rod Argent's shining jazz- and classical-influenced organ and piano, the band sounded utterly unique for their era. Indeed, their material -- penned by either Argent or guitarist Chris White, with unexpected shifts from major to minor keys -- was perhaps too adventurous for the singles market. To this day, they're known primarily for their three big hit singles, &quot;She's Not There&quot; (1964), &quot;Tell Her No&quot; (1965), and &quot;Time of the Season&quot; (1969). Most listeners remain unaware that the group maintained a remarkably high quality of work for several years.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-zombies-p5908/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-zombies-p5908/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
