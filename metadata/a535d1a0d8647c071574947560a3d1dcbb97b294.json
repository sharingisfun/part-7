Which, to an author like Chuck Palahniuk, must sound like a challenge. PalahniukÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s third identity crisis (thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnovelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to you), Invisible Monsters, more than ably responds to this call to arms. Set once again in an all-too-familiar modern wasteland where social disease and self-hatred can do more damage than any potboiler-fiction bad guy, the tale focuses particularly on a group of drag queens and fashion models trekking cross-country to find themselves, looking everywhere from the bottom of a vial of Demerol to the end of a shotgun barrel. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a sort of Drugstore Cowboy-meets-Yentl affair, or a Hope-Crosby road movie with a skin graft and hormone-pill obsession, if you know what I mean.\n\nUm, yeah. Anyway, the Hollywood vibe doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop these comparisons. As with Fight Club and Survivor, the book is invested with a cinematic sweep, from the opening set piece, which takes off like a house afire (literally), to a host of filmic tics sprayed throughout the text: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFlash,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJump back,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJump way ahead,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFlash,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFlash,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFlash.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ You get the idea. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as if Palahniuk didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t write the thing but yanked it directly out of the Cineplex of his mindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eye. Does it succeed? Mostly. Still working on measuring out the proper dosages of his many writerly talents (equal parts potent imagery, nihilistic coolspeak, and doped-out craziness), Palahniuk every now and then loosens his grip on the story line, which at points becomes as hard to decipher as your local pill addictÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s medicine cabinet. However Invisible Monsters works best on a roller-coaster level. You donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop and count each slot on the track as youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going down the big hill. You throw up your hands and yell, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhee!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Bob Michaels\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nPalahniukÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s grotesque romp aims to skewer the ruthless superficiality of the fashion world and winds up with a tale as savagely glib as what it derides. Narrator Shannon McFarland, once a gorgeous fashion model, has been hideously disfigured in a mysterious drive-by shooting. Her jaw has been shot off, leaving her not only bereft of a career and boyfriend, but suddenly invisible to the world. Along comes no-nonsense, pill-popping diva Brandy Alexander, a resplendent, sassy, transgendered chick, who has modeled her body rearrangementÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the breast implants, the hair, the figureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½on what Shannon used to look like. Brandy suggests veils, high camp and no self-pity. Shannon wants revenge[ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦] Adding to the plotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s contrivances are the relentless flashbacks, heralded at the beginning of almost every paragraph with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJump back toÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pretentious device of using a fashion photographerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s commands (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFlash. Give me adoration. Flash. Give me a breakÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) to signpost the narratorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s epiphanies. Palahniuk writes like heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s overdosed on Details magazine. Though the absurd surprise ending may incite groans of disbelief, this book does have fun moments when campy banter tops the heroineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s flat, whiny bathos. (Sept.) FYI: The film of PalahniukÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s novel Fight Club will star Brad Pitt.\nCopyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a535d1a0d8647c071574947560a3d1dcbb97b294","amp;dn":"Invisible+Monsters%3A+A+Novel+-+Chuck+Palahniuk+%281999%29+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a535d1a0d8647c071574947560a3d1dcbb97b294","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,53,209,160,216,100,124,7,21,116,148,117,96,163,209,220,187,151,178,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
