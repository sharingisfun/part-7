We'll begin by examining photographs of various female hairstyles and discuss some elements and problems to look for when painting hair. Following this we'll create a sketch of our hairstyle in addition to painting in a base tone to form a silhouette of the hair. From there we'll continue to build on our silhouette by layering on mid-tones and high lights. \n\nAlong the way we'll focus on various points such colors, shapes, contrast and the environment to name a few. Once we have established the foundation for our hair, we'll begin the process of refining and detailing the overall hairstyle.
