Divided into two parts, the author introduces the basic theory of radio prediction before providing a step-by-step explanation of how this theory can be translated into real-life applications. In addition, the book presents up-to-date systems and methods to illustrate how these applications work in practice. This includes systems working in the HF bands and SHF. Furthermore, the author examines the performance of these systems, and also the effects of noise, interference and deliberate jamming, as well as the performance of jamming, detection and intercept systems. Particular attention is paid to the problems caused by Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIEDs).\n\nKey Features:\n\n    A practical handbook on the topic of radio communications and propagation\n    Written by an expert in both the civilian and military applications of the technology\n    Focuses on methods such as radio and radar jamming, and radio-controlled improvised explosive devices (IEDs)\n    Contains problems and solutions to clarify key topics\n\n\nHardcover: 398 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 2 edition (January 25, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470688718\nISBN-13: 978-0470688717\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Communications-Electronic-Warfare-Adrian-Graham/dp/0470688718/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372857300&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=communications+radar+and&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Communications-Electronic-Warfare-Adrian-Graham/dp/0470688718/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372857300&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=communications+radar+and&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f07bf982624836c77feb049b15eaab2e65d8c6a4","amp;dn":"Communications%2C+Radar+and+Electronic+Warfare+%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f07bf982624836c77feb049b15eaab2e65d8c6a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,123,249,130,98,72,54,199,127,235,4,155,21,234,171,46,101,216,198,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
