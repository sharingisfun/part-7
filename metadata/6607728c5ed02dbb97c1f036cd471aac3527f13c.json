We have done well by probing the mysteries of seeds, learning how to harvest and store them and coax them to germinate and grow abundantly to suit our needs. A bit more than 10,000 years ago, humankind learned that saving seeds and planting them in specially prepared gardens meant that we no longer had to wander through muddy slime in warm Mediterranean swamps to gather celery, nor did we have to stalk wild cabbages along the cold and windy Baltic coast. Thanks to sojourning pioneers who plied ancient trade routes and returned to Europe with seeds of a strange new tree, we no longer had to live in Kazakhstan to enjoy wild apples.\nSeed saving and agriculture birthed civilizations. By planting seeds, humans could more easily enjoy more types of food in greater quantity. which left them more leisure time. Sowing seeds that you've collected from your own plants offers exciting new possibilities for your gardening endeavors.\nLearn how to collect, save, and cultivate the seeds from more than 300 vegetables, herbs, fruits, flowers, trees, and shrubs. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fun! Authors Robert Gough and Cheryl Moore-Gough thoroughly explain every step in the seed-saving process. Descriptions of seed biology; tips on how to select plants for the best seeds; and advice on harvesting and cleaning, proper storage and care, and propagating and caring for new seedlings are all presented with clear, easy-to-follow instructions.
