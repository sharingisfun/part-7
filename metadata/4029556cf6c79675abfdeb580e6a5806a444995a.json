Although the importance of the advent of printing for the Western world has long been recognized, it was Elizabeth Eisenstein in her monumental, two-volume work, The Printing Press as an Agent of Change, who provided the first full-scale treatment of the subject. This illustrated and abridged edition provides a stimulating survey of the communications revolution of the fifteenth century. After summarizing the initial changes, and introducing the establishment of printing shops, it considers how printing effected three major cultural movements: the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the rise of modern science.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4029556cf6c79675abfdeb580e6a5806a444995a","amp;dn":"The+Printing+Revolution+in+Early+Modern+Europe+%28History+Ebook%29.p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4029556cf6c79675abfdeb580e6a5806a444995a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,41,85,108,246,199,150,117,171,253,235,88,14,106,88,6,164,68,153,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
