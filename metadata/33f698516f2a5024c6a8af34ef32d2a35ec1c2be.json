Age-old enmities and suspicions have turned the entire region into a powder keg ready to erupt at the slightest sparkÃ¢â‚¬â€a spark that Laurence and Temeraire may unwittingly provide, leaving Britain faced with new enemies just when they most desperately need allies instead.\n\nFor to the west, another, wider conflagration looms. Napoleon has turned on his former ally, the emperor Alexander of Russia, and is even now leading the largest army the world has ever seen to add that country to his list of conquests. It is there, outside the gates of Moscow, that a reunited Laurence and TemeraireÃ¢â‚¬â€along with some unexpected allies and old friendsÃ¢â‚¬â€will face their ultimate challenge...and learn whether or not there are stronger ties than memory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33f698516f2a5024c6a8af34ef32d2a35ec1c2be","amp;dn":"Blood+of+Tyrants+by+Naomi+Novik","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33f698516f2a5024c6a8af34ef32d2a35ec1c2be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,246,152,81,111,42,80,36,198,168,175,52,239,50,210,163,94,193,194,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
