Against them he sent his most formidable servant, Glaurung, a powerful spirit in the form of a huge wingless dragon of fire. Into this story of brutal conquest and flight, of forest hiding-places and pursuit, of resistance with lessening hope, the Dark Lord and the Dragon enter in direly articulate form. Sardonic and mocking, Glaurung manipulated the fates of TÃƒÂºrin and Nienor by lies of diabolic cunning and guile, and the curse of Morgoth was fulfilled.\n\nThe earliest versions of this story by J.R.R. Tolkien go back to the end of the First World War and the years that followed; but long afterwards, when The Lord of the Rings was finished, he wrote it anew and greatly enlarged it in complexities of motive and character: it became the dominant story in his later work on Middle-earth. But he could not bring it to a final and finished form. In this book Christopher Tolkien has constructed, after long study of the manuscripts, a coherent narrative without any editorial invention.\n\nNarrated by Christopher Tolkien &amp; Christoper Lee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:941f30c9499b89e49c51438b300253d30bb62364","amp;dn":"J.+R.+R.+Tolkien+-+2007+-+The+Children+of+Hurin+%5BV0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"941f30c9499b89e49c51438b300253d30bb62364","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,31,48,201,73,155,137,228,156,81,67,139,48,2,83,211,11,182,35,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
