Hot Tuna, for those of you who don't know, originally began as a splinter group of the phenomenally successful Jefferson Airplane. As the Airplane moved further and further into electric anthem political rock, guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and bassist Jack Casady decided they wanted to explore the blues roots underpinning the Airplane's origins. Hence Hot Tuna.\n\nThe blues are well represented on BURGERS, from the Reverend Gary Davis' &quot;True Religion&quot; to &quot;99 Year Blues&quot; and the whoop-and-holler Davis composition &quot;Let Us Get Together Right Down Here.&quot; Jorma remains in form on &quot;Highway Song,&quot; &quot;Sea Child,&quot; and &quot;Ode To Billy Dean,&quot; a Hot Tuna live performance staple. &quot;Sunny Day Strut&quot; by Kaukonen is a growly electric-blues piece that showcases Casady's talents. While Kaukonen is definitely an acquired taste as a vocalist, his scuffed voice adds another unique and instantly recognizable dimension to the sound that is Hot Tuna.\n\nJorma's dynamic finger-picking style and his virtuosity on the acoustic guitar had been well camouflaged since &quot;Embryonic Journey&quot; on the Airplane's SURREALISTIC PILLOW. &quot;Embryonic Journey&quot; is a beautiful 1:30 minute guitar minuet. On BURGERS he gives us &quot;Water Song,&quot; a more complex, polyrhythmic variation on a theme that is simply breathtaking.\n\nMuch of the fabric of BURGERS is contributed by blues violinist Papa John Creach, drummer Sammy Piazza and Casady as bassist. Hot Tuna comprises a freestanding rhythm section that moves in and out of improvisational jazz with an ease born of true musicianship. While never as successful as the Airplane, with it's more simple, spare, and clear sound, Hot Tuna is obviously a tighter and much more talented band.\n\nBy far the most well-known song on the album (and Hot Tun's only charted hit) is &quot;Keep On Truckin'&quot; a rockin' song which is as intimately identified with Hot Tuna as is the 1934 Buick Victoria that graces the cover.\n\nIn short, BURGERS has taste.[/quote]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/o7zHTLAxm5.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Hot Tuna - Burgers (RCA 2591-2-R)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Hot Tuna\nAlbum................: Burgers (RCA 2591-2-R)\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1972\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 101 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
