When converted to m2ts, this video container type allows many weaker spec machines to smoothly run the video file and is compatible with nearly all machines. \n\nBenefits: Can be copied directly onto PS3 systems via a flash drive USB that is at least 32Gb. ($20 as of 12-26-12) Fully HD 1080p quality. If your display screen for the PS3 is lower then 1080p, no worries. Nothing is affected or changed. Will run smooth with any screen specs. You can say it's backwards compatible.\n \nSize: 28GB rounding up. Actual is 27.4GB. (Large but worth the wait)\n \nOwner: Available to the public without charge. Please do not try to sell this as a side profit. This is a free source. \n \nSupport: You can help support by seeding for others or by purchasing the actual SAO series from Japan. Support the Developers and the others who want this awesome collection. \n \nSpecial Thanks: Author of Sword Art Online &quot;Kawahara, Reki&quot; and providers of the MKV series each week &quot;HorribleSubs&quot;. You are the main base and reason this could be created into an awesome set. Afterall, &quot;when life gives you lemons, make lemonade!&quot; If anyone, please thank them for their work!\n   \n           \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6df4afab23ee12d4cd5b2e4969fdc6a143ea159d","amp;dn":"Sword+Art+Online+%28Season+1%29+%5B1080p%5D+%28English+Subs%29+%5EAVCHD%5E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6df4afab23ee12d4cd5b2e4969fdc6a143ea159d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,244,175,171,35,238,18,212,205,91,46,73,105,253,198,161,67,234,21,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
