Please see the Autodesk Data Management system requirements for remote server installations for sharing content libraries and/or Vault data between multiple-users.\n\n(2) Inventor 2010 and AutoCAD Mechanical 2010 applications are each provided both as 32-bit applications and as 64-bit applications for installation and use on the corresponding operating system only. Autodesk Vault Explorer 2010 is a 32-bit application for installation and use on either a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system. (Both) The 32-bit and 64-bit versions of these applications are all provided together on the installation media.\n\n(3) Autodesk Inventor/AutoCAD Mechanical design applications and Autodesk Vault must all be the same language on a given computer. English versions of these applications will run on any language operating system. Versions of these applications in other languages will run on operating systems of that same language.\n\n(4) Autodesk Inventor 2010 has been optimized to take advantage of the SSE2 extended instruction sets supported on Pentium 4, AMD Athlon 64, and AMD Opteron processors. Inventor 2010 will not install on computers that do not support SSE2. Several utilities are available on the Internet that report CPUID, including supported instructions sets.\n\n(5) Autodesk recommends settings that allow Microsoft Windows to manage virtual memory, as needed. There should always be at least twice as much free hard disk space as system memory (RAM).\n\n(6) Please refer to the Autodesk published graphics card information.\n\n(7) OpenGL graphics hardware acceleration is available only in legacy feature support mode by Microsoft for Windows XP Professional only. Direct 3D is not recommended for use with Windows XP 32-bit with the 3GB memory switch on.\n\n(8) Inventor 2010 is available only on DVD media (or electronic download in some situations). CD media is no longer available. DVD-ROM drive is not required if installing using electronic download. However to accommodate the installation files, you will need 9 GB of hard disk space and an additional 16 GB of space for temporary files created during the installation.\n\n(9) The multimedia learning components of the Inventor Help system require that you have Adobe Flash Player 10 installed. If it's not already installed, download it from the Adobe website.\n\nsignup on at http://students8.autodesk.com/?nd=register voor Serial Number and Product Key","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ed4242f7b97da8ce3ef97e3d0e2edc50c5062d9","amp;dn":"AutoCAD+Inventor+2010+Student+Version+English+Win+32bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ed4242f7b97da8ce3ef97e3d0e2edc50c5062d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,212,36,47,123,151,218,140,227,239,151,227,208,226,237,197,12,80,98,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
