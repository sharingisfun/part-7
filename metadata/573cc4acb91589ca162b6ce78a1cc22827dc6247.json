For Charlie, the future is less clearly defined. A small-time hood, he works for his uncle, making collections and reclaiming bad debts. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably too nice to succeed. In love with a woman his uncle disapproves of (because of her epilepsy) and a friend of her cousin, Johnny Boy, a near psychotic whose trouble-making threatens them all Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t reconcile opposing values. A failed attempt to escape (to Brooklyn) moves them all a step closer to a bitter, almost preordained future.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070379/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070379/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Crime | Drama\niMDB Rating: 7,5/10 from 45 136 users\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\nStarring: Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, David Proval\n\n\nSource Used: Mean Streets 1973 1080p BluRay FLAC x264-CtrlHD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:573cc4acb91589ca162b6ce78a1cc22827dc6247","amp;dn":"Mean+Streets+1973+720p+BRRip+x264-PLAYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"573cc4acb91589ca162b6ce78a1cc22827dc6247","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,60,196,172,185,21,137,202,22,43,108,231,138,28,194,40,39,220,98,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
