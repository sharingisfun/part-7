Conkling (Marcel Dekker, 1985).pdf\r\n\r\nA perennial bestseller, Chemistry of Pyrotechnics and Explosives: Basic Principles and Theory, is simply the most definitive reference in this field. Author J.A. Conkling first covers the requisite background in chemistry, thermodynamics, and light emission, introduces oxidizing agents, fuels, binders, and retardants, then explores virtually every aspect of formulating pyrotechnics. Topics include the requirements for and preparation of high-energy mixtures, ignition and propagation, heat and delay compositions, and color and light production, including sparks, flitter, and glitter. The journal Pyrotechnica said this book &quot;...belongs on every pyrotechnist's bookshelf.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8917cb4edd56a2ae3e66645144558f4603117960","amp;dn":"Chemistry+of+Pyrotechnics+-+Basic+Principles+and+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8917cb4edd56a2ae3e66645144558f4603117960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,23,203,78,221,86,162,174,62,102,100,81,68,85,143,70,3,17,121,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
