Burton was killed in a tour bus accident on September 27, 1986, near Ljungby, Sweden during a European leg of shows. The tour bus skidded off an icy road and flipped over, Burton was thrown out of the window and the bus landed on top of him. When they tried to pull the bus back on the road, the cable snapped and the bus fell back in the ditch. Whether Cliff Burton was still alive before that happened remains unknown.\n\nThe video is a retrospective on the 3Ã‚Â½ years that Cliff Burton was in Metallica, presented as a collection of bootleg footage shot by fans, some professional filming and TV shots that were never used and some of his best bass solos, personal photos and live concerts.\n\nWith this video, the band tries to show the unique personality and style he had. Whilst ostensibly the film focuses on Burton, it also has given fans a rare glimpse of Metallica's less-documented early career. This contrasts sharply with the 'Metallica business' represented in the feature film Some Kind of Monster.\n\nFootage on this release includes:\n\nDetroit, April 4, 1986 - &quot;supporting Ozzy&quot;\nShot from the left of the stage.
