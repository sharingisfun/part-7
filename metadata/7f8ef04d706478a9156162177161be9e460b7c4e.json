This book tells the story of the ship and the 94 officers, gentlemen, midshipmen, marines and sailors who made that historical voyage with her. It is a lively account of who these men were, how they lived, where they slept, what they ate and, often, how they died. The Endeavour's story is well-researched and is illustrated with contemporary paintings, charts and drawings supplemented by photographs from the Endeavour replica ship, now on its first world voyage following in the wake of Captain James Cook. Antonia Macarthur is a maritime historian who specialises in the restoration and replication of historic ships. Her work to date includes the HMS Warrior 1860, HM Monitor M33 (Minerva) 1915 and the clipper ship, Cutty Sark. She was employed by the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, to research all aspects of below decks on James Cook's Endeavour and continued that work for the Endeavour Foundation to support the reconstruction of the replica Endeavour built in Fremantle, Western Australia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f8ef04d706478a9156162177161be9e460b7c4e","amp;dn":"His+Majesty%27s+Bark+Endeavour+%28Sea+History%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f8ef04d706478a9156162177161be9e460b7c4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,142,240,77,112,100,120,169,21,97,98,23,113,97,190,158,70,11,124,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
