Both are in epub and mobi from a retail source.\n\n\n1. The Devotion of Suspect X\n\ndescription:\n\nOne of JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-selling crime novelists makes his American debut in an atmospheric thriller about a desperate woman, Yasuko, who, craving a peaceful life with her daughter, Misato, kills her abusive lout of an ex-husband. The next-door neighbor, Ishigami, helps hide the body and improvises a cover-up. When the body is eventually found, however, determined investigator Kusanagi, with the help of Dr. Yukawa, a physicist who knew Ishigami in college, senses that something is amiss with YasukoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story. A cat-and-mouse, Dostoevsky-like investigation ensues. Higashino explores just how far a relationship built on a terrible event can last. Suggest to readers familiar with Natsuo Kirino (Real World, 2008), another Japanese master of psychological crime fiction, and Karin Fossum, whose Norway-set thrillers are also drenched in psychological terror.\n\n\n2. Salvation of a Saint\n\ndescription:\n\nIn 2011, The Devotion of Suspect X was a hit with critics and readers alike.  The first major English language publication from the most popular bestselling writer in Japan, it was acclaimed as &quot;stunning,&quot;Ã‚ï¿½ &quot;brilliant,&quot;Ã‚ï¿½ and &quot;ingenious.&quot;Ã‚ï¿½  Now physics professor Manabu Yukawa - Detective Galileo - returns in a new case of impossible murder, where instincts clash with facts and theory with reality.\n\nYoshitaka, who was about to leave his marriage and his wife, is poisoned by arsenic-laced coffee and dies.  His wife, Ayane, is the logical suspect - except that she was hundreds of miles away when he was murdered. The lead detective, Tokyo Police Detective Kusanagi, is immediately smitten with her and refuses to believe that she could have had anything to do with the crime.  His assistant, Kaoru Utsumi, however, is convinced Ayane is guilty.  While Utsumi's instincts tell her one thing, the facts of the case are another matter.  So she does what her boss has done for years when stymied - she calls upon Professor Manabu Yukawa.\n\nBut even the brilliant mind of Dr. Yukawa has trouble with this one, and he must somehow find a way to solve an impossible murder and capture a very real, very deadly murderer.\n\nSalvation of a Saint is Keigo Higashino at his mind-bending best, pitting emotion against fact in a beautifully plotted crime novel filled with twists and reverses that will astonish and surprise even the most attentive and jaded of listeners.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c69869ed2de323ddeab0a4d195ad64b3dabb6ebd","amp;dn":"Keigo+Higashino+-+Japanese+mysteries+%282+books%29%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c69869ed2de323ddeab0a4d195ad64b3dabb6ebd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,152,105,237,45,227,35,221,234,176,164,209,149,173,100,179,218,187,110,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
