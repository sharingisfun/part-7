There she meets a group of Irish women who, completely alone at Ellis Island, married Chinese men in the same predicament. But even as a new century dawns, New Yorkers still cling to their own kind, scorning children of mixed races.\n\nWhen the new mother's half-Chinese, half-Irish niece goes missing, Sarah knows that alerting the police will accomplish nothing, and seeks the one person she can turn to-Detective Sergeant Malloy.\n\nAnd when the missing girl is found dead in a Chinatown alley, Sarah and Malloy have ample suspects in her murder-from both sides of Canal Street.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88d496a726cc6513d2816d513e0e244120510aba","amp;dn":"Victoria+Thompson-Murder+in+Chinatown+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88d496a726cc6513d2816d513e0e244120510aba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,212,150,167,38,204,101,19,210,129,109,81,62,14,36,65,32,81,10,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
