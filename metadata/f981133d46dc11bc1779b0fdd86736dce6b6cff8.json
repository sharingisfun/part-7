When Heinrich Augsburg, a German officer fighting on the Eastern front, is killed, he finds himself reborn into this corrupt reality as one of the vampire elite. Renamed Requiem Vampire Knight, he explores the bizarre world of Resurrection and its terrifying vampire society - all the while looking for his lost love and one hope of redemption.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f981133d46dc11bc1779b0fdd86736dce6b6cff8","amp;dn":"Requiem_Vampire_Knight_v01_-_Resurrection_%282014%29_%28Digital%29_%28DR_%26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f981133d46dc11bc1779b0fdd86736dce6b6cff8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,129,19,61,70,220,17,188,23,121,176,253,216,103,54,220,230,182,207,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
