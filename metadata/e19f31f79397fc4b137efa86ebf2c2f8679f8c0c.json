In an effort to impress and frighten his young charge he informs his new prot?g?, Freddy that Night of the Living Dead was based on true events that occurred when a gas (2-4-5 Trioxin) was released into the morgue in the basement of a Pittsburgh VA hospital causing the bodies to jerk around as if they were alive. The military was able to get a handle on the situation and clean up the spill and the infected corpses. The story was leaked and the military said the movie could be made but they had to change the story around and say it was fictional. Through a clerical error, a few barrels, containing the Trioxin infected bodies, were shipped to the warehouse and have remained there for years. A skeptical Freddy doesn't buy it, so Frank takes him to the basement and shows him the barrels. Inside the barrel they see the now-mummified remains of the body and Freddy is scared about the barrel's durability. Frank reassures him of the solid military construction of the barrels by slapping it on the side, causing a leak of the gas, poisoning and knocking out the two as we see the glass on the lid break open and the body start to liquefy Frank and Freddy unwittingly inhale the chemical and release it into the warehouse. The vapours cause the dead a near by cemetery to re-animate as they go on a rampage through Louisville, Kentucky seeking their favourite food, brains.\nNow Freddies girlfriend &amp; friends are fighting to save him and there own lives from brain eating zombies.\n\nCREW\nDirector..........Dan O'Bannon\nWriter............Dan O'Bannon\nProducer..........John Daly\nSpecial Effects:..Fantasy II File Effects\nWizards INC\nMakeup Effects Labs\n\nCAST\nClu Gulager..........Burt Wilson \nJames Karen..........Frank \nDon Calfa............Ernie Kaltenbrunner \nThom Mathews.........Freddy \nBeverly Randolph.....Tina \nJohn Philbin.........Chuck \nJewel Shepard........Casey \nMiguel A.
