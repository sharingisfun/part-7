Sit down with Stephen Bassett, organizer of the CitizensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Hearing on UFO Disclosure in Washington, D.C., as he discusses the conference, which was also attended by six U.S. congressmen. Hear Chris Putnam, co-author of the bestselling book Ã¢â‚¬Å“Exo-Vaticana,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ talk about the VaticanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship to extraterrestrial phenomena, in an age where data show that more people believe in extraterrestrials than believe in God.
