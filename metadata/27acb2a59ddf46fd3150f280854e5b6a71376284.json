Both 1440px and 2048px-HD versions are provided.\n*Note: You can download both or only choose which version you'd prefer by deselecting the one you don't want when you add the torrent to your client software.  If you're adding the torrent via magnet link, you can deselect any undesired file in the list of files once the torrent has begun downloading.\n========================================================\n\n\nFrom The Writer Of Kick-Ass And The Artist Of Watchmen Comes A Collaboration Decades In The Making. Says Millar: 'Secret Service Is The Ramifications Of [How] America Is Struggling On The World Stage, Funding Is Being Seriously Undercut To Balance The Books And Some People Are Trying Their Best To Take Advantage Of The Fragile Global Situation. The Hero And Sidekick Guys Who Lead The Book Are, I Think, The Best Characters I've Written.'\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for these scans.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27acb2a59ddf46fd3150f280854e5b6a71376284","amp;dn":"Secret+Service+01-04+%281440px%2B2048px-HD%29+%28theProletariat-Novus%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27acb2a59ddf46fd3150f280854e5b6a71376284","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,172,178,165,157,223,70,253,49,80,242,128,133,78,91,106,113,55,98,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
