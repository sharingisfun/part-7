Earlier releases had largely been Well received. \n Fuck Humanity, a recording expressed by the band as a response to those individuals by declaring &quot;Debauchery has always been something unique. Some people missed the point, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why they can fuck off!&quot; \nBut does the newly revamped line-up of Mr. Kill on guitar, Mr. Debauchery for guitar and vocals (presumably founding member Thomas Gurrath), Mr. Death on drums, and Mr. Blood on bass, cement their claim as one of Germany's premiere death metal acts, or is this a unfortunate step backwards?\nAs usual the peeps will have the last word, you will like or you wont.
