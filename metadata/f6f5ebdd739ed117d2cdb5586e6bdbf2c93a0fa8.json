A common misconception about SOFAD is that it was a sell-out to the grunge movement of its time. The only song on the album that might pass as being grunge, however, is &quot;I Feel You,&quot; and only for its hard edge and raw emotion. The rest of the album has too much depth and complexity, both musically and lyrically, to be classified as a sub-genre of grunge music. Although the album contained some raunchy sounds, it maintained a spiritual aura from start to finish. In a year when bands like Pearl Jam and The Spin Doctors dominated the scene, Depeche Mode held themselves to a higher standard and forged a completely different sound.\n\nAlso somewhat of a misconception was that Depeche Mode abandoned their roots on this album. It was a departure in the sense that live drums and more guitars were incorporated into the music, but SOFAD was still part of the band's evolutionary process. Martin Gore had actually started sneaking guitars into the mix on Music For The Masses, with the guitar work becoming more pronounced on Violater. SOFAD became a bigger outlet for this side of the band. Also, the album elaborated on typical Depeche Mode themes. Lyrically speaking, it's arguably Martin Gore's most inspired songwriting.\n\nI consider SOFAD to be my favorite DM album. That's a strong statement coming from someone who loves everything from Speak &amp; Spell onwards. Unfortunately, SOFAD wasn't well received by the general public and many DM fans alike. Martin Gore stated at the time of its release that they wanted to challenge their listeners. It's not the kind of album everyone's supposed to like (DM fans included), but most people weren't up to the challenge.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nDepeche Mode - Songs of Faith and Devotion\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Depeche Mode\nAlbum................: Songs of Faith and Devotion\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1993\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 260kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
