Leonard - Simply Brilliant - 1800 Success Tips and Life Lessons from AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Top Personal and Business Coaches\n\nIntroduction\n&quot;What is wisdom today?\nIs wisdom a set of principles or laws?\nDoes wisdom come to the lucky individual with\ngood genes and smart memes?\nDoes wisdom come from a group with special\naccess to Ã¢â‚¬Å“the truth?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOr, is wisdom something that is alive, constantly\ndeveloping and evolving as we humans evolve?\n\nPerhaps weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never know. In fact, to study wisdom is\nperhaps to restrict it. I think IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather just benefit from\nwisdom, whatever its source. What youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be enjoying in\nthese pages is the collective wisdom (I suppose that term is\nredundant Ã¢â‚¬â€ I mean, how can wisdom be anything other\nthan collective?) of dozens of personal and professional\ncoaches who trained at Coach U. These coaches have come\nfrom virtually all personal and professional backgrounds:\nbusiness consultants, therapists, attorneys, physicians,\nministers, writers, educators and more. You name it and\ntheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been there. What they bring with them is what\ntheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned in their own experience Ã¢â‚¬â€ and what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve\nlearned from clients. In fact, coaches have coached over\n1,000,000 individuals worldwide since the profession got its\nstart in 1988 when I began training the first 12 coaches\nvia Coach U.\n\nOne of these first coaches was Sandy Vilas, who is now the\nowner and CEO of Coach U, the worldwide leader in\ncoach training. I am grateful to the coaches who\ngenerously shared their wisdom with us in these pages.&quot;\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
