Fists fly, limbs are lost and blood vessels burst in this tale of furious rivals, supernatural masters, walking corpses, and above all, raging kung fu! Kagan originally self-published seven issues of Infinite Kung Fu before teaming with Top Shelf to finish the story and publish the entire thing as one volume.  Gordon Liu wrote an introduction for the book and Colin Geddes provided a foreword.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d056721456a43729516e7c13bdbc9fd999a54aa","amp;dn":"Infinite+Kung+Fu+%282002%29+%28digital-Empire%29.cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d056721456a43729516e7c13bdbc9fd999a54aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,5,103,33,69,106,67,114,149,22,231,193,59,219,201,253,153,154,84,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
