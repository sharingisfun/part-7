This wry tale follows bumbling bureaucrat Walter F. Starbuck from Harvard to the Nixon White House to the penitentiary as Watergate's least known co-conspirator. But the humor turns dark when Vonnegut shines his spotlight on the cold hearts and calculated greed of the mighty, giving a razor-sharp edge to an unforgettable portait of power and politics in our times.\n\n\n\n\n\nGooD SeeDinG!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a5e1822c67c5c43929eeedb8820b4c68a94db59","amp;dn":"Kurt+Vonnegut+-+Jailbird+-+Unb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a5e1822c67c5c43929eeedb8820b4c68a94db59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,94,24,34,198,124,92,67,146,158,238,219,136,32,180,198,138,148,219,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
