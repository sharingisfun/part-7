Aptly titled &quot;The Daywalker&quot; it was performed at Gold Reef City's Lyric Theatre with all shows sold out! \nThe Daywalker sees this prodigious talent at his very best in what can only be described as a masterful performance. Trevor delves into a wide range of topics including the story of his life as a mixed race child growing up in South Africa. It's cutting edge, full of punchlines and twists all delivered in Trevor Noah's clean cut, no cursing style. \n\nA comedy spectacle and a truly unforgettable experience\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daea55b65a4eb6f1af03e06b87be347f9cef70b5","amp;dn":"Trevor+Noah+-+Daywalker+2-+South+African+Commedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daea55b65a4eb6f1af03e06b87be347f9cef70b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,234,85,182,90,78,182,241,175,3,224,107,135,190,52,127,156,239,112,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
