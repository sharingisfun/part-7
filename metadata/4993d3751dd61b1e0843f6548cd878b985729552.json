It includes revisions on chapters devoted to the physical principles of RFID systems and microprocessors, and supplies up-to-date details on relevant standards and regulations.\n\nTaking into account critical modern concerns, this handbook provides the latest information on:\n\n    -the use of RFID in ticketing and electronic passports;\n    -the security of RFID systems, explaining attacks on RFID systems and other security matters, such as transponder emulation and cloning, defence using cryptographic methods, and electronic article surveillance;\n    -frequency ranges and radio licensing regulations.\n\nThe text explores schematic circuits of simple transponders and readers, and includes new material on active and passive transponders, ISO/IEC 18000 family, ISO/IEC 15691 and 15692. It also describes the technical limits of RFID systems.\n\nA unique resource offering a complete overview of the large and varied world of RFID, Klaus FinkenzellerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s volume is useful for end-users of the technology as well as practitioners in auto ID and IT designers of RFID products.\nComputer and electronics engineers in security system development, microchip designers, and materials handling specialists benefit from this book, as do automation, industrial and transport engineers. Clear and thorough explanations also make this an excellent introduction to the topic for graduate level students in electronics and industrial engineering design.
