They borrowed heavily from funk but had a very different agenda; their music was more suited for contemplation than for parties. They combined synthesizers and drum machines with throbbing bass lines and unorthodox vocals to evoke a primordial world where the line between human and animal was blurred. The title of their fourth album, Big Night Music, might be the most succinct summation of their work: Shriekback's music was always an appropriate soundtrack for life in the dark, but with the emphasis on the possibilities rather than the dangers. Though often haunting, it was not gothic and harbored strains of pop and dance that rose to the surface from time to time. Still, however accessible they became, Shriekback cultivated an air of mystery that made them hard to pin down. Further complicating any evaluation of their career is the fact that they never made a single, brilliant album that concentrated all their strengths in one place; their best material is spread out across a decade during which they underwent a great deal of evolution.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tAlternative Rock\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Lined Up\n02.Clear Trails\n03.Accretions\n04.Sway\n05.Madness Into Method\n06.My Spine (Is The Bassline)\n07.Mothloop\n08.Sexthinkone\n09.Evaporation\n10.Kind Of Fascination\n11.Working On The Ground\n\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.Nemesis\n02.Hand On My Heart (12 inch Version)\n03.New Home\n04.Despite Dense Weed\n05.Midnight Maps\n06.Mercy Dash\n07.Malaria\n08.Under The Lights\n09.My Careful Hands\n10.Nerve (12 inch Version)\n11.Lines From The Library\n12.Fish Below The Ice (12 inch Version)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:489e0d7ef75604f19c7b33492d37e21ad1e743cd","amp;dn":"Shriekback+-+Natural+History+The+Very+Best+Of++%281994%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"489e0d7ef75604f19c7b33492d37e21ad1e743cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,158,13,126,247,86,4,241,156,123,51,73,45,55,226,26,209,231,67,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
