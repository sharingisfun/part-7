He is best known for his uptempo recording of 'Misty', from the album 'Soul Message'.\n\nOne of the top jazz organists to emerge on the scene after Jimmy Smith's initial success, Richard 'Groove' Holmes had perhaps the best left hand walking bass, and he could create an immense swing and groove, hence his nickname. Listen to the organ trio live recording of 'Living Soul' from the album 'Spicy' for an example of this.\n\nList of included albums:\n\n1961 Groovin' With Jug\n1961 That Healin' Feelin'\n1962 After Hours\n1962 Somethin' Special\n1964 Book Of The Blues Vol. 1\n1965 Soul Message\n1966 On Basie's Bandstand\n1966 Spicy\n1966 A Bowl Of Soul\n1967 Super Soul\n1967 Get Up And Get It!\n1967 Blue Groove\n1967 Soul Power\n1968 The Groover!\n1969 Workin' On A Groovy Thing\n1969 Welcome Home\n1970 Come Together\n1971 Comin' On Home\n1972 The Best Of\n1973 Night Glider\n1973 Giants Of The Organ In Concert\n1974 Giants Of The Organ Come Together\n1974 New Groove\n1975 Onsaya Joy\n1975 Six Million Dollar Man\n1976 I'm In The Mood For Love\n1977 Dancing In The Sun\n1980 Broadway\n1980 Ya Understand Me?\n\n----------\n\nMP3 format.
