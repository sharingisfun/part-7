As siege tactics became integral to success in war, generals employed the minds of engineers and scientists to develop tactics, and offensive and defensive technology to give them the edge over their enemies. The mathematician Archimedes was famously and very practically involved in the defense of Syracuse in 213-12 BC. Soldiers became highly skilled combat engineers.\nThe book tracks the amazing developments in siege warfare through a period of nine centuries and includes details of the evolution of the artillery of the era - spear- and stone-firing catapults. Full-color artwork, many drawings and plans, photographs of archeological finds and reconstructions support expert but accessible text in this fascinating study of a less familiar facet of the ancient art of war.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:804fabee3828a475d22ea236d23b49ec865677ea","amp;dn":"Besieged%2C+Siege+Warfare+in+the+Ancient+World+%28History+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"804fabee3828a475d22ea236d23b49ec865677ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,79,171,238,56,40,164,117,210,46,162,54,210,59,73,236,134,86,119,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
