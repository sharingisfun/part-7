ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a beautiful shining Utopia where all citizens can browse in peace and harmony with pages loading smoothly and quickly, layouts looking the same across browsers, and not a plug-in in sight. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have you believe, anyway. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no doubt that HTML5 contains a lot of good, but it also contains a lot of . . . well, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get to that. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to learn the truthabout HTML5.\n\nHTML5 is a mess. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also one of the most exciting technological advances perhaps ever (a big claim, especially for something I just described as a mess).\nThere are quite a few books, most of them excellent, on HTML5. Some cover the markup exclusively. Some cover markup and JavaScript APIs. Others still focus on a specific development challenge, such as games. This book is a little different. Rather than simply looking at the what and how of HTML5 (though it does that as well), it endeavors to explain the why and why not of HTML5. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a passionate, informed, opinionated critique of much of HTML5 to boot. Along the way, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn a great deal about HTML5 markup and additional HTML5 features such as the new\naudio and video elements, the Canvas element, the History API, and related features such as SVG. But ideally, most of all youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn to think critically about HTML5 as a tool and adopt the good parts, for good reasons, and ignore the less than useful parts, for the right reasons as well.Luke Stevens has written a book all web designers and developers who care about their code should read. So go ahead and read it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:892a61868755a75a7ed3779c44bfbfc5edd6c961","amp;dn":"The+Truth+About+HTML5+-+Apress+%282014%29+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"892a61868755a75a7ed3779c44bfbfc5edd6c961","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,42,97,134,135,85,167,90,126,211,119,156,68,191,191,197,237,214,201,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
