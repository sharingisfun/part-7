He grew up in Montreal, Spain, Mexico City, and Key Biscayne, Florida, and was raised solely by his mother from the age of 10 when his parents divorced.[1] Hart was a prodigy as a teenager. At 13, he sang for Tom Jones and recorded with Paul Anka in Las Vegas and, at 19, recorded demos with Billy Joel and Eric Clapton before signing to a major label at the age of 20.[2]\n\nCorey Hart's first album was recorded in Manchester, England in the spring of 1982. Released in 1983, First Offense, featured the US Top 10 hit songs &quot;Sunglasses at Night&quot; and &quot;It Ain't Enough&quot;. The album went platinum in both Canada and the United States.\n\nHis follow-up album was the chart-topping Boy in the Box. Boy in the Box reached diamond status in Canada (1 million copies sold), becoming only the second Canadian album to do so, after Bryan Adams' Reckless that same year. It featured the phenomenal radio hit &quot;Never Surrender,&quot; which was the #2 song in the year-end Canadian charts in 1985, finishing second only to &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot;, the Canadian charity single which also featured Hart. In fact, Hart became so popular that he was offered the role of Marty McFly in the film Back to the Future, which he turned down.[citation needed] (The role eventually went to another Canadian, Michael J. Fox while Hart focused on his music career.) Hart was also offered the lead songs &quot;The Heat Is On&quot; and &quot;Danger Zone&quot; for &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; and &quot;Top Gun&quot; soundtracks respectively, both of which he politely declined, stating his preference to record his own songs.\n\nHart continued to record music and his maturity reflected in his songwriting, though his commercial success in the United States began to wane with the advent of grunge rock. However, he continued to chart successfully in Canada throughout the 1990s. He amassed a total of 26 Top 30 hits in his native country.\n\nIn 2002, Hart returned to the studio to re-record &quot;Sunglasses At Night&quot;, which was remixed by engineers, Original 3. Released to club DJs that year, it became an instant smash on the international dance music charts.\n\nToday, Hart is based in the Bahamas with his wife, French-Canadian singer Julie Masse and their four children: daughters India, Dante and River and son Rain. Masse, born on June 3 1964, was the inspiration for Hart's song &quot;Third of June&quot;. Hart currently works primarily as a songwriter, writing music for his wife and other artists, including Celine Dion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Offense 1983\n\n\n\nFirst Offense is the debut album by Corey Hart. It featured the hit singles &quot;Sunglasses at Night&quot; (along with an award-winning music video) and the ballad &quot;It Ain't Enough&quot;. Hart was subsequently nominated for four Juno Awards and a Grammy Award for &quot;Best New Artist&quot;.\n\nAfter his first break in meeting Billy Joel in a New York recording studio, Corey Hart was signed to Aquarius Records and went to England to record his first album. Much of it was recorded at Revolution Recording Studios in Cheshire, where owner Andy Macpherson helped Hart acquire a mix of English musicians who were known for their work in other bands, including Gary Tibbs (Adam &amp; the Ants) on bass, Paul Burgess (10cc) on drums and Michael Hehir (Sad CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©) on guitar. Hehir would become a fulltime member of Hart's band for the next seven years. The album also features a cameo by Eric Clapton, playing the Dobro (Resonator guitar); a fact mentioned in Hart's early promotional materials.\n\nHart had completed the album by August 1983, minus &quot;Sunglasses at Night&quot; which had yet to be written. In a 1985 radio interview with CHUM-FM, Hart described how he had returned to Canada and then penned the song: &quot;I wrote 'Sunglasses' and I said to the record company &quot;I gotta do this song. I've just got to put it on the album&quot; because... it's just such an immediate song for me that when I wrote it, when I wrote the riff to that song, I said there's just something about it, some magic about this song. It was one of the only songs that I've written where I actually thought of the video at the time that I was writing it. I had that same gut feeling about 'Sunglasses' the minute I wrote it.&quot; The song, with its synth-driven beat and distinctive guitar, was added to the album and became the hit lead single, rising to #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts.\n\nThe other singles from the album included the ballad &quot;It Ain't Enough&quot; which became a Top-20 hit, &quot;She Got the Radio&quot; which features a lead saxophone and &quot;Lamp at Midnite&quot;. Hart would tour North America and subsequently Europe and Australia on the strength of the &quot;Sunglasses&quot; single.\n\nTwo versions of the album were released, with the Canadian edition (on Aquarius Records) featuring a black &amp; white photograph of Hart on the cover standing against a brick wall. The other edition (released on EMI) is more familiar as it is the cover used for all CD releases of the album and features a color close-up shot of Hart with stubble. The Canadian LP edition features an extra track &quot;Araby (She's Just a Girl)&quot;, which was not used on the EMI edition and has never been released on CD.\n\nIn the liner notes, Hart dedicated the album to his mother Mindy.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Sunglasses at Night&quot; \n2.\t&quot;Peruvian Lady&quot; \n3.\t&quot;Lamp at Midnite&quot; \n4.\t&quot;She Got the Radio&quot; \n5.\t&quot;It Ain't Enough&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Does She Love You&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Cheatin' in School&quot; \n8.\t&quot;World Is Fire&quot; \n9.\t&quot;At the Dance&quot; \n10.\t&quot;Jenny Fey&quot; \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBoy in the Box 1985\n\n\nBoy in the Box is an album by Corey Hart released in 1985, which spawned four hit singles.
