It's the start of the most exciting-and dangerous-time of year for the swampers, the month-long alligator season. During this 30 day window, swampers make most of their annual income culling gators. Follow these swampers through a time of year that is crucial to their survival: the 30-day alligator hunting season. At its core, this is a uniquely American story of a proud and skillful people fighting to maintain an ancient way of life in a rapidly modernizing world, despite the many perils and trials that stand in their way. \r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1747551/\r\n\r\nA Mix Of AVI and MP4\r\n\r\nEnjoy the show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f0fc4d0c0ab5714e3585974468911cddc54c575","amp;dn":"Swamp+People+-+Season+7+%5BHDTV%5D%5BMixed%5D+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f0fc4d0c0ab5714e3585974468911cddc54c575","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,15,196,208,192,171,87,20,227,88,89,116,70,137,17,205,220,84,197,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
