It would be his undoing, as Stalin was not pleased with part II of this epic. But Ivan the Terrible, Part I still stands as a magnificent, rich, and strange achievement. This is a &quot;composed&quot; film to make Hitchcock look slapdash; every frame is arranged with the eye of a painter or choreographer, the \nmise-en-sc&amp;egrave;ne so deliberately artificial that even the actors' bodies become elements of style. (They complained about contorting themselves to fit Eisenstein's designs.) If you don't believe movies can be art, this could be (and has been) dismissed as ludicrous. But Eisenstein's command of light and shadow becomes its own justification, as the fascinating court intrigue plays out in a series of dynamic, eye-filling scenes. This is not a political theorist, but a director drunk on pure cinema. --Robert Horton\n\nPart One of Sergei Eisenstein's two-part epic chronicling the life of the 16th Century Tsar, Ivan Grozny, is one of film's most artistic and absorbing creations. Over three years in the making, &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; features an operatic score by the esteemed Soviet composer Sergei Prokofiev. \n\nA true masterpiece of moviemaking by one of the greatest directors! Enjoy :)\n\nThis movie has english subtitles hardcoded\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, these torrents will NEVER DIE'\n\nSimply search for 'freakyflicks' \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:763302cdaa98027ba6130fc672c40f8d55a0942e","amp;dn":"Ivan+the+Terrible%3A+Part+I+%28Sergei+M.+Eisenstein%2C+1944%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"763302cdaa98027ba6130fc672c40f8d55a0942e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,51,2,205,170,152,2,123,166,19,15,198,114,196,15,141,85,160,148,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
