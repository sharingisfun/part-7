Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda's new leader, is activating his most trusted (and deadliest) terrorists to carry out his newest plot: to detonate a bomb inside one of the sixty-four commercial nuclear power plants in the U.S. in an attack ten times worse than 9/11, causing radiological fallout that would kill hundreds of thousands of innocent Americans.\n\n The President wants answers quickly, and after Kolt Raynor saved his life a few months earlier, he knows Delta Force is fully capable. But Kolt is on the verge of getting forced out of JSOC for disobeying orders in PakistanÃ¢â‚¬â€and when he's offered a slot in Tungsten, an ultra-secret deep-cover organization, he jumps at the chance. Now his task is to infiltrate al Qaeda and prevent this deep-cover terror cell from making their plot a reality before it's too late. In Full Assault Mode, former Delta Force commander Dalton Fury takes readers inside the world of undercover special operationsÃ¢â‚¬â€where every wrong step costs lives, and one minute might just be one minute too late . . .\n\n Chris Ryan - Osama \n\n Osama Bin Laden is dead.\n\n The President of the United States knows it. The world knows it. And SAS hero Joe Mansfield knows it. He was on the ground in Pakistan when it happened. He saw Seal Team 6 go in, and he saw them extract with their grisly cargo. He was in the right place at the right time.\n\n Or maybe, the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\n Because now, somebody wants Joe dead, and they're willing to do anything to make it happen. His world is violently dismantled. His family is targeted, his reputation destroyed. And as a mysterious and ruthless enemy plans a devastating terror attack on both sides of the Atlantic, Joe knows this: his only chance of survival is to find out what happened in Bin Laden's compound the night the Americans went in.\n\n But an unseen, menacing power has footprints it needs to cover. And it will stop at nothing to prevent him uncovering the sinister truth...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1c919219137e8731870cfd1d1b2712e34f0a65e","amp;dn":"Dalton+Fury+-+Full+Assault+Mode+%26amp%3B+Chris+Ryan+-+Osama+%28Reques","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1c919219137e8731870cfd1d1b2712e34f0a65e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,201,25,33,145,55,232,115,24,112,207,209,209,178,113,46,52,240,166,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
