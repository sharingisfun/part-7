After examining six existential themes explored repeatedly in Bergman's films--judgment, abandonment, suffering, shame, a visionary picture, and a turning toward or away from others--Jesse Kalin shows how these themes are expressed in eight of his films, including well known favorites such as Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal, Smiles of a Summer Night, and Fanny and Alexander. Other important but lesser known films covered include Naked Night, Shame, Cries and Whispers, and Scenes from a Marriage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79baa8662b8b87bce7fb894784b5c0269cf2373e","amp;dn":"The+Films+of+Ingmar+Bergman++%28book%29+-+Jesse+Kalin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79baa8662b8b87bce7fb894784b5c0269cf2373e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,186,168,102,43,139,135,188,231,251,137,71,132,181,192,38,156,242,55,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
