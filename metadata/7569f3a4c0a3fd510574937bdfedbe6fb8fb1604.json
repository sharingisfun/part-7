In this course, Steve Harris shows you how to modify a traditional desktop site's layout and content so that it displays elegantly on mobile screen sizes and responds to gestures and orientation changes. First, you'll learn how to set up a new mobile site in Muse and copy over text and images. Then look at different mobile navigation strategies (tabbed panels, slideshows, and more) and decide which one is right for youÃ¢â‚¬â€or create a totally unique system by combining existing navigation widgets. The course also shows you how to add additional content like buttons and video, and modify widgets from your desktop experience to better fit the mobile design. Plus, learn to preview, publish, and test the new mobile site.\nTopics include:\n\n    Adding a mobile version to your existing site\n    Responding to gestures and orientation changes\n    Setting up a mobile site\n    Exploring mobile navigation systems\n    Creating master pages\n    Embedding video content\n    Adding a desktop link\n    Adding slideshows\n    Publishing your mobile site\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7569f3a4c0a3fd510574937bdfedbe6fb8fb1604","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Designing+a+Mobile+Website+with+Muse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7569f3a4c0a3fd510574937bdfedbe6fb8fb1604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,105,243,164,192,163,253,81,5,116,147,123,223,237,190,111,184,251,22,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
