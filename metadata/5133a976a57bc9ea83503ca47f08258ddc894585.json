It may be the stuff of Hollywood legend, but the cowboy who inspired the novel and film is very real. Buck - master horseman, raconteur and philosopher - is a no-excuses cowboy who travels the world sharing a hard-won wisdom that is often more about human relationships than about horses.\r\n\r\nAs Buck says, 'Often instead of helping people with horse problems, I'm helping horses with people problems.' He possesses near magical abilities as he dramatically transforms horses - and people - with his deep understanding, compassion and respect.\r\n\r\nProduced in 2011 by Cedar Creek Productions.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 21 (~2400Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.41 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 82 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.48 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5133a976a57bc9ea83503ca47f08258ddc894585","amp;dn":"Buck.The.Real.Horse.Whisperer.720p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5133a976a57bc9ea83503ca47f08258ddc894585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,51,169,118,165,123,201,234,131,80,60,164,127,8,37,141,220,137,69,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
