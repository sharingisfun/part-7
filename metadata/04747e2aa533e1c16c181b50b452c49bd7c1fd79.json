It&amp;#039;s in mono, so this is the equivalent of 64 kbps. I listened to this format of the entire series on my iPod, and found quality satisfactory. Furthermore, I didn&amp;#039;t detect any ripping errors.\n\nEach audiobook is split into labeled chapters. This means that when you go into your Audiobook section of iTunes, you&amp;#039;ll see many chapters, not just the seven book titles. If this isn&amp;#039;t preferable to you, import the chapters into that Audiobook program for Mac for an easy conversion.\n\nSome technical data:\nMPEG-4 AAC LC, 64 kbps, 22050 Hz\n\n\nThe difference to other torrents is that these files have chapters (made using Apple&amp;#039;s ChapterTool), so you can listen to them in iTunes and on an iPod with the convenient chapters. For every chapter, the picture found in the books has been added as well.\n\n\nThe first three books are one file each, the other four are in two files. This results from a Limit in Apple&amp;#039;s Chapter Tool for 500 MB and another limit that some iPods have problems if the files are too long. The audiobooks have been tested on an iPod nano and iPod video (and iTunes 7 Mac and PC).\n\n\n\nPlease say thanks and enjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04747e2aa533e1c16c181b50b452c49bd7c1fd79","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+AudioBooks+1-7+Ipod+Ready%28Ch.+Bookmarks%29+w%2F+Chapter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04747e2aa533e1c16c181b50b452c49bd7c1fd79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,116,126,42,165,51,225,193,108,24,27,80,180,82,196,155,215,193,253,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
