Warriors describes powerful, magnetic personalities who have earned their place in the world's imagination, all prepared to die for what they believed in - whether it was God or gold, the pursuit of power and glory or a magnificent ideal. From Spartacus, the gladiator who brought Rome to its knees, this series combines absorbing drama with CGI to ask what were the motives, the strengths and even the weaknesses that drove these men to achieve what no one else had dared. The amazing stories of Napoleon, Hernan Cortez, Attila the Hun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and Richard the Lionheart are also included.\nThis is Drama Documentary, aka Heroes and Villains\n\n\n1)  Napoleon \nTwenty Four year-old Corsican refugee Napoleon Bonaparte is a lowly artillery captain in the French army at the siege of Toulon. Destitute and relying on his success in the new and dangerous revolutionary society, his mother and siblings become embroiled in Napoleon's struggle. The opponents are the English but the enemy are the revolutionaries authorities who seek to keep him in his place. Using his astonishing tactical mind, his sheer audacity and extraordinary military bravery, Napoleon emerges victorious and sets out on a path that would one day lead him to the throne of France\n\n2)  Shogun \nSamurai general Tokugawa Ieyasu became a towering figure of Japanese history by overthrowing the governing dynasty of Japan and becoming the Shogun (the supreme military leader) of Japan. Ieyasu's rise to power climaxes in the biggest Samurai battle in history, with 160,000 soldiers fighting for the future of Japan. On the way, there is a story of love for a reckless son, a politician in drag, a night-time Ninja attack, suicide and betrayal.\n\n3)  Spartacus \nSpartacus knew he faced impossible odds but he choose to ignore them. As the leader of the greatest rebellion the Roman Empire ever knew, his vision and bravery led his band of renegades to an incredibly victory over the supposedly invincible Roman legions, pushed the Empire to the brink of revolution and won immortal fame as an icon of the oppressed.\n\n4)  Cortes \nDrama documentary. In, 1519 the Spanish adventurer Hernan Cortes is supposed to have taken on the mighty Aztec empire with a handful of soldiers and 16 horses. The myth claims that the Aztec emperor, Montezuma, surrendered his empire because he believed Cortes to be a God. But a more accurate account suggests that the Conquistadors started a civil war in Central America, uniting an army of tribesmen who hated Aztec rule. Montezuma is revealed to be a sophisticated ruler.\n\n5)  Richard the Lionheart \nRichard the Lionheart takes place in 1192, in Jaffa, a vital strategic port on the coast of Palestine. The Christians are on the brink of defeat in their crusade against Saladin for control of the Holy Land. Richard the Lionheart staked his reputation on this final battle at Jaffa. With just a handful of knights and a few hundred infantrymen, he led an assault and gained a victory which cemented his position at the personification of the noble warrior king.\n\n6)  Attila the Hun \nAttila's name has passed into history of one of the most feared warriors of all time, synonymous with burning ambition and vengeful savagery. Attila the Hun's decision - a decision that few would make after a humiliating defeat - to attack Rome itself would be something the Roman Empire would never recover from.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/8731/w16r.jpg&quot;
