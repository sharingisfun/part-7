Guitarist Eddie Van Halen redefined what electric guitar could do, developing a blindingly fast technique with a variety of self-taught two-handed tapping, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and effects that mimicked the sounds of machines and animals. It was wildly inventive and over the top, equaled only by vocalist David Lee Roth, who brought the role of a metal singer to near-performance art standards. Roth wasn't blessed with great technique, unlike Eddie, but he had a flair for showmanship that was derived as much from lounge performers as Robert Plant. Together, they made Van Halen into the most popular American rock &amp; roll band of the late '70s and early '80s, and in the process set the template for hard rock and heavy metal for the '80s.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nReinventing Van Halen proved to be a tricky task, so Eddie Van Halen proceeded to reunite the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦a move so obvious it should have come as no surprise that it was easier said than done. Sammy Hagar was brought in for a 2004 hits album and an accompanying tour, a project that collapsed in acrimony so noxious that founding bassist Michael Anthony left with the Red Rocker. Eddie brought in his son Wolfgang as Anthony's replacement and began a prolonged courtship of David Lee Roth that first led to a tour, and then to this, A Different Kind of Truth, the band's first album in 14 years.\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.Tattoo\n02.She's The Woman\n03.You And Your Blues\n04.China Town\n05.Blood And Fire\n06.Bullethead\n07.As Is\n08.Honeybabysweetiedoll\n09.The Trouble With Never\n10.Outta Space\n11.Stay Frosty\n12.Big River\n13.Beats Workin'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00ab52a34882649ea7ee57bc6ff88e9d92b2d4e8","amp;dn":"Van+Halen+-+A+Different+Kind+Of+Truth+%282102%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00ab52a34882649ea7ee57bc6ff88e9d92b2d4e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,171,82,163,72,130,100,158,167,238,87,188,111,248,142,157,146,178,212,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
