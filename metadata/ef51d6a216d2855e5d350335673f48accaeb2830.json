And they certainly donâ€™t plan to kill her and bury her in their exquisite suburban garden. \r\nYet Andrew and Lydia Fitzsimons find themselves in this unfortunate situation. \r\nWhile Lydia does all she can to protect their innocent son Laurence and their social standing, her husband begins to falls apart.\r\nBut Laurence is not as naÃ¯ve as Lydia thinks. And his obsession with the dead girlâ€™s family may be the undoing of his own. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef51d6a216d2855e5d350335673f48accaeb2830","amp;dn":"Lying+in+Wait+-+Liz+Nugent+%5BEN+EPUB+AZW3%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef51d6a216d2855e5d350335673f48accaeb2830","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,81,214,162,22,210,133,94,93,53,3,53,103,63,72,172,202,235,40,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
