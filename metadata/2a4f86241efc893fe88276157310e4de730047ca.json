In this ingeniously funny collection of humorous riffs, those who thought Martin's gifts were confined to the screen will discover what readers of The New Yorker magazine already know: that Martin is a master of the written word. \n\nHilariously funny and intelligent in their skewering of the topic at hand, the audiobook's pieces, some of which first appeared in The New Yorker, feature Martin at his finest. \n\nWith a playwright's ear for dialogue, a sense of irony only Steve Martin could muster, and a first-class comic ability to perfectly time the punch line, Pure Drivel will have listeners crying with laughter, and marveling at the fact that in addition to all of his many talents, Steve Martin is also a superb writer.\n\nAudio CD\n\nPublisher: Simon &amp; Schuster Audio; Unabridged edition (November 20, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0743571533\nISBN-13: 978-0743571531\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
