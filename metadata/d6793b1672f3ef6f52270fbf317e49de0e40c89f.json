She has lived in the village for decades, ever since her husband, an idealistic young doctor, ran afoul of the sultanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grand vizier and arrived to serve the poor fishermen. Now mostly bedridden, she is attended by her constant servant Recep, a dwarfÃ¢â‚¬â€and the doctorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegitimate son. Despite mutual dependency, there is no love lost between mistress and servant, who have very different recollectionsÃ¢â‚¬â€and grievancesÃ¢â‚¬â€from the early years, before Cennethisar grew into a high-class resort surrounding the family house, now in shambles.\n \nThough eagerly anticipated, FatmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandchildren bring little consolation. The eldest, Faruk, a dissipated historian, wallows in alcohol as he laments his inability to tell the story of the past from the kaleidoscopic pieces he finds in the local archive; his sensitive leftist sister, NilgÃƒÂ¼n, has yet to discover the real-life consequences of highminded politics; and Metin, a high school nerd, tries to keep up with the lifestyle of his spoiled society schoolmates while he fantasizes about going to AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â€an unaffordable dream unless he can persuade his grandmother to tear down her house. \nBut it is RecepÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nephew Hasan, a high school dropout, lately fallen in with right-wing nationalists, who will draw the visiting family into the growing political cataclysm issuing from TurkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tumultuous century-long struggle for modernity. \n \nBy turns deeply moving, hilarious, and terrifying, Silent House pulses with the special energy of a great writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early work even as it offers beguiling evidence of the mature genius for which Orhan Pamuk would later be celebrated the world \n\nover.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6793b1672f3ef6f52270fbf317e49de0e40c89f","amp;dn":"Orhan+Pamuk+-+Silent+House+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6793b1672f3ef6f52270fbf317e49de0e40c89f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,121,59,22,114,243,239,111,82,39,15,191,49,126,73,222,14,64,200,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
