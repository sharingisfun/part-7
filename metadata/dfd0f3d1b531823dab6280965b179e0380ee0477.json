You can change update preferences in Steam's application settings for KSP. \n\nWARNING: It's very likely that parts, ships and/or saves created on previous versions will be incompatible with the latest release. Although we try to preserve saved data as much as we can during development, it is impossible to ensure backward-compatibility on every update, especially with modded installs, so please keep this in mind. If you encounter something that appears to be a bug, try again on a fresh installation and no addons.
