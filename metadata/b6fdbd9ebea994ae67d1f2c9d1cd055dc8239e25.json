For those unfamiliar with the intricacies of Pennsylvanian geography, the Pocono Mountains are a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains, and while seemingly isolated, stand only two hours from northern New Jersey and New York City by car. This juxtaposition of complete isolation and proximity to a bustling cultural center encapsulates Good Old WarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound perfectly. The trio might seem like another Fleet Foxes imitation, lurking on mountainsides searching for that perfect introspective catharsis, but Good Old War are much too worldly to fall into that niche. Where Fleet Foxes might sing, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLie to me if you will/At the top of Beringer Hill,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Good Old War demonstrates an awareness of their cosmopolitan audience in the real world by singing (on their first album), ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m going to Coney Island to have myself a dog.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Trapped inside the warmth of their vocal harmonies, the deftness of their guitar progressions, and the precision of their uptempo rhythms is the energy of youth.\n\nThe album has three tracks titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, bookending the album with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and placing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the middle of the album. They are short interlude songs, either leftover ideas or interesting little riffs that could not be expanded into full songs. The opening track is lush, demonstrating the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability to compose beautiful vocal harmonies and fun, bouncy rhythms. Aesthetically, the track seems to transport the listener to that Pocono Mountain cabin--or The Shire, take your pick--as the group warms up their voices and instruments. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inviting, warm, and a perfect demonstration of everything the group is capable of without actually giving anything away.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ gives nothing away because despite being an folk trio with limited instrumental capabilities, Good Old War manages to put out a lot of tracks without diluting the sound too much. As the band made an attempt to have every song on the album playable live, the variety on the album is little. Yet, the difference from quiet acoustic number ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy NameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s SorrowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to 1960s-influenced pop piece ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWoogie WoodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hood BoogieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, from the simple ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy Own Sinking ShipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to the infectious ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMaking My LifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which grows organically from a drum groove to include some of the best harmonies on the album and an almost danceable groove, is quite striking. This, coupled with the fact that nearly every song on the album is under three minutes, make the album digestible and enjoyable from start to finish.\n\nGood Old War is a rising star in the indie folk world, and consistency is their strong suit, as every song on the fifteen-track album ranges from good to fantastic. The listener is likely to come away singing the chorus of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy Own Sinking ShipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWorld WatchingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, imagining the vocal harmonies beneath them. And the release date couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be better; Good Old War is the indie fanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s feel-good summer album of 2010.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6fdbd9ebea994ae67d1f2c9d1cd055dc8239e25","amp;dn":"Good+Old+War...Good+Old+War%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6fdbd9ebea994ae67d1f2c9d1cd055dc8239e25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,253,189,158,190,169,148,174,103,209,242,201,209,205,5,93,200,35,158,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
