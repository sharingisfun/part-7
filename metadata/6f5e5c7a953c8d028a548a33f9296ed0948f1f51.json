The original files are are ape. Upon extracting them I noted the original ripper named the individual CD's a little differently than in the boxed set but it is not really a problem. The Apple Lossless conversions are also included for the convenience of people like me, Apple users.  The boxed set has apparently been out of print for quite a while and if you can find it new, it runs over $240. \n\nDan Fogelberg is one of those few songwriters that can blend great lyrics with wonderful music. His songs don't just tell a story they paint a picture. Although he's known for his top 40 hits he never compromised his standards when writing and producing his albums. This box set gives the listener a great feel of how his music progressed though the years.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nPORTRAIT - 4 CD Box Set\n\nReleased June 1997 by Legacy/Epic Records. \n\nDisc One: Hits\n\nPart Of The Plan\nThe Power Of Gold\nHeart Hotels\nLonger\nHard To Say\nLeader Of The Band\nSame Old Lang Syne\nRun For The Roses\nMake Love Stay\nMissing You\nThe Language Of Love\nBelieve In Me\nLonely In Love\nRhythm Of The Rain\nMagic Every Moment\nDon't Lose Heart\n\nDisc Two: Ballads\n\nTo The Morning\nStars\nWysteria\nSong From Half Mountain\nOld Tennessee\nNether Lands\nScarecrow's Dream\nSince You've Asked\nHearts And Crafts\nOnly The Heart May Know\nSweet Magnolia\nWindows And Walls\nSeeing You Again\nBones In The Sky\nThe Minstrel\nMountains To The Sea\nA Love Like This\n\nDisc Three: Rock &amp; Roll\n\nTullamore Dew\nPhoenix\nAs The Raven Flies\nThe River\nOnce Upon A Time\nTell Me To My Face\nWishing On The Moon\nEmpty Cages\nThe Innocent Age\nWhat You're Doing\nShe Don't Look Back\nAurora Nova\nThe Wild Places\nDemocracy\nA Voice For Peace\n\nDisc Four: Tales &amp; Travels\n\nNexus\nIllinois\nThe Last Nail\nDancing Shoes\nParis Nocturne\nBeggar's Game\nThe Reach\nTucson, Arizona (Gazette)\nGo Down Easy\nSutter's Mill\nSong For A Carpenter\nForefathers\nRiver Of Souls\nEver On","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f5e5c7a953c8d028a548a33f9296ed0948f1f51","amp;dn":"Dan+Fogelberg+-+Portrait+4+CD+Bot+%28ape%2BApple+Lossless%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f5e5c7a953c8d028a548a33f9296ed0948f1f51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,94,92,122,149,60,141,2,138,84,138,51,249,41,110,208,148,143,31,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
