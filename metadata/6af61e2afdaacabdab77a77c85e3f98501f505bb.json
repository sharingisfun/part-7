A History of the French New Wave Cinema offers a fresh look at the social, economic, and aesthetic mechanisms that shaped French film in the 1950s, as well as detailed studies of the most important New Wave movies of the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nRichard Neupert first tracks the precursors to New Wave cinema, showing how they provided blueprints for those who would follow. He then demonstrates that it was a core group of critics-turned-directors from the magazine Cahiers du CinÃƒÂ©maÃ¢â‚¬â€especially FranÃƒÂ§ois Truffaut, Claude Chabrol, and Jean-Luc GodardÃ¢â‚¬â€who really revealed that filmmaking was changing forever. Later, their cohorts Eric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, and Pierre Kast continued in their own unique ways to expand the range and depth of the New Wave. \n\nIn an exciting new chapter, Neupert explores the subgroup of French film practice known as the Left Bank Group, which included directors such as Alain Resnais and AgnÃƒÂ¨s Varda. With the addition of this new material and an updated conclusion, Neupert presents a comprehensive review of the stunning variety of movies to come out of this important era in filmmaking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6af61e2afdaacabdab77a77c85e3f98501f505bb","amp;dn":"A+History+of+the+French+New+Wave+Cinema+%28Fim+Movie+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6af61e2afdaacabdab77a77c85e3f98501f505bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,246,30,42,253,170,202,189,171,119,167,124,133,227,249,133,1,245,5,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
