ITÃ‚â€™S ABOUT TO BE REMINDED. A military revolt in southeastern Russia puts a former hard-line Soviet leader in command of a ballistic missile submarine and its arsenal of nuclear weapons. His goal: re-ignite the communist revolution, and recapture the might and glory of the fallen Soviet Union. Without warning, Russia, Japan, and the United States become hostages in a scheme of international nuclear blackmail. When the warheads start falling and people begin dying, no one can pretend that it's a bluff. As the earth rushes toward extinction, a lone U.S. Navy warship must penetrate the Siberian ice pack to destroy the submarine before it can destroy the world. It may already be too late.\n    ISBN13: 9780983008514\n    ISBN10: 0983008515\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5d39fc30d38ccc1fb4d849cac58433d1314cadf","amp;dn":"Jeff+Edwards+-+The+Seventh+Angel+%28For+fans+of+Tom+Clancy%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5d39fc30d38ccc1fb4d849cac58433d1314cadf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,211,159,195,13,56,204,193,251,77,132,156,172,88,67,61,19,20,202,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
