More than 56,000 British and Commonwealth aircrew and 600,000 Germans died in the course of the RAF's attempt to win the war by bombing. The struggle began in 1939 with a few score primitive Whitleys, Hampdens and Wellingtons, and ended six years later with 1,600 Lancasters, Halifaxes and Mosquitoes razing whole cities in a single night. Max Hastings traced the developments of area bombing using a wealth of documnets, letters, diaries and interviews with key surviving witnesses. Bomber Command is his classic account of one of the most controversial struggles of the war.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:039989f822e7a0a8bb9575b5826e7503c005e080","amp;dn":"Bomber+Command+by+Max+Hastings.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"039989f822e7a0a8bb9575b5826e7503c005e080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,153,137,248,34,231,160,168,187,149,117,181,130,110,117,3,192,5,224,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
