The series is set in Huntington, West Virginia.\n\nJamie's challenge is to see if he can get a whole community cooking again. He works with the school lunch ladies and local families to get everyone back in the kitchen and making tasty meals with fresh ingredients ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ no packets, no cheating. He's started a Food Revolution: to get people all over America to reconnect with their food and change the way they eat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4bd7d67d9b62cec4fc6bec492333c87b6def0d0","amp;dn":"Jamie+Olivers+Food+Revolution+S01E04","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4bd7d67d9b62cec4fc6bec492333c87b6def0d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,189,125,103,217,182,44,236,79,198,190,196,146,51,60,135,182,222,240,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
