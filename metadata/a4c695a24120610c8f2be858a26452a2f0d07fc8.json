It goes beneath the well known similarities between Stoic &quot;spiritual exercises&quot; and modern psychotherapy, to look at the cause of these similarities. These lie in the conceptual continuities that connect the Stoics and other ancient philosophies with the modern cultural framework underlying psychotherapy.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 266 pages\nPublisher: Karnac Books (June 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1780490232\nISBN-13: 978-1780490236\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4c695a24120610c8f2be858a26452a2f0d07fc8","amp;dn":"The+Historical+and+Philosophical+Context+of+Rational+Psychothera","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4c695a24120610c8f2be858a26452a2f0d07fc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,198,149,162,65,32,97,12,143,43,232,88,162,100,82,162,240,208,127,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
