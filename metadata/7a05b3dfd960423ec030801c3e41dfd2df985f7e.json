Four talented young cooks bravely attempt a challenge that often throws off trained professionals. Watching the first round, featuring fish filets and a sugary frozen treat, the judges are amazed by the level of maturity, poise and skill: And it's a very difficult choice deciding which rising culinary star will not get a chance to move on. There are some fun items in the second round baskets: cotton candy and French-fried onions. Then the two terrific teens who make it to the dessert round, and find movie-theater popcorn in the basket, put on a great show.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 02-Oct-2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a05b3dfd960423ec030801c3e41dfd2df985f7e","amp;dn":"Chopped.S13E04.No.Kidding.HDTV.x264-d0rks.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a05b3dfd960423ec030801c3e41dfd2df985f7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,5,179,223,217,96,66,62,192,48,128,28,62,65,223,210,223,152,95,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
