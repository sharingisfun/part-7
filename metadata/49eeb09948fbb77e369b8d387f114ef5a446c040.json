The Beatles released three months earlier on Vee-Jay Records.\n\nThe Beatles' Second Album went to number one on the album charts in the US, knocking off Meet the Beatles!, the first time an artist replaced themselves at number one on the US album charts.\n\nAll thirteen unique albums released by Capitol Records are included in the box set, eight of which were previously released in The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 and Volume 2. The set contains remastered mono and stereo versions of each album. Shortly after the initial announcement, Capitol Records revealed that the new remasters for the US versions of the albums are partially based on the original 1960s masters and the 2009 remasters released in The Beatles Stereo Box Set and The Beatles in Mono. Unique stereo and mono mixes prepared in the UK for US release are sourced from the original tapes.\n\nTrack Listing [US - REMASTER] [320k MP3]\n\nMONO &amp; STEREO - REMASTERS\n\n01. \t&quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; (Chuck Berry) \tGeorge \t2:44\n02. \t&quot;Thank You Girl&quot;   \tJohn \t2:04\n03. \t&quot;You Really Got a Hold on Me&quot; John George and Paul) \t2:58\n04. \t&quot;Devil in Her Heart&quot; eorge (with John and Paul) \t2:28\n05. \t&quot;Money (That's What I Want)&quot;  \tJohn George and Paul) \t2:47\n06. \t&quot;You Can't Do That&quot;   \tJohn  George and Paul) \t2:39\n07. \t&quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;  \tPaul \t2:00\n08. \t&quot;I Call Your Name&quot;   \tJohn \t2:09\n09. \t&quot;Please Mister Postman&quot;\tJohn (with Paul and George) \t2:37\n10. \t&quot;I'll Get You&quot;   \tPaul and John \t2:05\n11. \t&quot;She Loves You&quot;   \tJohn and Paul with George \t2:20","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49eeb09948fbb77e369b8d387f114ef5a446c040","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Beatles%27+Second+Album+%5BUS+-+REMASTER%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49eeb09948fbb77e369b8d387f114ef5a446c040","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,238,176,153,72,251,183,126,54,155,141,56,127,17,78,245,164,70,192,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
