A total of 397 units have so far been manufactured, with 325 ordered by Deutsche Bahn. \n\nThe four-car EMUs primarily operate on Germany-Austria routes, with 37 units introduced to the Munich Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Garmisch-Partenkirchen route in August 2013. Individual cars are coupled and articulated via shared bogies and have a top speed of 160 km/h (100mph). \n\nThe BR 442 Ã¢â‚¬ËœTalent 2Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ for Train Simulator is available in Deutsche Bahn Regio livery with grey and white accents, and features SiFa driver vigilance, AFB, PZB and LZB cab signalling, and passenger view. \n\nThe locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the DB BR 442 Ã¢â‚¬ËœTalent 2Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Munich Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Garmisch-Partenkirchen route (available separately and required to play these scenarios)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa3c8f73d960675a582858c64ca59627c05f12e4","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015%3A+DB+BR+442+%27Talent+2%27+EMU+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa3c8f73d960675a582858c64ca59627c05f12e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,60,143,115,217,96,103,90,88,40,88,198,76,165,150,39,192,95,18,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
