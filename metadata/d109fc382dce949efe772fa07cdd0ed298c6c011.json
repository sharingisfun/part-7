Dick induces an altered state and the 3-D sound effects make the Ã¢â‚¬Å“mind movieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feel like a real experience. As the listening meditator, vividly imagine yourself in the situations being described and participate by doing the processes that are part of the adventure.\n\nYou are staying in a small house at the beach, when an evening visitor turns out to be Michael, one of your Master teachers. He normally works with you during sleep but the beach has relaxed you enough to make direct communication possible. Michael claims he can make your life easier by conducting some self-awareness processing in which you relate his words to your life. As the meditation progresses, he directs you to experience an ancient Mayan healing ceremony and then guides you through one of your highly-evolved past lives. Powerful lessons are learned. On the last track, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be back at the beach merging your consciousness with that of a seagull. You will awaken rejuvenated and inspired to be more than you are.\n\nThis program is divided into five tracks, so you can experience the various segments any way you want after taking the initial journey.\n\nThese Meditation Journeys are divided into multi-tracks, making them easy to listen to one at a time.\n\nDick Sutphen's Teachings &amp; Self-Awareness Processing in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“JourneyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Format. By dividing the meditation journey into multi-tracks, you can experience it any way you desire. As examples: 1. You can skip the body relaxation/altered-state induction while driving and simply listen to the story. participating to any degree you desire when instructed to consider a particular concept. 2. If you don't want to meditate for the full length of the CD/audio program, you can set your player to play onlyr Tracks 1 through 5 and the awakening track. The next time you do the meditation set your player to play Track 1 (relaxation) plus Track 6 through the end to finish the journey. If you like a particular portion of the journey, you can re-experience it as often as you like.\n\nMP3 - 192 kbps - CBR\n\nSource: WebRip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d109fc382dce949efe772fa07cdd0ed298c6c011","amp;dn":"The+Visit+Meditation+Journey+with+Dick+Sutphen+%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d109fc382dce949efe772fa07cdd0ed298c6c011","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,9,252,56,45,206,148,158,254,119,47,160,124,221,14,210,152,198,192,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
