Then, as now, the German mark was one of the most trusted currencies in the world. \n\nYet the early years of the Weimar Republic in Germany witnessed the most calamitous meltdown of a developed economy in modern times. The Downfall of Money will tell anew the dramatic story of the hyperinflation that saw the markÃ¢â‚¬â€worth 4.2 to the dollar in 1914Ã¢â‚¬â€plunge until it traded at over 4 trillion to 1 by the autumn of 1923.\n\nThe story of the Weimar RepublicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s financial crisis clearly resonates today, when the world is again anxious about what money is, what it means, and how we can judge if its value is true. It is a trajectory of events uncomfortably relevant for our own uncertain world.\n\nFrederick TaylorÃ¢â‚¬â€one of the leading historians of Germany writing todayÃ¢â‚¬â€ explores the causes of the crisis and what the collapse meant to ordinary people and traces its connection to the dark decades that followed. Drawing on a wide range of sources and accessibly presenting vast amounts of research, The Downfall of Money is a timely and chilling exploration of a haunting episode in history.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | Economics | History | Politics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61193d53c07ce291d1ad8ee3fa073436f5f1e02c","amp;dn":"The+Downfall+of+Money+by+Frederick+Taylor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61193d53c07ce291d1ad8ee3fa073436f5f1e02c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,25,61,83,192,124,226,145,209,173,142,227,250,7,52,54,245,241,224,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
