It was released on iTunes and contains most of the stuff from their old EPs back from 2011-2012. It's all in a neat official package so that's cool. 256 kbps. Don't know if it's constant or whatever. Joint stereo. Yeah so there you go. if you want the original EPs their on TPB already so go get em.
