But a trip to Scotland and one gorgeous phantom are about to prove her dead wrong . . .\n\nA self-employed tour guide, Mara is weary from leading her charges all over London. So she takes a breather at an antique shopÃ¢â‚¬â€and spots perhaps the handsomest bed ever. Then she bumps into the handsomest man ever. He has a sexy Scottish burr, a fiery gaze, and a chip on his muscular shoulder. And despite a spat, Mara can't fight her yearning for the irresistible Highlander. Then she learns that she's inherited a Scottish castle, and the stipulations she must meet in order to keep her unexpected windfall will help her banish the hottie Scottie from her mind . . . she hopes.\n\nAs a ghost, Sir Alexander Douglas has hated the name MacDougall for ages. Once a medieval knight betrothed to a stranger, he fell victim to her beau, a MacDougall, who tricked him into a curse that he would forever haunt the bed intended for his would-be bride. Now Alexander will stop at nothing to keep the magnificent four-poster out of MacDougallÃ¢â‚¬â€or McDougallÃ¢â‚¬â€hands. But when Mara buys the bed for her castle, he reckons she's nothing like his enemy. After all, no other MacDougall ever made him burn with passion and long for the one thing he never knew he missed: love\n\n\n\nSOME LIKE IT KILTED - Book 4 by Allie MacKay\n\nA woman's heart needs a loving home-- \n\nEven if it's a little bit haunted. \n\nMindy Menlove lives in a castle that was transported stone-by-stone from Scotland.
