Offering a fairly faithful depiction of what is known of the monk's life, the film follows Dogen, handsomely portrayed by kabuki actor Nakamura Kantaro, from an orphan child inspired by his mother's dying words to a young monk wandering in China where he experiences his awakening. After reaching enlightenment, he returns to Kyoto to spread his teachings of silent meditation, attracting both dedicated followers and fierce detractors who cast him as a heretic.\n\nIn his travels and teachings, Dogen encounters many different people. Some guide him, some follow him, and some test him, but all become crucial figures in his spiritual journey of peace and meditation. Zen's supporting cast includes Kora Kengo (Snakes and Earrings) as a young monk gone astray, Uchida Yuki (Welcome to the Quiet Room) as a prostitute and aspiring nun, and Fujiwara Tatsuya (Death Note) as the shogun haunted by inner ghosts.\n\nIMDb RATING: 7.9/10 (127 votes)\n\nSource.......: DVD9 R2\nRuntime......: 128 Min\nVideo Bitrate: ~1388Kbps\nResolution...: 576 x 320\nAspect Ratio.: 1.800:1\nFrame Rate...: 23.976\nAudio Bitrate: ~128 Kbps ABR MP3\nLanguage.....: Japanese\nSubtitle.....: Japanese / English\n\ncredit CoWRY &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, xxxUniversalAbsurdityxxx, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666 &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE!!!\n\n*****help what we can with haiti or any other in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d563ba511fc6e3fc5ae71be1192510a4822eb788","amp;dn":"Zen.2009.RETAiL.DVDRip.XviD-CoWRY%28ENG+SUBS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d563ba511fc6e3fc5ae71be1192510a4822eb788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,99,186,81,31,198,227,252,90,231,27,225,25,37,16,164,130,46,183,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
