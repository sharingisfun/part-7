This introduction to computer science continually reinforces those ties by using real-world science problems as examples. Anyone who has taken a high school science class will be able to follow along as the book introduces the basics of programming, then goes on to show readers how to work with databases, download data from the web automatically, build graphical interfaces, and most importantly, how to think like a professional programmer.\n\nTopics covered include:\n\nBasic elements of programming from arithmetic to loops and if statements.\n\nUsing functions and modules to organize programs.\n\nUsing lists, sets, and dictionaries to organize data.\n\nDesigning algorithms systematically.\n\nDebugging things when they go wrong.\n\nCreating and querying databases.\n\nBuilding graphical interfaces to make programs easier to use.\n\nObject-oriented programming and programming patterns.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:221351867971ab52b446922097aedab23e04ea08","amp;dn":"Practical+Programming+-+An+Introduction+to+Computer+Science+Usin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"221351867971ab52b446922097aedab23e04ea08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,19,81,134,121,113,171,82,180,70,146,32,151,174,218,178,62,4,234,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
