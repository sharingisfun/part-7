But all of that was taken away in an instant. Now she's getting by as best she can, though sometimes that means doing things the old Nova would never do. Things that are slowly eating away at her spirit. Every day blends into the next . . . until she meets Quinton Carter. His intense, honey brown eyes instantly draw her in, and he looks just about as broken as she feels inside.\n\nQuinton once got a second chance at life-but he doesn't want it. The tattoos on his chest are a constant reminder of what he's done, what he's lost. He's sworn to never allow happiness into his life . . . but then beautiful, sweet Nova makes him smile. He knows he's too damaged to get close to her, yet she's the only one who can make him feel alive again. Quinton will have to decide: does he deserve to start over? Or should he pay for his past forever?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b1e9b475d492dc3aec802dcd0d7d3e1cb8a0bcf","amp;dn":"Jessica_Sorensen_-_Breaking_Nova__Nova__1_.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b1e9b475d492dc3aec802dcd0d7d3e1cb8a0bcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,30,155,71,93,73,45,195,174,200,2,220,208,215,211,225,203,138,11,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
