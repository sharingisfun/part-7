The earliest settled line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Ian Stewart (keyboards, piano), Mick Jagger (lead vocals, harmonica), Keith Richards (guitar, vocals), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums). Since Wyman's retirement in 1993, the band's full members have been Jagger, Richards, Watts and guitarist Ronnie Wood. Darryl Jones (bassist) and Chuck Leavell (keyboardist) are regular contributors but not full band members. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted the Rolling Stones in 1989, noting that &quot;critical acclaim and popular consensus has accorded them the title of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Greatest Rock and Roll Band.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Rolling Stone magazine ranked them 4th on their &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; list, and their album sales are estimated to have been more than 200 million worldwide.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTattoo You is the 16th British and 18th American studio album by The Rolling Stones, released in 1981.
