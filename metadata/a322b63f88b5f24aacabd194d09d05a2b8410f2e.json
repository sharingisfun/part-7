Unlike his previous books, the book outlines what Lessig considers to be the systemic corrupting influence of special-interest money on American politics, and only mentions copyright and other free culture topics briefly, as examples. He argued that the Congress in 2011 spent the first quarter debating debit-card fees while ignoring what he sees as more pressing issues, including health care reform or global warming or the deficit.Lessig has been described in The New York Times as an &quot;original and dynamic legal scholar.&quot;\n\nThis torrent exists because this book needs to be distributed.
