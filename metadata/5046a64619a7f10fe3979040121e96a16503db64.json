It offers an engaging and accessible writing style through the use of tools such as case studies and analogies to thoroughly explain difficult microbiology concepts. The newest of these features includes the Secret World of Microbes and Quick Search. We are so excited to offer a robust learning program with student-focused learning activities, allowing the student to manage their learning while you easily manage their assessment. Revised art and updated photos help concepts stand out. Detailed reports show how your assignments measure various learning objectives from the book (or input your own!), levels of BloomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Taxonomy or other categories, and how your students are doing. The Talaro Learning program will save you time while improving your students success in this course.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5046a64619a7f10fe3979040121e96a16503db64","amp;dn":"Foundations+in+Microbiology%2C+9E+-+Talaro+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5046a64619a7f10fe3979040121e96a16503db64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,70,166,70,25,167,241,15,227,151,144,64,18,30,150,161,101,3,219,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
