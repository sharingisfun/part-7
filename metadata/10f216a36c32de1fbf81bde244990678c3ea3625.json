Tobi, however, manages to survive the assault by sacrificing his left eye to use Izanagi, after which he appears behind a shocked and exhausted Konan and stabs her with a metal pipe. Noting that it was a favour to a former comrade, Tobi explains his technique to Konan. Konan refuses to give up and continues to fight Tobi. Tobi manages to subdue her and places Konan inside a genjutsu to force her to reveal the location of the Rinnegan. Tobi travels to the location and retrieves Nagato's corpse and then takes his leave. A blood-soaked piece of paper is blown off Konan's body by the wind and travels to her childhood hideout. As it travels, more of the Ame Orphans past with Jiraiya is revealed, as well as some of their time as the original Akatsuki. Meanwhile, Tobi, dressed in new attire, is told by Zetsu that they have received intel on the Nine-Tails whereabouts from Kisame Hoshigaki. With this, Tobi declares that it's time to capture the Nine-Tails. At the end of the episode, the blood-soaked paper that flew to the hideout covers Konan's frog card, signifying that she was &quot;home&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10f216a36c32de1fbf81bde244990678c3ea3625","amp;dn":"%5BM%40nI%5D+Naruto+Shippuden+-+253+-+The+Bridge+to+Peace.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10f216a36c32de1fbf81bde244990678c3ea3625","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,242,22,163,108,50,222,31,191,129,189,226,68,153,6,120,195,234,54,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
