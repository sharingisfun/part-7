Naturally, the writer's dilemma is the meatiest one--will he be noble or sell out?--and Mamet arrives at a solution that's as hilarious as it is morally justified. Along the way, the rigors of filmmaking are explored with farcical abandon, such as how to provide a high-tech product placement... in a 19th-century story. Mamet's razor-sharp dialogue is gourmet popcorn here--each kernel yields a tasty surprise--and the whole scenario (intentionally modeled in the style of Preston Sturges) plays out with the breezy assurance of vintage screwball comedy. It's pure gold from start to finish, and even the closing credits offer another reason to laugh. \n\n\nDirected by: David Mamet\n\nStarring: Laura Silverman, Charles Durning, Alec Baldwin, Clark Gregg, David Paymer, Julia Stiles, Patti Lu Pone, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rebecca Pidgeon, Ricky Jay, Sarah Jessica Parker, William H.
