Crammed into old houses and hotels, abandoned prisons and empty hospitals, the spirits that linger continue to capture our collective imagination, but why? His own fascination piqued by a house hunt in Los Angeles that revealed derelict foreclosures and â€œzombie homes,â€ Dickey embarks on a journey across the continental United States to decode and unpack the American history repressed in our most famous haunted places. Some have established reputations as â€œthe most haunted mansion in America,â€ or â€œthe most haunted prisonâ€; others, like the haunted Indian burial grounds in West Virginia, evoke memories from the past our collective nation tries to forget.\r\nWith boundless curiosity, Dickey conjures the dead by focusing on questions of the livingâ€“how do we, the living, deal with stories about ghosts, and how do we inhabit and move through spaces that have been deemed, for whatever reason, haunted? Paying attention not only to the true facts behind a ghost story, but also to the ways in which changes to those facts are madeâ€“and why those changes are madeâ€“Dickey paints a version of American history left out of the textbooks, one of things left undone, crimes left unsolved. Spellbinding, scary, and wickedly insightful, Ghostland discovers the past weâ€™re most afraid to speak of aloud in the bright light of day is the same past that tends to linger in the ghost stories we whisper in the dark.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f03c92fdc52aa5f5208b998a45c87df1d2c60fec","amp;dn":"Ghostland+-+Colin+Dickey+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f03c92fdc52aa5f5208b998a45c87df1d2c60fec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,60,146,253,197,42,165,245,32,139,153,138,69,200,125,241,210,198,15,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
