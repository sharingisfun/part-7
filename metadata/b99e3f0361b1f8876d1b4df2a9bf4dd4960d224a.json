Introducing some fresh beats within the boundaries of the electronica style, the French duo combines classy and inspirational pieces of disco sound with original and superior instrumentation. Modjo's themes are also enlightened by a refined choosing of samples, namely of Chic's &quot;Soup for One on the previously mentioned &quot;Lady (Hear Me Tonight),&quot; and of &quot;Le Freak&quot; on &quot;Chillin',&quot; another chart topper extracted from the album. Romain Tranchart and Yann Destagnol, the creative duo almost exclusively responsible for most of the album's themes, present the necessary ambience for a sound journey settling halfway on the disco floors and on the radio. If &quot;Ackowledgment,&quot; the album's opening track, delineates a plain excursion throughout electronica style inspiring glints, the following tracks clarify their purposes. &quot;No More Tears and &quot;Rollercoaster are just two of the themes sustaining their better instrumental techniques, by way of the combination between stylish beats and of a masterful handling of rhythmic guitars. Modjo ultimately certifies the French duo's composing attainments, through their elaborate and unconventional conceptions.\nAll Music Review by Mario Mesquita Borges.\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Acknowledgement\n[02] Chillin'\n[03] Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\n[04] Too Good To Be True\n[05] Peace Of Mind\n[06] What I Mean\n[07] Music Takes You Back\n[08] No More Tears\n[09] Rollercoaster\n[10] On Fire\n[11] Savior Eyes\n\nPlay Time - 00h:48m:24s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Lady (Hear Me Tonight) (Acoustic Mix)\n[02] Chillin' (Live)\n[03] Lady (Hear Me Tonight) (Choo Choo's Original Recipe)\n[04] Chillin' (B.H.Q.
