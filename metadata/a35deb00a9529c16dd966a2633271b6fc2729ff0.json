I (mafutrct) compiled and extended it with the help of others over the past 3 years. Back then, finding go books was quite hard, and it took a lot of effort to get not only the few public books but also the more extensive pile on private ftps and such. Since IÃŽâ€œÃŽâ€œÃƒÂ©Ã‚Â¼ÃŽâ€œÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ³m a totally nice person I decided to collect, sort and publish this pile for all of you.\n\nIf I didn't miscount, this is the third incarnation of Mafutrct's Go Book Collection. We're up to about 4.6 gb, from 800 and 900 mb before. As a major change, I included the Go World archive and books in other languages as well. I hope it is useful for some of you.\n\nThe heap of material waiting to be sorted and added keeps growing, so sorry, this is not everything I have right now, but you can expect me to add it next time ÃŽâ€œÃŽâ€œÃƒÂ©Ã‚Â¼ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£ probably next year. Despite this, I do encourage you to send me new material, so the torrent keeps growing and prospering for many years, being a helpful resource for all Go players that canÃŽâ€œÃŽâ€œÃƒÂ©Ã‚Â¼ÃŽâ€œÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ³t afford to buy books, or keeping books alive that are discontinued.\n\nIÃŽâ€œÃŽâ€œÃƒÂ©Ã‚Â¼ÃŽâ€œÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ³m doing this for free, obviously, and I do in no way earn any money by this, so please donÃŽâ€œÃŽâ€œÃƒÂ©Ã‚Â¼ÃŽâ€œÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ³t sue me. If you hold rights on one of the included books and you want it removed, please drop me a message. Contact details are at the end. But please notice that this is also a way of free advertisement, and as for me, I do buy books that I enjoyed to support the author. And I believe that many people do so as well. A huge deal of what I bought was acquired and tried in a legally questionably way before, and would never have been bought, nor recommended to friends, if that way did not exist.\n\nI would like to thank those who contributed material, but as I refrain from listing names you know who you are. Thanks, guys!\n\nSo, again, I hope this is useful for some of you. Seeding would be appreciated since my pipe is smallband. Have fun!\n\nmafutrct","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a35deb00a9529c16dd966a2633271b6fc2729ff0","amp;dn":"%5BGo+Igo+Baduk+Weiqi%5D+%5Bmafutrct%5D+%5B2010.08.12%5D+Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a35deb00a9529c16dd966a2633271b6fc2729ff0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,93,235,0,169,82,156,22,221,150,106,38,51,39,27,111,194,114,159,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
