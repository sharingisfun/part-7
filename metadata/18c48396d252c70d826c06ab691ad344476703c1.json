Maria Fitzgerald O'Malley (Bardot) is the daughter of an Irish political dissident who has traveled to Latin America with her father to take part in an anarchist political uprising. When her father is killed, Maria, left to her own devices, happens upon a traveling circus, where she strikes up a friendship with one of the performers, also named Maria (Moreau). Maria O'Malley joins up with the carnival, and she works up a dance routine with Maria; the act is a smash hit, especially after the Irish Maria accidentally loses part of her costume during a performance. Despite their success, the two Marias find themselves increasingly distressed with the poverty and brutality of the peasants' lives, and they soon decide to use their talents in support of revolutionary leader Flores (George Hamilton).\n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Viva Maria.1965.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 8 011 Kbps\nLength            : 6.53 GiB for 1h 56mn 37s 995ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 548 (2.336) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : DTS at 1 509 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059956/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059956/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: French mostly, with Spanish and English\nSubtitles: English\n\nMy rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18c48396d252c70d826c06ab691ad344476703c1","amp;dn":"Viva+Maria.1965.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18c48396d252c70d826c06ab691ad344476703c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,196,131,150,210,82,199,13,130,108,6,171,105,26,211,68,71,103,3,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
