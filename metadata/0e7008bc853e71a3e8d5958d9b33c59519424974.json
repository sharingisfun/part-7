The album was recorded in New York with Piazzolla and his classic New Tango Quintet, which worked with Piazzolla from 1978 to 1988 and included Fernando SuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rez Paz (violin), Pablo Ziegler (piano), Horacio Malvicino, Sr. (guitar) and HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ctor Console (bass). Tango: Zero Hour, produced by Kip Hanrahan, was originally released by American ClavÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in 1986.\n\nAstor PiazzollaÃƒÂ¢??s nuevo tango, which incorporates classical forms and jazz elements into the traditional tango, was so controversial at its advent that Piazzolla had his life threatened on numerous occasions and was even exiled from his country. The traditional tango, born out of the bordellos of Buenos Aires in the way that jazz began in New Orleans, had been haunted by its origins for decades. Piazzolla, with his innovative style and desire to legitimize the tango and bring it to a serious musical audience, changed the face of the music forever.\n\nBorn in Mar Del Plata, Argentina in 1921, Piazzolla moved to New York with his father at an early age and lived there until 1937. At age nine he was asked by the famed tango singer / composer Carlos Gardel to appear in his movie ÃƒÂ¢??El Dia Que Me Quieras.ÃƒÂ¢?? Upon his return to Buenos Aires, he learned to play the bandoneÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n, began arranging for Anibal TroiloÃƒÂ¢??s orchestra (one of the main Tango bands of the day), and studied with the composer Alberto Ginastera.\n\n1954 marked a pivotal point in PiazzollaÃƒÂ¢??s career, when he won a scholarship to study composition with the celebrated pedagogue Nadia Boulanger in Paris. It was Boulanger who encouraged Piazzolla to develop the popular music of his heritage, to make tango a serious music. In 1955 he organized his Octeto Buenos Aires, after his studies with Boulanger and an encounter with Gerry MulliganÃƒÂ¢??s Octet. It signified the beginning of what came to be known as nuevo tango.\n\nOther ensembles followed, including PiazzollaÃƒÂ¢??s first quintet which worked together from 1960 to 1970. The New Tango Quintet, convened in 1978, was in a class by itself. When Tango: Zero Hour was released, the ensemble had spent nearly 10 years together and Piazzolla was at the peak of his powers. SPIN Magazine called Tango: Zero Hour ÃƒÂ¢??extraordinaryÃƒÂ¢?? and The Village VOICE called Piazzolla ÃƒÂ¢??a modern master.ÃƒÂ¢?? Jon Pareles of The New York Times said, ÃƒÂ¢??To hear Mr. PiazzollaÃƒÂ¢??s tangos as musical marvels is beside the point. As edgy lines and long-breathed tunes defy and embrace one another, the tangos suggest that even in the modern world, romance survives.ÃƒÂ¢??\n\nThe release of Tango: Zero Hour marks the third Nonesuch release featuring Astor Piazzolla. In 1988 a recording of his Concierto para bandoneÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n and Tres tangos was released, and in 1990 he made his last recording, of a piece commissioned by the Kronos Quartet called Five Tango Sensations. (His first composition for Kronos, Four, For Tango, appears on their 1988 release Winter Was Hard.) The music of Piazzolla is also featured on two recent Nonesuch recordings by the violinist Gidon Kremer: Hommage ÃƒÆ’  Piazzolla and El Tango.\n\n\t\nTango Zero Hour\n79469\n\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e7008bc853e71a3e8d5958d9b33c59519424974","amp;dn":"Astor+Piazzolla+-+Tango+-+Zero+Hour+-+1986+-+Nonesuch.1998.flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e7008bc853e71a3e8d5958d9b33c59519424974","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,112,8,188,133,62,113,163,232,213,149,141,155,51,197,149,25,66,73,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
