DJ Scott La Rock was murdered on August 27, 1987, months after the release of BDP's debut album, Criminal Minded. The name of the group, Boogie Down, derives from a nickname for the South Bronx section of The Bronx, one of the five boroughs of New York City. The group pioneered the fusion of dancehall reggae and hip hop music and their debut LP Criminal Minded contained frank descriptions of life in the South Bronx of the late 1980s thus setting the stage for what would eventually become gangsta rap.\n\n\nWhile the origins of hip-hop are believed to be from the Bronx, rival hip-hop group Juice Crew's lyrics were misunderstood to contain a claim in the song &quot;The Bridge&quot; that hip hop was directly a result of artists originating from Queensbridge. Boogie Down and KRS retorted angrily with songs like The Bridge is Over and South Bronx, which started one of the first notable hip hop wars as MC Shan, Marley Marl, Roxanne ShantÃƒÂ© and Blaq Poet all released songs featuring verses personally attacking KRS and Scott La Rock. The Bridge Wars, however, were only short-lived and after the death of Scott La Rock prior to the group's second album, KRS began to concentrate on consciously focused music.\n\n\nCriminal Minded 1986 (Rereleased 2008)\n\nCriminal Minded by Boogie Down Productions is a highly influential[1] hip hop album. Production on the LP is credited to 'Blastmaster' KRS-One (Lawrence Krisna Parker) and DJ Scott La Rock (Scott Sterling), but in interviews it has been revealed that an uncredited Ced-Gee (Cedric Miller) of The Ultramagnetic MCs had a key role in crafting the sound of the LP - the back cover, however, carries the message &quot;a special thanks to Ced Gee&quot;.\n\n\nReleased in early 1987, the album heavily sampled records from James Brown and AC/DC and also had a dancehall reggae influence. The songs Ã¢â‚¬Å“South BronxÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Bridge is OverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ignited the rivalry with the Queens-bred emcee MC Shan and the Juice Crew .\n\nThe album is also credited with providing a prototype for East Coast gangsta rap. For instance, the cover, which showcases Parker and Sterling surrounded by an arsenal of weapons, was hip-hopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first major release to feature members brandishing firearms. The album also contained several seminal hardcore songs such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“9mm Goes Bang,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ one of the first hip-hop songs to be based around a first-person crime narrative, and &quot;P Is Free,&quot; which details an encounter with a drug-abusing prostitute.\n\nDisc 1 \n\n1\t&quot;Poetry&quot;\n2\t&quot;South Bronx&quot;\n3\t&quot;9mm Goes Bang&quot;\n4\t&quot;Word From Our Sponsor&quot;\n5\t&quot;Elementary&quot;\n6\t&quot;Dope Beat&quot;\n7\t&quot;Remix For P Is Free&quot;\n8\t&quot;The Bridge Is Over&quot;\n9\t&quot;Super-Hoe&quot;\n10\t&quot;Criminal Minded&quot;\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n01.
