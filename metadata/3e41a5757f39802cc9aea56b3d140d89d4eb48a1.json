Inside Volatility Arbitrage can help them do this. Author and financial expert Alireza Javaheri uses the classic approach to evaluating volatility -- time series and financial econometrics -- in a way that he believes is superior to methods presently used by market participants. He also suggests that there may be &quot;skewness&quot; trading opportunities that can be used to trade the markets more profitably. Filled with in-depth insight and expert advice, Inside Volatility Arbitrage will help traders discover when &quot;skewness&quot; may present valuable trading opportunities as well as why it can be so profitable.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIllustrations.\nAcknowledgments.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nSummary.\n\nContributions and Further Research.\n\nData and Programs.\n\nChapter 1: The Volatility Problem.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThe Stock Market.\n\nThe Stock Price Process.\n\nHistoric Volatility.\n\nThe Derivatives Market.\n\nThe Black-Scholes Approach.\n\nThe Cox-Ross-Rubinstein Approach.\n\nJump Diffusion and Level-Dependent Volatility.\n\nJump Diffusion.\n\nLevel-Dependent Volatility.\n\nLocal Volatility.\n\nThe Dupire Approach.\n\nThe Derman-Kani Approach.\n\nStability Issues.\n\nCalibration Frequency.\n\nStochastic Volatility.\n\nStochastic Volatility Processes.\n\nGARCH and Diffusion Limits.\n\nThe Pricing PDE Under Stochastic Volatility.\n\nThe Market Price of Volatility Risk.\n\nThe Two-Factor PDE.\n\nThe Generalized Fourier Transform.\n\nThe Transform Technique.\n\nSpecial Cases.\n\nThe Mixing Solution.\n\nThe Romano-Touzi Approach.\n\nA One-Factor Monte Carlo Technique.\n\nThe Long-Term Asymptotic Case.\n\nThe Deterministic Case.\n\nThe Stochastic Case.\n\nA Series Expansion on Volatility-of-Volatility.\n\nPure-Jump Models.\n\nVariance Gamma.\n\nVariance Gamma with Stochastic Arrival.\n\nVariance Gamma with Gamma Arrival Rate.\n\nChapter 2: The Inference Problem.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nUsing Option Prices.\n\nDirection Set (Powell) Method.\n\nNumeric Tests.\n\nThe Distribution of the Errors.\n\nUsing Stock Prices.\n\nThe Likelihood Function.\n\nFiltering.\n\nThe Simple and Extended Kalman Filters.\n\nThe Unscented Kalman Filter.\n\nKushnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nonlinear Filter.\n\nParameter Learning.\n\nParameter Estimation via MLE.\n\nDiagnostics.\n\nParticle Filtering.\n\nComparing Heston with Other Models.\n\nThe Performance of the Inference Tools.\n\nThe Bayesian Approach.\n\nUsing the Characteristic Function.\n\nIntroducing Jumps.\n\nPure Jump Models.\n\nRecapitulation.\n\nModel Identification.\n\nConvergence Issues and Solutions.\n\nChapter 3: The Consistency Problem.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThe Consistency Test.\n\nThe Setting.\n\nThe Cross-Sectional Results.\n\nRobustness Issues for the Cross-Sectional Method.\n\nTime-Series Results.\n\nFinancial Interpretation.\n\nThe Peso Theory.\n\nBackground.\n\nNumeric Results.\n\nTrading Strategies.\n\nSkewness Trades.\n\nKurtosis Trades.\n\nDirectional Risks.\n\nAn Exact Replication.\n\nThe Mirror Trades.\n\nAn Example of the Skewness Trade.\n\nMultiple Trades.\n\nHigh Volatility-of-Volatility and High Correlation.\n\nNon-Gaussian Case.\n\nVGSA.\n\nAWord of Caution.\n\nForeign Exchange, Fixed Income, and Other Markets.\n\nForeign Exchange.\n\nFixed Income.\n\nReferences.\n\nIndex.\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nALIREZA JAVAHERI, PhD, CFA, is an adjunct researcher in the Finance and Economics Department of Ecole des Mines de Paris.
