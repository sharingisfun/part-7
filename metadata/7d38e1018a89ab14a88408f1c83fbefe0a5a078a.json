Ward's # 1 New York Times bestselling Black Dagger Brotherhood continues as a royal bloodline is compromised by a grave threat to the throne.\n\nLong live the KingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nAfter turning his back on the throne for centuries, Wrath, son of Wrath, finally assumed his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mantle--with the help of his beloved mate. But the crown sets heavily on his head. As the war with the Lessening Society rages on, and the threat from the Band of Bastards truly hits home, he is forced to make choices that put everything--and everyone--at risk.\n\nBeth Randall thought she knew what she was getting into when she mated the last pure blooded vampire on the planet: An easy ride was not it. But when she decides she wants a child, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unprepared for WrathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s response--or the distance it creates between them.\n\nThe question is, will true love win out... or tortured legacy take over?\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR \n\nJessica Rowley Pell Bird was born on 1969 in Massachusetts, USA. She is the daughter of Maxine F. and W. Gillette Bird, Jr. She began writing as a child, penning her thoughts in diaries as well as inventing short stories. She read her first Harlequin Presents novel in a rose garden when she was in her teens. She was hooked immediately. By the time she went to college, she had boxes and boxes of Harlequins and Silhouettes. Every year, her mother would ask why all those books had to live in the house and Jess would reply that if even one of them disappeared she would know","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d38e1018a89ab14a88408f1c83fbefe0a5a078a","amp;dn":"THE+KING+-+A+NOVEL+OF+THE+BLACK+DAGGER+BROTHERHOOD%7CEPUB%7C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d38e1018a89ab14a88408f1c83fbefe0a5a078a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,56,225,1,138,137,171,20,168,132,8,241,200,63,190,254,10,90,7,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
