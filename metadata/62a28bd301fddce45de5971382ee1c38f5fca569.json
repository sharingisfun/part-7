This new edition of the handbook, perhaps better known as the 'Orange book', provides guidance on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric examination and interviewing of adults and children - not just a central skill, but the basis for reaching a diagnosis and defining a treatment plan. It also covers special interview situations, such as dealing with specific patient reactions, and other special problems, for example, conducting a complicated assessment in cases of autism or self harm. The final chapters explain when to refer to the experts and describes early treatment interventions. The book concludes with important legal and service organisation issues. \n\nHigh Quality PDF.
