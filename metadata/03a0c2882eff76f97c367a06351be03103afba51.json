ILOG CPLEX's mathematical  \noptimization technology enables better\ndecision-making for efficient resource utilization.\nWith ILOG CPLEX, complex business problems can be  \nrepresented as mathematical programming models. \nAdvanced optimization algorithms allow you to\nrapidly find solutions to these models.  \n \nToday, over 1,300 corporations and government\nagencies use ILOG CPLEX, along with researchers at \nover 1,000 universities. ILOG CPLEX helps solve \nplanning and scheduling problems in virtually every\nindustry. More than 100 of the world's leading  \nsoftware companies are also ILOG CPLEX customers,  \nincluding market leaders like SAP, Oracle and Sabre.\n \nRobust algorithms for demanding problems \nILOG pioneered the development of the algorithms\nneeded to solve today's most demanding mathematical\noptimization problems. ILOG CPLEX has solved\nproblems with millions of constraints and variables,\nand consistently sets new standards for mathematical\nprogramming software speed and reliability. \n \nIndustry-leading support\nNo other vendor can match ILOG's rate of product\nimprovement or support resources. ILOG is committed\nto ongoing innovation in the field of optimization,\nprotecting your ILOG CPLEX investment well into the\nfuture.  \n \nFEATURES:\n \nHigh performance\nILOG CPLEX optimizers deliver the power to solve\nlarge-scale, real-world optimization problems, the \nreliability necessary for mission-critical decision\nmaking, and the speed required in today's\ninteractive applications. It's not just mathematical\nexcellence that drives ILOG CPLEX performance.  \nSuperior software engineering manages the complexity\nunderlying the leading-edge search processes. And  \nthe ability to use multiple CPUs and cores to\nautomatically divide the work at hand-ILOG Parallel\nCPLEX-is available on shared-memory systems under  \nthe standard ILOG CPLEX license.  \n \nFundamental algorithms \nILOG CPLEX comes with the fastest, most reliable\nimplementations of the fundamental algorithms used \nfor solving demanding mathematical optimization \nproblems. ILOG CPLEX provides flexible,  \nhigh-performance optimizers used when solving linear\nprogramming, quadratic programming, quadratically  \nconstrained programming and mixed integer\nprogramming problems.  \n \nRobust and reliable \nA large installed base helps us make ILOG CPLEX \nbetter with each release. Every new feature is  \ntested on the biggest, most diverse model library in\nthe world.\n \nFlexible interfaces \nILOG CPLEX gives developers a variety of ways to\ninteract with it during the development and \ndeployment of their applications. Whether you use  \nprogramming interfaces like C, C++, .NET, Java and \nPythonr, or one of the modeling systems: ILOG OPL  \nDevelopment Studio, AIMMS, AMPL, GAMS, MPL and  \nMicrosoft Solver Foundation, or key software\nproducts Microsoft Excelr and MATLABr, you will find\na familiar working environment in which to leverage\nyour investment. Moreover, ILOG CPLEX can be used on\na wide variety of hardware and operating systems for\ntrue portability.\n \n \nAMPL is a comprehensive and powerful algebraic  \nmodeling language for linear and nonlinear  \noptimization problems, with either discrete or  \ncontinuous variables. ILOG is an authorized original\nequipment manufacturer (OEM) of AMPL, which was \noriginally developed at Bell Laboratories, the  \nresearch and development arm of Lucent Technologies.\nILOG offers AMPL in two ways: \n1. ILOG AMPL bundled with ILOG CPLEX, which limits \naccessibility of ILOG CPLEX to the AMPL modeling\nlanguage \n2. ILOG AMPL, as an optional add-on when purchasing\ndevelopment and deployment licenses of ILOG CPLEX  \n \nAMPL is based upon modern modeling principles and  \nutilizes an advanced architecture, providing\nflexibility most other modeling systems lack.\nSuccessfully used in demanding mathematical \nprogramming modeling applications around the world,\nAMPL is available on all platforms on which ILOG\nCPLEX runs.  \n \nAMPL allows modelers to create models with maximum \nproductivity. By using AMPL's natural algebraic \nnotation, even a very large, complex model can often\nbe stated in a concise (often less than one page), \nunderstandable form. Since AMPL models are easy to \nunderstand, debug and modify, AMPL also makes\nmaintaining models easy.\n \nBenefits:\n* Allows users to express models concisely in\n familiar, flexible algebraic notation: \n* Using indexing and sets, whole classes of \n constraints or objective terms can be described in\n relatively few generalized model statements\n* Supports a wide variety of natural algebraic  \n expressions\n* Allows separation of model and data\n* Highly flexible-for example, does not impose any \n particular data or model entry order\n* May be used in interactive or batch environments \n* Allows models to be easily modified and\n maintained:\n* Sets, variables and constraints can be readily\n added, changed or deleted\n* Separate data files can be readily updated, or\n imported from outside data sources \n* External databases can be easily connected into  \n AMPL tables\n* Offers ODBC database support on Microsoft Windows\n platforms  \n* Minimizes modeling errors with extensive error\n checking:  \n* Checks model syntax and consistency\n* Closely checks validity of subscripts  \n* Covers most optimization model types:  \n* Linear programming problems \n* Network problems  \n* Mixed integer programming problems \n* Quadratic programming problems  \n* General nonlinear programming problems \n* Provides powerful, flexible display options:  \n* Permits interactive data and solution browsing\n* Allows the creation of customized solution\n reporting  \n \nSupport for AMPL.\nILOG provides support and maintenance services for \nAMPL when AMPL is used in conjunction with any ILOG\nCPLEX product. While AMPL can be used with other\nsolvers, ILOG does not provide support for such usage. \n\n\n \nÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“\n  ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸\nÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸\n  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“\n  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â² ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸\nÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â² ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸\nÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸  ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â² ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸\n  ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“COMMENTSÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸\n  Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â²\n  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“\n  ÃƒÅ“ Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸  ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â² ÃƒÅ“\nÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ“\n  ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ“\n ÃƒÅ“Do NOT distribute this release outside of the sceneÃƒÅ“\nÃƒÅ“Keep the scene alive and secure!ÃƒÅ“\n  ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ“\n  All good progs start as freeware,\n then things get worse ... ;-)\n\n ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸\nÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸\n ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸\n ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸\n ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸\n  ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â² Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸\n  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“\nÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“\n  ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ“\n\n\n ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“\n ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“\nÃ‚Â²Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ INSTALLATION NOTES ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â²\n  Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²\n ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â² Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸\n  Ã‚Â² ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ Ã‚Â²\nÃ‚Â²  ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸  Ã‚Â²\nÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“\nÃ‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â²  Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â²\nÃ‚Â²Ã‚Â² ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â²\nÃ‚Â²Ã‚Â²`TLB' Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â²\n  Try it, Like it, Buy it!  \n\n \n  \n \n \n1.
