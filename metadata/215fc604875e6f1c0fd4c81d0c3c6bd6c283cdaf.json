Early on, Peacock's spacey, harmonically drifting pieces were regularly interpreted by her second husband, the jazz pianist Paul Bley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but she's since been covered by everyone from Busta Rhymes to Pat Metheny and Marilyn Crispell. Peacock has finally reacquired I'm The One's rights from Sony-BMG, and reissued this long-unavailable classic. And for all the familiarity of computer-assisted vocals now, nothing prepares you for the howl of her searingly high notes spiralling up out of spooky organ chords and soul-brass riffs on the title track, or against the rolling blues groove of Pony, or the dark and prowling one of Blood. Elvis's Love Me Tender is the only cover, a blend of soft, lyrical intimacy and fierce exhortation. The underpinnings are as 1970s soul/blues-rooted as any classic-pop listener could wish, but the uncompromising, sound-manipulating focus still sounds contemporary.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:215fc604875e6f1c0fd4c81d0c3c6bd6c283cdaf","amp;dn":"Annette+Peacock+-+I%27m+The+One+%5B1972%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"215fc604875e6f1c0fd4c81d0c3c6bd6c283cdaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,95,198,4,135,94,111,28,15,212,200,29,12,60,107,214,194,131,205,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
