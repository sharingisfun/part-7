Over 4GB of free space is required to download it, so make sure that ample spare memory is available before attempting to do so.\r\n\r\n[Read before playing]\r\nDepending on the terrain and timing of the action, the buggy, submarines, airships, and other modes of transportation may cease to move when the player embarks or disembarks. Currently, the only fix is to restart the game from a data file saved before the bug occurred. We recommend saving frequently and/or utilizing multiple save files. This bug occurs most often when players embark or disembark while extremely close to the terrain, as well as during time-sensitive activities for events.\r\nPlease note that the game will not save automatically when escaping from a battle on the world map, even if the Auto Save function is set to the ON setting.\r\n\r\n[Applicable devices]\r\nCheck the URL below to see which devices are optimal for gameplay.
