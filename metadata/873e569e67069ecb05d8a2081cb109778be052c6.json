His characters are the men and women-both white and Indian- who made history at the battle of Adobe Walls. In 1874, Texas frontiersmen are hunting buffalo and driving the Comanche and Kiowa from their land. Finally, armed for war, the Indians head for the white man's trading post. Unflinching yet touching, both brutal and heartbreaking, Blood Red River is western writing at its very best","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:873e569e67069ecb05d8a2081cb109778be052c6","amp;dn":"Walter+Lucas-Blood+Red+River","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"873e569e67069ecb05d8a2081cb109778be052c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,62,86,158,103,6,158,203,5,216,162,8,28,177,9,119,139,224,82,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
