Three million out of its eight million population saw it in 1972, when it was released. It tells the story of peasant resistance to the oppressive rule of the Ottoman Turks in the 17th century. The story concerns a goatherder and his family. Early on, the goatherder takes his flocks into the hills. On his returns, he discovers that his wife has been raped and killed by Turks while his young daughter watched. He burns their house and takes his daughter to a shack in the hills. As she grows up, he trains her like a man and imparts her with the secrets of fighting with a staff. Once trained, they begin a systematic quest for vengeance.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Kozijat rog.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 983 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 35mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 438 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 35mn\n      Bit rate : 1 300 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 336 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.095\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.220\n      Stream size : 889 MiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 35mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 87.5 MiB (9%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 504 ms\n\nIMDB: tt0068814\n\nBulgarian audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese srt, multilanguage subpack (English, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Bulgarian)\n\nPosted at KG by janatas\n\nMetodi Andonov - Kozijat rog [1972]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16e56ab84a4b4cb5d746e4c9a2cd60d99b6c47f1","amp;dn":"Metodi+Andonov+-+Kozijat+rog+%5B1972%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16e56ab84a4b4cb5d746e4c9a2cd60d99b6c47f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,229,106,184,74,75,76,181,215,70,228,201,162,205,96,217,155,108,71,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
