The four youths do not fit in with the other children of the monastic community to which Niko brings them, and are put together in a separate cottage, called Discipline. Here they each learn of their hidden talents; Sandry with thread, Tris with weather, Daja with fire and metal, and Briar with plants. They live with two mages: Lark, a gentle woman especially attentive to Sandry since she also has thread magic, and Rosethorn, a sharp woman who shares Briar's ability with plants. Also teaching and guiding them is Niko, technically Tris's teacher, but available to all four. Daja is mentored and guided by Dedicate Initiate Frostpine, a smith mage. Their teachers, with the exception of Niko, are also ambient mages. At first it seems that a merchant, a street rat, a noblewoman, and a Trader (a trading race that is often hated by others) will never get along, but an extraordinary circumstance brings them together. They are all powerful individually, but they discover that together they are even stronger. Through an earthquake, they realize their full potential and are bound closely together forever. As children skilled in an uncommon magic, they struggle to earn the respect of the adults they encounter.\n\nMore iNFO:\n----------\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=107&amp;pid=4159#pid4159&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=107&amp;pid=4159#pid4159&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWhere to get pirated material, online and Physically.\n-----------------------------------------------------\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=416&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=416&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\n\nHow to become Trusted/VIP in The Pirate Bay By Admin\n----------------------------------------------------\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=716&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=716&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMISCELLANEOUS SCENE INFO by Alien\n--------------------------------- \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=651&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=651&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nHow to create and upload a torrent using uTorrent and Vuze by  Xern0n and datsn1pah\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=507&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=507&lt;/a&gt;\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=319&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=319&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nReferral link for unregistered users:\n-------------------------------------\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=register&amp;referrer=74&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=register&amp;referrer=74&lt;/a&gt; \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50caea5865582bcfbf837e294638120ae2151313","amp;dn":"Circle+of+Magic+-+Circle+Opens+%5BTamora+Pierce%5D%5BPdf%2C+epub+and+mob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50caea5865582bcfbf837e294638120ae2151313","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,202,234,88,101,88,43,207,191,131,126,41,70,56,18,10,226,21,19,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
