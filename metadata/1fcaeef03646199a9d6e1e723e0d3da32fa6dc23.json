An extraordinarily accomplished keyboardist, whether on piano, Rhodes, Wurlitzer or Farfisa, Diane has been compared to fellow singer-songwriters Laura Nyro and Carole King, as well as Elton John and Jerry Lee Lewis. Rolling Stone calls her &quot;Amy Winehouse-style retro pop, minus dysfunctionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Her welterweight voice is strong and fetching.&quot; The Huffington Post's David Wild said: &quot;I've just heard the future of singer-songwriters and her name is Diane Birch. Bible Belt is more than welcomingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ it's downright thrilling.&quot;\n\n&quot;Diane has one of the best new female voices I've heard in quite a while,&quot; said Daryl about the latest new artist to appear on Live From Daryl's House. &quot;She's also a very evocative songwriter and kills on the Wurlitzer. We really had a blast.&quot;\n\nDiane and Daryl tackle a seven-song set that includes a pair of fairly deep Daryl Hall and John Oates album tracks in &quot;Life's Too Short,&quot; from the 2003 album Do It For Love, while &quot;Fall in Philadelphia&quot; originally from the 1972 Atlantic debut, Whole Oates, and now available remastered on the 74 song box set DO WHAT YOU WANT BE WHAT YOU ARE, THE MUSIC OF DARYL HALL &amp; JOHN OATES(RCA/LEGACY), which streets on October 13th . The two also perform four songs from Bible Belt, including &quot;Fire Escape,&quot; &quot;Fools,&quot; &quot;Nothin' But a Miracle&quot; and &quot;Don't Wait Up.&quot; Birch shows off her vocal range on her and Daryl's soulful cover of Aretha Franklin's &quot;Daydreamin'.&quot;\n\n&quot;I had to keep pinching myself, especially when Daryl started singing 'Fire Escape,'&quot; Diane enthuses about the experience. &quot;It was a seriously surreal day and his whole crew could not have been cooler!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fcaeef03646199a9d6e1e723e0d3da32fa6dc23","amp;dn":"Daryl.Hall.Live.from.Daryl%5C%27s.House.E24.Diane.Birch.WebRip-PSo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fcaeef03646199a9d6e1e723e0d3da32fa6dc23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,202,238,240,54,70,25,154,157,110,30,114,62,13,61,163,47,166,220,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
