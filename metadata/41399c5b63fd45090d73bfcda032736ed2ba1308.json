Mixed languages with English hard subs. by French director Jan Kounen \n  &quot;This documentary film will be the testimony of a personal and subjective adventure. It will also show the dangers and risks involved in Shamanism: (1) losing yourself in the light or the darkness of your recently awakened emotions or (2) misinterpreting the feelings or visions. This could lead to schizophrenia in the event these journeys not be guided by competent Shamans or compliant with an unyielding discipline and strict diet.\n\nThe film will primarily show the therapeutic power of the Shamans and their plants. This power is a type of ancestral psychoanalysis or human psychotherapy backed by 4,000 years of experience and practice.\nThe film will allow the Shamans to speak for themselves. It will show how their cultures and their belief systems culminate from their knowledge of the Invisible.\nCGI sequences will reproduce the power of the recurring visions and the unfolding of the poetic story I witnessed. We will also convey the humor and terror I felt while experiencing these visions. The film will include investigative interviews with therapists, ethnologists and specialists in molecular brain chemistry. In the interest of understanding the invisible interaction between a Shaman and a &quot;novice,&quot; we will record the brain-wave interaction between Questembetsa and myself during a ceremony this spring. This will enable us to identify them and study their meaning.\nFinally, the December 1999 interviews, with Western individuals in therapy, will be repeated. Over a year later, we will compare the results of these two sets of interviews.\nMy personal experience will be told on the parallel of selective testimony, somewhere between Western science and Indian therapy.\n\nOnly recently has Western culture reluctantly come to recognize that Tibetan Buddhism has garnered knowledge of the spirit. The objective of this documentary is to impress upon viewers that these little-known Indians developed veritable cognitive technology through their own sciences of the spirit, thousands of years ago. To me, these men are warriors in the battle to unlock the mysteries of consciousness. Shamans consider the greatest ally and the worst enemy of every individual to be one and the sameÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦ himself or herself. In conclusion, I personally guarantee this film will not turn out to be a new age Sermon on these Indians and their culture.
