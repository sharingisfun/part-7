Not just what is the big mystery, but why is there any mystery at all? And what if there isnâ€™t? What if the Mysterium Tremendum is just an internal belief without any external counterpart? What if the answers to lifeâ€™s biggest questions were all hidden in plain sight?\r\n\r\nâ€œIf man will strike, strike through the mask!\r\nHow can the prisoner reach outside except\r\nby thrusting through the wall?â€\r\nHerman Melville\r\n\r\nThose interested in striking through the mask will welcome a theory of everything that makes sense, doesnâ€™t rely on religious or scientific chicanery, and can be easily understood. And those familiar with Jed McKenna and the Enlightenment Trilogy will know that itâ€™s not just a theory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f38260c405862294e4e664c244c07892c1871f8","amp;dn":"Jed+McKenna%27s+-+Theory+Of+Everything","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f38260c405862294e4e664c244c07892c1871f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,56,38,12,64,88,98,41,78,78,102,76,36,76,7,137,44,24,113,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
