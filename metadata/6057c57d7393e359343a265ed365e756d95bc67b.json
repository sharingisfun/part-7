Sketches, songs, and stories from Garrison and the regular cast cover the gamut of all that goes into and comes out of motherhood.\n\nMotherhood is a popular topic on A Prairie Home Companion, and not just on MotherÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s Day. ItÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s about time someone gathered the best bits into an homage to Mom. This funny, affectionate, poignant collection honors the woman who gave up her own sense of self-worth for a life of mindless drudgery, day in and day out, all for you. The woman who sticks around when everyone else in your life turns away. Who insists ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£DonÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“t worry about me, IÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“m fine. All I need is to know that youÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“re happy.ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ Who doesn't leave messages because motherhood is not about messages, itÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s about love. Share it with your mom or give it to a mom you know. If youÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“re a mom yourself, hand it to your child and say ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Listen.ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ ItÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s the least he or she can do.\n\nOverview\nCollected from live radio broadcasts of A Prairie Home Companion, these humorous and heart-warming stories and songs celebrate the ups and downs of motherhood.
