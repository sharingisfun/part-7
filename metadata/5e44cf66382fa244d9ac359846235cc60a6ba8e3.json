Convinced that great trading was a skill that could be taught to anyone, he made a bet with his partner and ran a classified ad in the Wall Street Journal looking for novices to train. His recruits, later known as the Turtles, had anything but traditional Wall Street backgrounds; they included a professional blackjack player, a pianist, and a fantasy game designer. By the time the experiment ended, Dennis had made a hundred million dollars from his Turtles and created one killer Wall Street legend.\n\nIn The Complete TurtleTrader, Michael W. Covel tells their riveting story with the first ever on-the-record interviews with individual Turtles. He shows how Dennis's rules workedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and can still work todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for any investor with the desire and commitment to learn from one of the greatest investing stories of all time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e44cf66382fa244d9ac359846235cc60a6ba8e3","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Turtle+Trader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e44cf66382fa244d9ac359846235cc60a6ba8e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,68,207,102,56,47,162,68,217,172,53,152,70,35,92,198,10,107,168,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
