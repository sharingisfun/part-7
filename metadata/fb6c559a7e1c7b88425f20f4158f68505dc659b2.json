Thickheaded, brash, and overzealous, ZIM has been banished into food service for wrecking the IRKEN home planet. He begs the ALMIGHTY TALLEST for a second chance to reclaim his lost honor. Seeing the opportunity to rid themselves of this nuisance forever, they send ZIM on a &quot;secret&quot; mission to a planet far away on the edge of the universe--Earth. Now Earth's only hope rests with a young UFO-hunting Paranormal enthusiast named Dib. Seeing through ZIM's human disguise, Dib makes it his sole mission to defend our planet from this fiendish alien menace. CONTAINS THE COMPLETE TV SERIES!!! \n\nEvery episode ever made of Invader Zim, plus the Christmas special, and all the special features. I couldn't get the commentary, or the subtitles, but all the episodes are there, and the other special features. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb6c559a7e1c7b88425f20f4158f68505dc659b2","amp;dn":"Invader+Zim+The+Complete+Invasion+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb6c559a7e1c7b88425f20f4158f68505dc659b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,108,85,154,126,28,123,136,66,95,32,244,21,143,104,80,93,198,89,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
