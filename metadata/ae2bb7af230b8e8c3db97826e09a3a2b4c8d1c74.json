IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m talking about the Robert Rodriguez- and Quentin Tarantino-helmed Grindhouse. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever seen a picture that was so monetarily unsuccessful be so immediately influential. Whereas the duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film as if had been almost directly stripped from the 1970Ã¢â‚¬Â²s (if it werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t for the contemporary talent in front of the camera, it would really be hard to tell) and put through manhandled hell, many other current pictures are more akin to recorded cassette tapes of Grindhouse. \n\nBring Me the Head of the Machine Gun Woman utilizes that same visual homage to exploitation pictures and applies them to a Grand Theft Auto-inspired story structure  about a young DJ in a Chilean dance club forced to find one of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most notoriously accomplished hit-men[woman/persons]. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a mixed tape of low budget Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s filmmaking with the appeal of modern day video game violence and setup, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about as much of a mixed tape of success.\n\nIn director Ernesto Diaz EspinozaÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs fourth feature film (and first one to not star the martial arts talents of Marko Zaror), he takes an interesting approach to have his more able character be the objective of the protagonist instead of the actual protagonist. Santiago is the DJ for a nightclub of one of the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most dangerous criminals (named Che Sausage), and he just so happens to end up going into the restroom at the most non-opportunistic moment, as Sausage and two of his other criminal cohorts follow behind to spill the beans (no gross pun intended) to each other about needing to kill Machine Gun Woman. I guess they figured having this conversation in the menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s room would mean she wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be able to hear them if she was nearby. Or maybe they just donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give a damn who hears them.\n\nUnfortunately for Santiago, he does hear them talking, and they do find out he hears them, and he isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t as good at defending himself as someone in his predicament should be. He is a convincing enough liar though (or a pathetically timid enough individual), that the kingpin gives him the opportunity to find Machine Gun Woman instead of shooting him on the spot. Good thing for Santiago he plays a lot of video games, so he knows precisely what to do.\n\nThe film is almost exactly like watching someone else play GTA, and is probably about as fun as that turns out to be. Everything from the character introduction fonts (and bounty value of each person accompanying their name) to the third person view of the vehicles as they drive is an obvious, and deliberate, attempt to make you feel like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re watching Grand Theft Auto on the big screen. In that sense, the film succeeds, and I can imagine it would play phenomenally well for a hyper-violent video game audience. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s direct, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hold back, and it has only about a seventy-minute running time. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too short to be complacent about it being not very exciting, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also too derivative of too many other movies that have come before it since RodriguezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s El Mariachi and adding only the Grand Theft Auto aspect to the mix; and that aspect loses its appeal after the third proposed Ã¢â‚¬Å“missionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for Santiago.\n\nBring Me the Head of the Machine Gun Woman is better as a concept than a finished product. There are some really fun elements to it, and the fact that it exists in the same universe as one of EspinozaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other pictures lends itself to the promise of it playing into something much bigger, and potentially more entertaining. Its title character is someone I would enjoy seeing in another film that gives her more room to do what she does; however, this film feels too much like a serviceable distraction of something to watch if your fingers hurt from stealing too many virtual vehicles for too long. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely better than stealing actual vehicles, though.\n\nThe Upside: Super fast runtime, good title character to work with for future projects, and the fact that it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ever abandon its visual themes will work well with the right niche audience.\n\nThe Downside: Too slight of a movie to feel the need to revisit and, if you are not on board with the Grand Theft Auto element ,it will start to feel tiresome.\n\nOn the Side: There is a referential cameo by one of Marko ZarorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prior heroes that director Diaz Espinoza plan to play with in another project with Machine Gun Woman. The promise of that is worth this less than desirable introductory picture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae2bb7af230b8e8c3db97826e09a3a2b4c8d1c74","amp;dn":"Tr%26aacute%3Biganme+la+cabeza+de+la+mujer+metralleta+AKA+Bring+Me+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae2bb7af230b8e8c3db97826e09a3a2b4c8d1c74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,43,183,175,35,11,142,140,61,185,120,38,224,154,58,43,76,141,28,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
