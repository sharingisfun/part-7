The supporting cast may be new but the sounds remain the same: he's still enamored of the heavy metal, glam, and psychedelia that have formed his signature since the glory days of Stone Temple Pilots. With such a familiar palette, details matter and the aptly titled Blaster lacks in subtlety. Much of it churns at crackling digital overdrive, sounding brutal, loud, and ugly, but beneath that gnarled surface Weiland can still deliver the kind of candied hooks that keep him firmly situated as a guilty pleasure. Usually, these hooks grab hold on the lightest songs: the snaky sway of &quot;Way She Moves,&quot; the icy new romanticism of &quot;Youth Quake,&quot; and, especially, &quot;Beach Pop,&quot; a piece of sticky AM bubblegum pop that earns its handclaps. These, along with the sweetly sun-kissed country-rock closer &quot;Circles,&quot; are all the more appealing because they're surrounded by heavy rockers so big-footed they often stumble upon themselves. So, a mixed bag: good enough to satisfy and also to wish the whole thing was slightly better.\n\nGenre................: Hard-Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Lossless Audiochecker, Cue\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.Modzilla\n02.Way She Moves\n03.Hotel Rio\n04.Amethyst\n05.White Lightning\n06.Blue Eyes\n07.Bleed Out\n08.Youth Quake\n09.Beach Pop\n10.Parachute\n11.20th Century Boy\n12.Circles\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89edabd7efc5439791f80cdfcb59ebc2b3c36de3","amp;dn":"Scott+Weiland+And+The+Wildabouts+-+Blaster+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89edabd7efc5439791f80cdfcb59ebc2b3c36de3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,237,171,215,239,197,67,151,145,248,12,223,203,89,235,194,179,195,109,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
