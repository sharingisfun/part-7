All eyes are on the Toffees' Ã‚Â£28m summer signing Romelu Lukaku, who was allowed to leave Chelsea after a successful season on loan at Goodison Park. The Blues themselves spent Ã‚Â£32m on Brazilian-born Spain international Diego Costa, so it will be fascinating to see which of the two strikers comes out on top. The day's first kick-off sees newly promoted Burnley host Manchester United, while Stoke boss Mark Hughes faces his former side when the Potters take on reigning champions Manchester City. Elsewhere, Aston Villa meet Hull, Newcastle host Crystal Palace, QPR take on Sunderland, Swansea face West Brom and West Ham play Southampton.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d181a6e06420e486845e5db511049a0c7f70ca9a","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+-+30th+August+2014+-+HDTV+X264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d181a6e06420e486845e5db511049a0c7f70ca9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,129,166,224,100,32,228,134,132,94,93,181,17,4,154,12,127,112,202,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
