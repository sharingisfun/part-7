Leading humanity was the powerful Remillard family, but somebody--or something--known only as &quot;Fury&quot; wanted them out of the way.\nOnly Rogi Remillard, the chosen tool of the most powerful alien being in the Milieu, and his nephew Marc, the greatest metapsychic yet born on Earth, knew about Fury. But even they were powerless to stop it when it began to kill off Remillards and other metapsychic operants--and all the suspects were Remillards themselves.\nMeanwhile, a Remillard son was born, a boy who could represent the future of all humanity. His incredible mind was more powerful even than his brother Marc's--but he was destined to be desroyed by his own DNA...unless Fury got to him first! - Goodreads Summary of Jack the Bodiless (Galactic Milieu Trilogy #1)\n\nNote: Kind of like Star Wars, but not really.
