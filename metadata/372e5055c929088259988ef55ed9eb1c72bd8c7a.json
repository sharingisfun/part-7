In FOLKS, THIS AIN'T NORMAL, he discusses how far removed we are from the simple, sustainable joy that comes from living close to the land and the people we love. Salatin has many thoughts on what normal is and shares practical and philosophical ideas for changing our lives in small ways that have big impact.\n\nSalatin, hailed by the New York Times as &quot;Virginia's most multifaceted agrarian since Thomas Jefferson [and] the high priest of the pasture&quot; and profiled in the Academy Award nominated documentary Food, Inc. and the bestselling book The Omnivore's Dilemma, understands what food should be: Wholesome, seasonal, raised naturally, procured locally, prepared lovingly, and eaten with a profound reverence for the circle of life. And his message doesn't stop there. From child-rearing, to creating quality family time, to respecting the environment, Salatin writes with a wicked sense of humor and true storyteller's knack for the revealing anecdote.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0892968206&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0892968206&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:372e5055c929088259988ef55ed9eb1c72bd8c7a","amp;dn":"Folks%2C+This+Ain%27t+Normal+Joel+Salatin+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"372e5055c929088259988ef55ed9eb1c72bd8c7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,46,80,85,201,41,8,130,89,152,142,245,94,217,235,28,114,189,140,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
