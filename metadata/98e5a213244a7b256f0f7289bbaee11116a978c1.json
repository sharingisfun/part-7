Moral behavior does not begin and end with religion but is in fact a product of evolution.\nFor many years, de Waal has observed chimpanzees soothe distressed neighbors and bonobos share their food. Now he delivers fascinating fresh evidence for the seeds of ethical behavior in primate societies that further cements the case for the biological origins of human fairness. Interweaving vivid tales from the animal kingdom with thoughtful philosophical analysis, de Waal seeks a bottom-up explanation of morality that emphasizes our connection with animals. In doing so, de Waal explores for the first time the implications of his work for our understanding of modern religion. Whatever the role of religious moral imperatives, he sees it as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Johnny-come-latelyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ role that emerged only as an addition to our natural instincts for cooperation and empathy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98e5a213244a7b256f0f7289bbaee11116a978c1","amp;dn":"The+Bonobo+and+the+Atheist%3A+In+Search+of+Humanism+Among+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98e5a213244a7b256f0f7289bbaee11116a978c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,229,162,19,36,74,123,37,111,15,114,137,187,174,225,17,22,169,120,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
