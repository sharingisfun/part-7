Representing the combined effort of 7 editors and more than 200 scholars and scientists whose pioneering work has defined our understanding of stem cells, this book combines the prerequisites for a general understanding of adult and embryonic stem cells with a presentation by the world's experts of the latest research information about specific organ systems. From basic biology/mechanisms, early development, ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm, and methods to the application of stem cells to specific human diseases, regulation and ethics, and patient perspectives, no topic in the field of stem cells is left uncovered.\r\n\r\n- Contributions by Nobel Laureates and leading international investigators\r\n- Includes two entirely new chapters devoted exclusively to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells written by the scientists who made the breakthrough\r\n- Edited by a world-renowned author and researcher to present a complete story of stem cells in research, in application, and as the subject of political debate\r\n- Presented in full color with a glossary, highlighted terms, and bibliographic entries replacing references","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:830fdf62628649118318c5066e21ae25b8976086","amp;dn":"Essentials+of+Stem+Cell+Biology%2C+3rd+Edition+%5B2014%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"830fdf62628649118318c5066e21ae25b8976086","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,15,223,98,98,134,73,17,131,24,197,6,110,33,174,37,184,151,96,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
