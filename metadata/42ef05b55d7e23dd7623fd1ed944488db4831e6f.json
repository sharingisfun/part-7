The country songs shoot for a twisted but classic C+W feel, highlighted by Brett's dry, low-key, Johnny Cash-style vocals with snippets of pedal steel. Also bringing joy to my heart are Rennie's songs about giant ants, the Big Bad Wolf, serial killers, butterflies, ponies, gorillas and that old friend, death. Try to imagine a high IQ Hickoids with a penchant for melody. Influences range from the obvious, Neil Young and Hank Williams, Sr., to the more obscure, which I'll leave you to sort out while listening. They were last seen on the Bloodshot Records Chicago alternative country compilation For a Life of Sin, alongside Freakwater &amp; Jon Langford, doing Moving Furniture Around which they have graciously re-recorded for this album. They also recently had a track on a split 7&quot; with Larry Cash, Jr that surfaced on the Snap! Crackle! Punk! label run by our buddies at Speed Kills. Both have earned them great reviews and radio play in these parts and around the country. Damn, I'm excited about this one!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42ef05b55d7e23dd7623fd1ed944488db4831e6f","amp;dn":"The+Handsome+Family+-+Odessa+%5B1994%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42ef05b55d7e23dd7623fd1ed944488db4831e6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,239,5,181,93,126,35,221,118,35,253,30,217,68,72,141,180,131,30,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
