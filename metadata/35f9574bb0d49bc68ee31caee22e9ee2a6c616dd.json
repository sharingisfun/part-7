WinRAR treats files with .txz extension as .tar.xz archives.\n\n   2. If 7-Zip archive extraction is cancelled, WinRAR deletes\n      the incompletely extracted file. Previous versions did not delete it.\n\n   3. Bugs fixed:\n\n      a) solid archive updating was aborted for archives contaning\n         BLAKE2 checksums;\n      \n      b) folder tree panel did not allow to go to the archive root folder;\n\n      c) &quot;Reuse existing window&quot; option did not work if first WinRAR copy\n         was browsing an archive and second WinRAR copy attempted to open\n         another archive in another folder;\n\n      d) &quot;Advanced compression parameters&quot; dialog settings format in Registry\n         was incompatible with WinRAR 4.20.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35f9574bb0d49bc68ee31caee22e9ee2a6c616dd","amp;dn":"Winrar+5.00+Beta+8+Full+Version+No+key+Required%5BA4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35f9574bb0d49bc68ee31caee22e9ee2a6c616dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,249,87,75,176,212,155,198,142,227,28,174,226,46,158,226,166,198,22,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
