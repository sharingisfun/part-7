No-Cry Sleep covered babies up to age two, but many of the parents are asking what to do about older children who are being awakened by a babyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cries, refusing to go to bed or to stay in bed, having nightmares, or getting into the parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bed at night. This book now provides those parents with gentle, loving solutions to all of the sleep-related problems of children ages 2 through 6.\n\nRecent research has shown that kids who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get enough sleep are far more likely to have behavior problems, be overweight, and have learning problems. But even if that werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the case, childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sleep problems drive parents crazy. This is the book that will help parents regain time to themselves in the evening and better sleep during the night, without resorting to punishments, locking children in their rooms, and other negative (but common) measures.\n\nGenre: Health, Family &amp; Lifestyle, Families &amp; Parents, Pregnancy &amp; Childcare, Parenting","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0ddd459cddcdc88aa81d0ed79ffad7bde63ca11","amp;dn":"The+No-Cry+Sleep+Solution+for+Toddlers+and+Preschoolers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0ddd459cddcdc88aa81d0ed79ffad7bde63ca11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,221,212,89,205,220,220,136,170,129,208,237,121,255,173,123,222,99,202,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
