But her fledgling design agency, Ferroconcrete, has gone on to create award-winning branding campaigns for companies like Pinkberry, TNT, and TBS. As Yo explains it, there are parallels. Branding, like film, is about storytelling. But instead of telling a story over a few minutes or hours, a brand's story is told over a period of months, years, or even decades.\n\nIn this Creative Spark, Yo explains how her team maps the personality of a brand, creates messaging and imagery that support it, and helps clients earn the love and loyalty of their customers. See how this played out for Pinkberry, which under Ferroconcrete's guidance evolved from a single storefront to a nationally recognized name. Yo's team also introduces its fragrance line, Commodity, a project they started to gain firsthand experience building a product alongside the brand. Plus, get a glimpse of the uniquely collaborative design team hard at work in their downtown LA offices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2361024bae7a6c2c0be4a011f997c890bf174dd","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Yo+Santosa_+Branding+Expert+with+Yolanda+Santosa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2361024bae7a6c2c0be4a011f997c890bf174dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,54,16,36,186,231,166,194,192,190,74,1,31,153,124,137,11,241,116,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
