She \nwas one of the pioneers of female punk rock whose most popular hit single was \n&quot;Lucky Number&quot;, first released in 1978.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3218c0a80cf096f5a7b69c32424fc277f292831b","amp;dn":"Lene+Lovich-Flex-Vinylrip-320-Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3218c0a80cf096f5a7b69c32424fc277f292831b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,24,192,168,12,240,150,245,167,182,156,50,66,79,194,119,242,146,131,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
