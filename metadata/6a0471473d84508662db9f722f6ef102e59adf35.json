It compiles information from the open literature, meeting proceedings, and experts to accurately depict the state of gas processing technology today and highlight technologies that could become important in the future.\n\nThis book covers advantages, limitations, and ranges of applicability of major gas plant processes to provide a sound understanding from system fundamentals to selection, operation, and integration into the overall gas plant. It also describes the major operations involved in bringing the gas to the plant, information not usually discussed in most gas processing books. Comprehensive chapters cover field operations, inlet receiving, compression, dehydration, hydrocarbon recovery, nitrogen rejection, liquids processing, sulfur recovery, and the increasingly popular liquefied natural gas industry, focusing on liquefaction, storage, and transportation. The book also discusses plant economics, offering ways to make initial cost estimates of selected processes and determine capital costs of gas processing facilities.\n\nThe descriptive approach in Fundamentals of Natural Gas Processing makes this comprehensive text and reference well suited for both technical and non-technical personnel in the industry including chemical or mechanical engineers, plant engineers, students, and those who are new to the field.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a0471473d84508662db9f722f6ef102e59adf35","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+Of+Natural+Gas+Processing+%282006%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a0471473d84508662db9f722f6ef102e59adf35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,4,113,71,61,132,80,134,98,219,159,114,47,110,241,2,229,154,223,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
