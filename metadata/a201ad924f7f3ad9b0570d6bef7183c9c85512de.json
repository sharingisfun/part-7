Lucinda, an odd child who hears voices, swiftly writes a long string of numbers. In 2009, the capsule is opened; student Caleb Koestler gets LucindaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“drawingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and his father John, an astrophysicist and grieving widower, takes a look. He discovers dates of disasters over the past 50 years with the number who died. Three dates remain, all coming soon. He investigates, learns of Lucinda, and looks for her family. He fears for his son, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s started to hear voices and who is visited by a silent stranger who shows him a vision of fire and destruction.
