Yanking deliberately harsh and grainy shots out of the mix-and-match sonic grab bag called pop history, Zorn compresses them into odd-angled sound bites, shuffles them and then hurls them by in a gleeful assault. Despite patches of relative calm and even innocence, ironic subversion lurks at every turn of phrase.\n\nNaked City was formed a year and a half ago to give Zorn a focused vehicle for his omnivorous compositions and rearrangements. Taking its name from the gritty pulp TV show (&quot;There are eight million stories in the ...&quot;), this collection of downtown all-stars ? Zorn, Bill Frisell on guitar, Wayne Horvitz on keyboards, Fred Frith on bass, Joey Baron on percussion ? did a four-night, eight-set stint at the Knitting Factory, in New York City, last summer, never repeating a tune. Now tightened and toughened by roadwork, the band jump-cuts ? often within a single piece ? from surf-music buoyancy to reggae punch, country twang to film noir sleaze, hardcore slam-dunk to second-line strut, with the kind of grinning, methodical urgency you&amp;#039;d expect from a chain-saw murderer in a rush-hour subway car.\n\nImagine the resulting spatter as a Jackson Pollock canvas, and you&amp;#039;ll begin to understand how Naked City transforms everything it touches. Like, for example, jazz great Ornette Coleman&amp;#039;s &quot;Lonely Woman.&quot; Coleman, a Zorn hero, wrote and played it as a brooding, off-balance elegy, but in this band&amp;#039;s hands, it comes out as a contemporary &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; played by Booker T. and the MG&amp;#039;s. &quot;The Sicilian Clan,&quot; by another Zorn fave, spaghetti westerner Ennio Morricone, curls up in a cocktail lounge with a cheesy Farfisa organ out of &quot;Telstar.&quot; Then there are Zorn&amp;#039;s originals ? raging grungers like &quot;Hammerhead,&quot; mutant cartoon memories like &quot;Snaggle-puss,&quot; skewed beach-blanket bingos like &quot;Batman&quot; and infectious R&amp;B party-downs like &quot;Latin Quarter&quot; ? each produced to mimic its genre&amp;#039;s classic sound.\n\nThink of Zorn as a rapid-fire radio scanner: Part of the listening fun is hanging on for dear life whenever he hits the button. Catch your breath when you can.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba1f4e46325cb7a175d4195fff78d0c52cecbb28","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+Naked+City%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba1f4e46325cb7a175d4195fff78d0c52cecbb28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,31,78,70,50,92,183,161,117,212,25,95,255,120,208,197,44,236,187,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
