The recording of the film took place during concerts in Glasgow, Scotland and Stafford, England in 1976.[2] The film was released in 1977.\n\nSong List:\n1. &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot;\n2. &quot;Fly On A Windshield&quot;\n3. &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot;\n4. &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; (second half)\n5. &quot;Entangled&quot;\n6. &quot;Supper&amp;#039;s Ready&quot; (closing section only, from &quot;Apocalypse in 9/8&quot; onwards)\n7. &quot;Los Endos&quot;\n\nLine-up includes:\n    * Tony Banks - keyboards, guitar, backing vocals\n    * Mike Rutherford - bass, guitar, backing vocals\n    * Steve Hackett - guitar\n    * Phil Collins - vocals, drums, percussion\n    * Bill Bruford - drums, percussion\n\nBackground:\n\nGenesis: In Concert documents the concert tour that Genesis embarked on in 1976, after their album A Trick of the Tail. This was the first album on which Phil Collins assumed the duties of lead vocalist (following the departure of Peter Gabriel). On the album, Collins sings lead vocals and plays drums. But since Collins wanted to focus on his singing duties during live shows, Genesis brought in former Yes and King Crimson drummer Bill Bruford to play drums and percussion during this tour.\n\nThe movie combines film of two shows: one at the Apollo Theatre in Glasgow, Scotland on July 9, 1976, and one at Bingley Hall in Staffordshire, England on either June 15 or July 10, 1976.[3]\n\nDuring the songs &quot;Cinema Show&quot;, &quot;Entangled&quot;, and &quot;Supper&amp;#039;s Ready&quot;, the footage of the concert is combined with other film clips, often in an abstract manner. These portions of the movie could be considered partway between a concert film and a music video.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/23/Genesis_Movie_Poster.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/23/Genesis_Movie_Poster.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f64a36f71a1457eea53395060d1633f192eeb537","amp;dn":"Genesis+-+In+Concert+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f64a36f71a1457eea53395060d1633f192eeb537","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,74,54,247,26,20,87,238,165,51,149,6,13,22,51,241,146,238,181,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
