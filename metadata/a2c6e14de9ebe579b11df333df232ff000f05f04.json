Equally important, he was among the first modern black performers and composers to attend to the business side of the music business, and founded both a record label and a publishing company as an extension of his careers as a singer and composer. Yet, those business interests didn't prevent him from being engaged in topical issues, including the struggle over civil rights, the pitch and intensity of which followed an arc that paralleled Cooke's emergence as a star -- his own career bridged gaps between black and white audiences that few had tried to surmount, much less succeeded at doing, and also between generations; where Chuck Berry or Little Richard brought black and white teenagers together, James Brown sold records to white teenagers and black listeners of all ages, and Muddy Waters got young white folkies and older black transplants from the South onto the same page, Cooke appealed to all of the above, and the parents of those white teenagers as well -- yet he never lost his credibility with his core black audience. In a sense, his appeal anticipated that of the Beatles, in breadth and depth. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B\t\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.You Send Me\n02.(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons\n03.You Were Made For Me\n04.Win Your Love For Me\n05.Love You Most Of All\n06.Everybody Loves To Cha Cha Cha\n07.Only Sixteen\n08.Wonderful World\n09.Chain Gang\n10.Sad Mood\n11.That's It, I Quit, I'm Movin' On\n12.Cupid\n13.Twistin' The Night Away\n14.Having A Party\n15.Bring It On Home To Me\n16.Sugar Dumpling (Original Version)\n17.Nothing Can Change This Love\n18.Somebody Have Mercy\n19.Send Me Some Lovin'\n20.Frankie And Johnny\n21.Little Red Rooster\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2c6e14de9ebe579b11df333df232ff000f05f04","amp;dn":"Sam+Cooke+-+Greatest+Hits+%281998%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2c6e14de9ebe579b11df333df232ff000f05f04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,198,225,77,233,235,229,121,177,29,243,51,223,35,47,240,0,240,95,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
