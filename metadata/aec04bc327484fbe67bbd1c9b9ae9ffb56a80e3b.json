Examples include multimodal and multimedia communications, the biological and biomedical fields, economic models, environmental sciences, acoustics, telecommunications, remote sensing, monitoring, and, in general, the modeling and prediction of complex physical phenomena. The reader will learn not only how to design and implement the algorithms but also how to evaluate their performance for specific applications utilizing the tools provided. While using a simple mathematical language, the employed approach is very rigorous. The text will be of value both for research purposes and for courses of study.\nAbout the Author\nAurelio Uncini is full Professor at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, teaching Circuits Theory, Adaptive Algorithm and Parallel Computing, Digital Audio Processing. He is the director of the laboratory of Intelligent Signal Processing and Multimedia (ISPAMM) and co-founder of Cyber Intelligence and Information Security (CIS) research center at Sapienza University of Rome.\n\nPublisher: Springer; 2015 edition (19 January 2015)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3319028065\nISBN-13: 978-3319028064","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aec04bc327484fbe67bbd1c9b9ae9ffb56a80e3b","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Adaptive+Signal+Processing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aec04bc327484fbe67bbd1c9b9ae9ffb56a80e3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,192,75,195,39,72,79,190,103,187,209,201,185,174,159,251,86,168,14,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
