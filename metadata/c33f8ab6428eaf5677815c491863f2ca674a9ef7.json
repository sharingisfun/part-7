Created by the psychedelic trance pioneer Simon Posford and Benji     ? ?\n  ?    Vaughn the mastermind behind Prometheus and The Egg. The pair team    ? ?\n  ?    up once again to create their second album, a breathtaking album      ? ?\n  ?    with stunning sound production, that takes listeners on an            ? ?\n  ?    incredibly varied musical journey.                                    ? ?\n  ?                                                                          ? ?\n  ?    &amp;#039;The Last Days Of Gravity&amp;#039; is a unique melee of electronic,           ? ?\n  ?    acoustic, and vocal music, running the gamut of beautiful,            ? ?\n  ?    strange, catchy, psychedelic, melancholic, uplifting. Despite its     ? ?\n  ?    consistently psychedelic tone, the album has a very human element     ? ?\n  ?    to it, and you can sense the spirit and emotion that have gone        ? ?\n  ?    into its creation.                                                    ? ?\n  ?                                                                          ? ?\n  ?    The harmonic variety of &amp;#039;Last Days&amp;#039; is particularly mesmerising.      ? ?\n  ?    The bindingly riveting melodic lines provide echoes of Posford&amp;#039;s      ? ?\n  ?    earlier work in Shpongle and Celtic Cross, as well as of his more     ? ?\n  ?    recent collaboration with the legendary Alan Parsons. This album      ? ?\n  ?    is no retro piece of work, however, with Posford and Vaughn&amp;#039;s         ? ?\n  ?    legendary innovation resulting in a complex mix of styles that        ? ?\n  ?    eludes genre-casting. Despite having no obvious dance numbers,        ? ?\n  ?    &amp;#039;The Last Days Of Gravity&amp;#039; provides enough levity to be the           ? ?\n  ?    perfect soundtrack to the richness of daily experience.               ? ?\n  ?                                                                          ? ?\n  ?                                                                          ? ?\n  ? ??????????????????????????+?????[ NCR Info ]??????+??????????????????????? ?\n  ? ?                                                                          ?\n  ? ?                                                                          ?\n  ? ?

Their     ?\n  ? ?  new (enforced) standard is V2 (fair quality) using vbr-new (fast but    ?\n  ? ?  inferior quality algoritm). We chose V0 (best quality) using vbr-old    ?\n  ? ?  (LAMEs &quot;workhorse&quot;, producing the best VBR quliaty rips). Also, when    ?\n  ? ?  we can we use FhG (best encoder) 320 CBR Full Stereo Archive quality    ?\n  ? ?  in our releases.                                                        ?\n  ? ?                                                                          ?\n  ? ?
