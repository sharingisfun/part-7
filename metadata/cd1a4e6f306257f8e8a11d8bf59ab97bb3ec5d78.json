Rowling yet more of your money this year!\n\nMike, Kevin and Bill Dumbledore their way through a Haggrid of laughs in this, the Hogwartiest of all RiffTrax! (We have no idea what any of that means!) \n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rifftrax.com/donate&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rifftrax.com/donate&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd1a4e6f306257f8e8a11d8bf59ab97bb3ec5d78","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+and+The+Sorcerer%5C%27s+Stone+Rifftrax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd1a4e6f306257f8e8a11d8bf59ab97bb3ec5d78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,26,78,111,48,98,87,248,232,161,29,139,245,154,185,123,179,236,93,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
