Oh, no! The king has hidden the crystals in storybooks, and now the Crystal Kingdom is losing its color. Travel with Dora to Dragon land where number skills are needed to show a dragon how to blast away rocks and reveal the yellow crystal. Then, visit a butterfly cave, where kids practice making words with butterfly cocoons to reveal the green crystal. Finally, get out your wand and go head-to-head with that greedy king--and get in some color-recognition practice. When you've recovered the crystals, you can print out the Crystal Kingdom and color it in.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b9a9ce83ed95bbef31fea3db5285b5a3ec364c8","amp;dn":"Dora+Saves+the+Crystal+Kingdom+Kids+Only","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b9a9ce83ed95bbef31fea3db5285b5a3ec364c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,154,156,232,62,217,91,190,243,31,234,61,181,40,91,90,62,195,100,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
