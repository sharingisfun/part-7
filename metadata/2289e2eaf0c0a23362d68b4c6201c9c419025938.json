Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, John Coltrane, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, and Dizzy GillespieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½these are the illustrious names that fill the history of jazz. Burns begins at the beginningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in New OrleansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½then traces jazzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ history from Dixieland to Avant-Garde, from the East Coast to the West Coast, from predictable ensembles to totally free improvising. Jazz wants to re-introduce the viewer to this grand, uniquely American art form; it wants to remind the viewer just how special a Charles Mingus is; and it wants to remind the viewer of the contributions and sacrifices that African Americans have made to bring this music to the culture.\n&quot;Gumbo&quot; traces the roots of jazz from the 1800s to 1917. The viewer will catch glimpses of Jelly Roll Morton, who erroneously claimed to have invented jazz, and the tragic, though influential, figure of trumpeter Buddy Bolden. \nCredits\nKen BurnsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Director/Producer/Cinematography\nLynn Novick--Producer\nGeoffrey C.
