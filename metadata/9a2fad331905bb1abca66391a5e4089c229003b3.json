Now, Lemlin returns to the cookbook shelf for the first time in more than ten years with this dramatic reinvention of her first book - originally published twenty-five years ago as Vegetarian Pleasures: A Menu Cookbook.\n\nSimply SatisfyingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than 200 seasonal recipes showcase readily available ingredients - particularly fresh vegetables, fruits, grains, and beans - as well as straightforward techniques, global influences, and, most delectably and rewardingly, robust flavors. Here are Baked Macaroni and Cheese with Cauliflower and JalapeÃƒÂ±os, Fragrant Vegetable Stew with Corn Dumplings, Leek Timbales with White Wine Sauce, Baked Eggplant Stuffed with Curried Vegetables... and for dessert, Raspberry Almond Torte, Rhubarb Cobbler, and Cowboy Cookies. Each inviting dish is simple enough to be part of a weeknight meal and certain to satisfy vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.\n\nLemlin guides cooks through both everyday and special-occasion cooking by offering 50 menu suggestions, helping new vegetarians avoid the Ã¢â‚¬Å“plateful of sidesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ dilemma, and giving seasoned cooks new ideas for entertaining. And she includes personal tips and a chapter on making Ã¢â‚¬Å“the basicsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from scratch.\n\nWhether you are a committed vegetarian or an omnivore who enjoys hearty meatless meals, Simply Satisfying may well become your most reliable, trusted source of recipes to make again and again.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[N]ovice cooks can whip up healthful, flavorful meals in record time.
