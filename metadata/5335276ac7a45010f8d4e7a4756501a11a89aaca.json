Furie \nProduced by Brad Dexter Jay Weston James S. White\nWritten by Suzanne de Passe Chris Clark Terence McCloy\n\nLady Sings The Blues was nominated for five Academy Awards. \nThe nominations were for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Diana Ross), Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (Carl Anderson, Reg Allen), Best Costume Design, Best Music, Original Song Score and Adaptation (Gil Askey) and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced. The film was also screened at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition. \n\nDiana Ross plays the magnificent, tragic song stylist Billie Holiday, who while writhing in a strait jacket in a prison cell, awaiting sentencing on drug charges, reflects on her turbulent life. Raped in her youth by a drunk (Adolph Caesar), then compelled to work as a domestic in a Harlem whorehouse, Holliday is encouraged to try for a singing career by the bordello\\\\\\'s pianist (Richard Pryor). She rises as high as it is possible to go in the white-dominated show business world of the 1930s, but can\\\\\\'t handle the pressure and turns to narcotics. The film takes several liberties with the 44-year existence of \\\\\\&quot;Lady Day.\\\\\\&quot; Among the Billie Holiday standards performed by Ross are \\\\\\&quot;My Man,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;I Cried for You,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;Lover Man,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;Them There Eyes,\\\\\\&quot; and the title song.\n\n\nCast\n\nDiana Ross as Billie Holiday   Billy Dee Williams as Louis McKay\nRichard Pryor as Piano Man    James Callahan as Reg Hanley (as James Callahan)\nPaul Hampton as Harry   Sid Melton as Jerry\nVirginia Capers as Mama Holiday   Yvonne Fair as Yvonne\nIsabel Sanford as Madame    Tracee Lyles as Prostitute\nNed Glass as Agent   Milton Selzer as Doctor\nNorman Bartold as The Detective #1  Clay Tanner as Detective #2\nJester Hairston as Fefe   Bert Kramer as The Policeman\nPaul Micale as The Maitre d\\\\\\'  Michelle Aller as The Singer\nByron Kane as The Announcer  Barbara Minkus as Radio Actress\nKay Lewis as Angela DeMarco  Helen Lewis as Debbie McGee\nGeorge Wyner as The M.C.
