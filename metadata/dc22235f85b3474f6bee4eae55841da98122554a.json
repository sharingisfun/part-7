Even if the vocal synthesis technology is a revolution of the software, its installations and systems are far from perfect. POCALOID was hacked and optimized for creators, the best way to use VOCALOID technology.\n\nThe advantage of POCALOID\n\nFixed from VOCALOID - Installation\n* Some softwares interrupt the installation (Don't happen in POCALOID)\n* Can't install/uninstall bug (Don't happen in POCALOID)\n* Misregistration of file (Fixed in POCALOID)\n* Wrong Version Installation (Don't happen in POCALOID)\n* Complicated and heavy installer (POCALOID installer is simple and light)\n* Problem with unused RegKey (POCALOID doesn't install/use these keys)\n* Problem with HDD capacity (Don't happen in POCALOID)\n\nFixed from VOCALOID - System\n\n* Number limited, and unstable C&amp;R protection (Removed in POCALOID)\n* Sensitive KeyFile (POCALOID2 Manager can rebuild this)\n* Sensitive RegKey (POCALOID2 was hacked to avoid those problems)\n* Worst TimeBomb which cause to Legal User too (Removed in POCALOID)\n* Some ReWire bugs (Fixed in POCALOID)\n\nPOCALOID Feature \n\n* Support POCALOID2 Plugin (Allow Fixer is now supported)\n* Installation checker and fixer\n* Registry cleaner\n* Voice Database Map manager\n* Simple and proper installation/uninstallation\n* Improved GUI\n* Additional English dictionary from Crypton\n* Run POCALOID2 Editor from ReWire Device\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nQ: Can I use Japanese Singer in English?\nA: Yes you can. Details on our POCALOID2 Manager manual with a picture.\n\nQ: Can POCALOID2 exist with legal VOCALOID2?\nA: Yes it can, but not recommended.\n\nQ: Does VOCALOID2 Library work in POCALOID2?\nA: No it doesn't. POCALOID can read our POCALOID libraries only.\n\nQ: Your previous English VOCALOID Editor was half translated!\nA: This version would satisfy you!\n\nNote from uploader of torrent:\nI went through the hard agonizing work of downloading every .rar file and compiling them into the .iso files.\n\nPOCALOID2 is exactly like VOCALOID2 in look and feel, so you can even trick yourself into thinking it's VOCALOID2. I'm not a member of peace-out, but personally I even prefer it to the original VOCALOID2 editor, as it fixed several bugs I hated in the original software. It also installs quickly (downloading is slower than installing).\n\nPlease, please, please read the readme. Also, remember to download only the voices you want. If you already have the other VOCALOID2 software, they're two separate programs, so you can have them both on the same computer without worrying about things screwing up.\n\nVoices inside this torrent:\nHatsune Miku\nKagamine Rin\nKagamine Len\nKagamine Rin act.2\nKagamine Len act.2\nMegurine Luka (English)\nMegurine Luka (Japanese)\nHatsune Miku append dark beta\nHatsune Miku append soft beta\nMegpoid\nGackpoid\nSweet Ann\nSonika\nPrima\nSF-A2 miki\nHiyama Kiyoteru\nKaai Yuki\n\n\nRegarding Big-Al, ASSiGN currently does not have their hands on him, but there will most likely be a release.\n\nIf you wish to use a torrent that has the voices of Miku Append, please visit http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5565206.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc22235f85b3474f6bee4eae55841da98122554a","amp;dn":"POCALOID2+-+all+voices+of+VOCALOID2+%28Vocaloid%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc22235f85b3474f6bee4eae55841da98122554a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,34,35,95,133,179,71,79,107,238,78,174,85,132,29,169,129,34,85,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
