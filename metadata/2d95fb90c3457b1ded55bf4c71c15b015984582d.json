It is a science fiction series set in the present day, consisting of single-issue, standalone stories. The series of twelve issues was published between October 2002 and September 2003. Each issue was drawn by a different artist, with uniform covers by Brian Wood, and interior artwork colored by David Baron.\n\nThe Global Frequency is an independent, covert intelligence organization headed by a former intelligence agent who uses the alias of Miranda Zero. There are reportedly 1,001 people on the Global Frequency, forming an active smart mob communicating by specially modified video mobile phones through a central dispatch system coordinated by a young woman code-named Aleph, after the short story &quot;The Aleph,&quot; by Jorge Luis Borges.\n\nThe purpose of the organization is to protect and rescue the world from the consequences of the various secret projects that the governments of the world have established, which are unknown to the public at large. The people on the Global Frequency are chosen and called on for their specialized skills in a variety of areas, from military personnel, intelligence agents, police detectives to scientific researchers, academics, athletes, former criminals and assassins. These threats that the organization deals with are equally varied and usually world-threatening, ranging from rogue military operations and paranormal phenomena to terrorist attacks and religious cults.\n\nThe existence of the organization is an open secret, but its membership list is anonymous, the identities of its field agents unknown to even each other before they meet on a mission. Often the only way to tell a member of the Global Frequency is by the phones that they carry or the Global Frequency symbolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a stylized sunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that they sport somewhere on their person.\n\nWho exactly funds the Global Frequency is not known. Zero has said that at least some of the money comes from the G8 governments who pay the Frequency for not revealing the various secret horrors they deal with. Although the presence of an independent, unaccountable agency with strike capability makes some authorities nervous, they also recognize the fact that the Frequency has the skills, the reach and, more importantly, the will to act where they cannot. As a result, the organization gets tacit approval for its activities, and is sometimes called on by governments to deal with extraordinary crises. Mostly, however, the organization acts proactively as it discovers such threats.\n\nIn a departure from the usual serial nature of modern comic books, Ellis designed the comic like a television series with standalone &quot;episodes&quot;, allowing the reader to come in at any point in the series and be able to understand what was going on. As a result, the only regular characters in the series are Miranda Zero and Aleph, with only a few other characters making a reappearance in the twelfth issue of the series. This also heightened the suspense, as the reader did not know if these characters would survive the mission, which sometimes they did not.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d95fb90c3457b1ded55bf4c71c15b015984582d","amp;dn":"Global+Frequency+%231-12+%5BWarren+Ellis+-+Wildstorm%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d95fb90c3457b1ded55bf4c71c15b015984582d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,149,251,144,195,69,123,29,237,85,191,76,113,193,91,1,89,132,88,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
