Gomer Pyle became a character on the TV sitcom The Andy Griffith Show, when actor Howard McNear, who played Floyd the barber, suffered a stroke and took a respite from acting. Jim Nabors was contracted to play Pyle, and did so for 27 episodes from 1962ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1964.[1] After two years of appearances on The Andy Griffith Show, McNear returned and Andy Griffith went to the producers seeking a vehicle for Nabors' Gomer Pyle. In 1964 the character was spun-off in a sitcom akin to No Time for Sergeants, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.,[2] which ran until 1969.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50ed3833bba9ad5ab28bff820e7998a8f496d741","amp;dn":"Gomer+Pyle+-+All+seasons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50ed3833bba9ad5ab28bff820e7998a8f496d741","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,237,56,51,187,169,173,90,178,139,255,130,14,121,152,168,244,150,215,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
