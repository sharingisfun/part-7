This revised and updated version explains the three major types of relationshipsÃ¢â‚¬â€personal, functional, and strategicÃ¢â‚¬â€and how to focus each to fuel enterprise growth. It introduces new concepts in relationship management, including the exchange of Relationship Currency, the accumulation of Reputation Capital, and the building of Professional Net Worth. These are the fundamental measures of business relationship, and once you understand them, you'll be able to turn your contacts into better executions, performance, and results.\n\n&quot;David Nour is the definitive expert on strategic relationships.
