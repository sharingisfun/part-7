This volume offers a concise and compelling account of how these intelligent and well-educated legal professionals lent their skills and knowledge to a system of oppression and domination. The chapters address why German lawyers and jurists were attracted to Nazism; how their support of the regime resulted from a combination of ideological conviction, careerist opportunism, and legalistic self-delusion; and whether they were held accountable for their Nazi-era actions after 1945. This book also examines the experiences of Jewish lawyers who fell victim to anti-Semitic measures. The volume will appeal to scholars, students, and other readers with an interest in Nazi Germany, the Holocaust, and the history of jurisprudence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3c0d1cba9a4a2f140d2da5ad5f4700f462ac2db","amp;dn":"The+Law+in+Nazi+Germany+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3c0d1cba9a4a2f140d2da5ad5f4700f462ac2db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,192,209,203,169,164,162,241,64,210,218,90,213,244,112,15,70,42,194,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
