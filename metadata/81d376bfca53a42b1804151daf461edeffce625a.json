All of this is a pity, because Halffter was a major composer, as two secondâ€™s listening to the delicious Sinfonietta clearly demonstrates. This outstanding neo-classical work combines the features of a symphony with those of a concerto grosso, offering lively solos for the principal strings, winds, and even two differently pitched snare drums. The music will flood your listening room with Spanish sunshine and good humor, except in the remarkable slow movement, whose religious inspiration builds at its conclusion to a rapture bordering on ecstasy. Adrian Leaper and his Spanish band deliver a fine performance, though another recent release featuring the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra under Muhai Tang (on CPO) is just as fine, and perhaps marginally livelier. That recording also includes the brief, impressionistic diptych called Two Symphonic Sketches...&quot; --David Hurwitz (from the review of Adrian Leaper's recording of the Sinfonietta on ASV 1078)\r\n\r\n1.
