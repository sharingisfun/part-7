(Elsevier, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nThis third volume in the series represents the Proceedings of the 3rd International Nanophotonics Symposium, July 6-8, 2006, Icho-Kaikan, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan. Over a two-day symposium, distinguished scientists from around the world convened to discuss the latest progress in this field and the conclusions have been summarised in Nano Biophotonics: Science and Technology. The contents of this book have been compiled by invited lecturers, research members of the relevant projects/program, and some of general participants. The book has 27 chapters which are classified into 4 parts; nano bio-spectroscopy, nano bio-dynamics, nano bio-processing, and nano bio-devices.\r\n\r\n* Bridges the gap between conventional photophysics &amp; photochemistry and nanoscience\r\n* Continuing the series that focuses on 'hot' areas of photochemistry, optics, material science and bioscience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac6055d740fb5b5cea89e31cca68d0e5609ca320","amp;dn":"Nano+Biophotonics+-+Science+and+Technology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac6055d740fb5b5cea89e31cca68d0e5609ca320","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,96,85,215,64,251,91,92,234,137,227,28,202,104,208,229,96,156,163,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
