CleggÃ¢â‚¬â€who studied physics at Cambridge University and specializes in making the strangest aspects of the universe accessible to the general reader Ã¢â‚¬â€explores the Quantum Age, the revolution led by our understanding of the very, very small.\n\nAtoms, electrons, and photons of light are all quantum particles, acting totally unlike the objects we experience. This weird quantum behavior lies at the heart of every electronic device and powers lasers in everything from DVDs to eye correction. It is also behind quantum biology, the astonishing new realization that biological functions, from our ability to see and photosynthesis in plants to the amazing ability of birds to navigate, rely directly on quantum effects.\n\nWe've all heard about how odd quantum theory is. But in this book, for the first time, Clegg reveals to a popular science audience precisely how useful it is. Incredible revelations along the way will thrill popular science fans and general readers alike.\n\nBrian Clegg is an acclaimed science writer published by Icon Books and St. Martin's Press. His books include Inflight Science, Dice World (forthcoming), The Universe Inside You, Gravity, and Extra-Sensory.\n\nPublisher: Icon Books (November 11, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 184831664X\nISBN-13: 978-1848316645\n\nBiography\nBrian's most recent books are Dice World and Extra Sensory. He has written a range of other science titles, including the bestselling Inflight Science, The God Effect, Before the Big Bang, Ecologic, A Brief History of Infinity and Build Your Own Time Machine.\n\nAlong with appearances at the Royal Institution in London he has spoken at venues from Oxford and Cambridge Universities to Cheltenham Festival of Science, has contributed to radio and TV programmes, and is a popular speaker at schools. Brian is also editor of the successful www.popularscience.co.uk book review site and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.\n\nBrian has Masters degrees from Cambridge University in Natural Sciences and from Lancaster University in Operational Research, a discipline originally developed during the Second World War to apply the power of mathematics to warfare. It has since been widely applied to problem solving and decision making in business.\n\nBrian has also written regular columns, features and reviews for numerous publications, including Nature, The Guardian, PC Week, Computer Weekly, Personal Computer World, The Observer, Innovative Leader, Professional Manager, BBC History, Good Housekeeping and House Beautiful. His books have been translated into many languages, including German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Polish, Turkish, Norwegian, Thai and even Indonesian","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:108015d4e0e5b91c6a72690e63dc638c095a861b","amp;dn":"%5BBrian+Clegg%5DThe+Quantum+Age+How+the+Physics+of+the+Very+Small+h","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"108015d4e0e5b91c6a72690e63dc638c095a861b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,128,21,212,224,229,185,28,106,114,105,14,99,220,99,140,9,90,134,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
