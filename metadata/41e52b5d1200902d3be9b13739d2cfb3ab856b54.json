Shyness and &quot;bloopers&quot; can be turned into assets, comments King, who relates how he clammed up the first time he was on a radio show. By openly admitting his nervousness, he claims he disarmed his listeners. Filled with practical advice, amusing anecdotes and a chapter on his &quot;best and worst guests,&quot; this self-help guide, written with freelancer Gilbert, will be a hit with King devotees.\n\nYou might not be as smooth a talker as King after finishing this book, but it doesn't hurt to try. King, who has talked to everyone from Gorbachev to Michael Jackson, tells us how he does it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInfo\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI was unable to find a PDF of this book, so I purchased the book legitimately.
