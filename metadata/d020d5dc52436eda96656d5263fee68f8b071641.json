Recent pioneering experiments in neuroplasticityÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe ability of the brain to change in response to experienceÃ¢â‚¬â€œreveal that the brain is capable of altering its structure and function, and even of generating new neurons, a power we retain well into old age. The brain can adapt, heal, renew itself after trauma, compensate for disabilities, rewire itself to overcome dyslexia, and break cycles of depression and OCD. And as scientists are learning from studies performed on Buddhist monks, it is not only the outside world that can change the brain, so can the mind and, in particular, focused attention through the classic Buddhist practice of mindfulness. \n\nWith her gift for making science accessible, meaningful, and compelling, Sharon Begley illuminates a profound shift in our understanding of how the brain and the mind interact and takes us to the leading edge of a revolution in what it means to be human.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d020d5dc52436eda96656d5263fee68f8b071641","amp;dn":"Consumer+Guide+to+Home+Energy+Savings+%2B+Train+Your+Mind%2C+Change+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d020d5dc52436eda96656d5263fee68f8b071641","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,32,213,220,82,67,110,218,150,101,109,82,99,254,230,143,139,7,22,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
