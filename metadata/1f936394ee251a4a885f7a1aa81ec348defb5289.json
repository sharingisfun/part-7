After a power surge, an emergency shutdown was attempted and after a subsequent power spike, there was a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions. The cascading course of events led to exposing the graphite moderator of the reactor to the air, causing it to catch fire. This sent a plume of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere.\r\nThe fallout from Chernobyl prompted mass evacuations as it drifted over an extensive geographical area, including the western Soviet Union and Europe. Over 350,000 people were resettled from contaminated areas of Belarus, Russia, and the Ukraine. Thirty-one deaths are directly attributed to the accident, and all the deaths were among reactor staff and emergency workers.\r\nThis is the kind of atmosphere Nelson and Ochota are investigating on Life After: Chernobyl as they attempt to determine how the radiation continues to impact the affected areas. They are allowed to stay for as long as they need to in order to conduct their ground-breaking research, but the duo must also be sure to take the necessary safety precautions. Broadway World noted in their Life After: Chernobyl article that by staying in the area for too long, the radiation exposure could reach dangerously high levels in their bodies, and they must always monitor the radiation levels.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8e/Life-After-Chernobyl-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/46/Life-After-Chernobyl-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/40/Life-After-Chernobyl-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Life-After-Chernobyl-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2f/Life-After-Chernobyl-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/99/Life-After-Chernobyl-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e4/Life-After-Chernobyl-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/18/Life-After-Chernobyl-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e6/Life-After-Chernobyl-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/Life-After-Chernobyl-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/db/Life-After-Chernobyl-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/21/Life-After-Chernobyl-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3011 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 41mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 925 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.inquisitr.com/3031899/life-after-chernobyl-examines-radiation-effects-on-plant-and-animal-life/\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Inside%20Chernobyl%27s%20Sarcophagus \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Battle%20of%20Chernobyl \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Chernobyl%3A%20A%20Natural%20History \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Chernobyl%20Nuclear%20Disaster \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Nuclear%20Nightmares","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f936394ee251a4a885f7a1aa81ec348defb5289","amp;dn":"Life+After+Chernobyl+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f936394ee251a4a885f7a1aa81ec348defb5289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,147,99,148,238,37,26,74,136,95,122,26,168,30,195,72,222,251,82,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
