Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights was first published in London in 1847, appearing as the first two volumes of a three-volume set that included Anne BrontÃƒÂ«'s Agnes Grey. The authors were printed as being Ellis and Acton Bell; Emily's real name didn't appear until 1850, when it was printed on the title page of an edited commercial edition. The novel's innovative structure somewhat puzzled critics.\n\nWuthering Heights is the eponymous farmhouse on the Yorkshire moors where the story unfolds. The book's core theme is the destructive effect that jealousy and vengefulness have, both on the jealous or vengeful individuals and on their communities.\n\nCHARLOTTE BRONTE\n\nCharlotte Bronte ( 21 April 1816 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 31 March 1855) was an English novelist and poet, the eldest of the three Bronte sisters who survived into adulthood, whose novels are English literature standards. She wrote Jane Eyre under the pen name Currer Bell.\n\nCharlotte's first manuscript, The Professor, did not secure a publisher, although she was heartened by an encouraging response from Smith, Elder &amp; Co of Cornhill, who expressed an interest in any longer works which &quot;Currer Bell&quot; might wish to send. Charlotte responded by finishing and sending a second manuscript in August 1847, and six weeks later Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, was published. It tells the story of a plain governess (Jane) who, after early life difficulties, falls in love with her employer, Mr Rochester. They marry, but only after Rochester's insane first wife (of whom Jane initially had no knowledge) dies in a dramatic house fire.\n\nCharlotte believed art was most convincing when based on personal experience; in Jane Eyre she transformed the experience into a novel with universal appeal. Commercially it was an instant success, and initially received favourable reviews.\n\nANNE BRONTE\n\nAnne Bronte (17 January 1820 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 28 May 1849) was a British novelist and poet, the youngest member of the Bronte literary family.\n\nThe daughter of a poor Irish clergyman in the Church of England, Anne BrontÃƒÂ« lived most of her life with her family at the parish of Haworth on the Yorkshire moors. For a couple of years she went to a boarding school. At the age of 19 she left Haworth and worked as a governess between 1839 and 1845. After leaving her teaching position, she fulfilled her literary ambitions. She wrote a volume of poetry with her sisters (Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, 1846) and two novels. Agnes Grey, based upon her experiences as a governess, was published in 1847. Her second and last novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, which is considered to be one of the first sustained feminist novels, appeared in 1848. Anne's life was cut short when she died of pulmonary tuberculosis at the age of 29.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:177dbfea18da4d551eb9a2e6707203b38d86125d","amp;dn":"E-Book+Collection+of+Bronte+Sisters+-+Anne%2C+Charlotte+%26amp%3B+Emil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"177dbfea18da4d551eb9a2e6707203b38d86125d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,125,191,234,24,218,77,85,30,185,162,230,112,114,3,179,141,134,18,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
