Founded in Los Angeles in 1967 by musicians who had a mixture of rock, pop, folk, blues, classical, and jazz backgrounds, and who ranged in age from 16 to 44, the group had an eclectic musical style in keeping with the early days of progressive rock; they were as likely to play a folk ballad featuring fingerpicked acoustic guitar, a jazz instrumental full of imaginative improvisation, or a driving rhythm tune dominated by acid rock electric guitar playing. The diverse tastes of the original quintet produced a hybrid style that delighted a core audience of fans but proved too wide-ranging to attract a mass following, and at the same time the musicians&amp;#039; acknowledged talents brought them other opportunities that led to the breakup of the original lineup after four years and four albums, then kept them from committing fully to regroupings as their music began to be recognized in later years. While two bandmembers, singer/guitarist Randy California and drummer Ed Cassidy, maintained the Spirit name, the others came and went as their schedules allowed, such that the group never fulfilled its early promise, although, as a vehicle for California&amp;#039;s songwriting and guitar playing, it continued to produce worthwhile music until his death.ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¨\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ba6c94757663ae712cf7bd9f92847ae6b94aaaa","amp;dn":"Spirit+-+2%2B+Albums%2FSpirit%2FClear%2F12+Dreams+%28mp3%40320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ba6c94757663ae712cf7bd9f92847ae6b94aaaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,166,201,71,87,102,58,231,18,207,123,217,249,40,71,174,107,148,170,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
