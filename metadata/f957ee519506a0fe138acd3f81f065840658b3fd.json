Lead singer Paul Rodgers went on to become lead singer of the rock band Bad Company along with Simon Kirke on drums. Lead guitarist Paul Kossoff, a much revered blues-rock guitarist, died from a drug-induced heart failure at the age of 25 in 1976.\n\nThe band was famed for its sensational live shows and nonstop touring. However, early studio albums did not sell very well ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ until the release of Fire and Water which featured the massive hit &quot;All Right Now&quot;. This album brought them to full status as one of the top rock bands of the 1960sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“70s. The song helped secure them a place at the huge Isle of Wight Festival 1970 where they played to 600,000 people.\n\nBy the early '70s, Free was one of the biggest-selling British blues-rock groups; by the time the band dissolved in 1973, they had achieved an uncanny level of superstar success: selling more than 20 million albums around the world and had played more than 700 arena and festival concerts. &quot;All Right Now,&quot; remains a rock staple, and has been entered into ASCAP's &quot;One Million&quot; airplay singles club.\n\nRolling Stone has referred to the band as &quot;British hard rock pioneers&quot;.The magazine ranked Rodgers #55 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;,while Kossoff was ranked #51 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n1-Walk in my shadow\n2-Goin' down slow\n3-I'm a mover\n4-Moonshine\n5-Sugar for Mr Morrison \n6-I'll be creepin'\n7-Lying in the sunshine\n8-Woman\n9-Songs of yesterday\n10-Mouthful of grass\n11-All right now (single version)\n12-Don't say you love me\n13-Heavy load\n14-Oh I wept\n15-Fire and water\n16-Mr Big\n17-Be my friend\n \n\n1-The stealer\n2-The highway song\n3-Soon I will be gone\n4-Ride on a pony\n5-My brother Jake\n6-Trouble on double time (live)\n7-Mr Big (live)\n8-The hunter (live)\n9-Fire and water (live)\n10-Crossroads (live)\n11-Magic ship\n12-Travellin' man\n13-Catch a train\n14-Little bit of love\n15-Muddy water\n16-Wishing well\n17-Easy on my soul\n18-Heartbreaker\n\n                       Thank you for seeding :o)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f957ee519506a0fe138acd3f81f065840658b3fd","amp;dn":"Free+-+The+Very+Best+Of+--2+CD--","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f957ee519506a0fe138acd3f81f065840658b3fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,87,238,81,149,6,160,254,19,138,205,63,129,240,101,132,6,88,179,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
