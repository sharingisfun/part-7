These songs are simultaneously gentle and urgent, evoking moments of\ntremendous joy and sorrow with the magnitude of Italian opera and the modesty of\na Japanese haiku.\nUnder Sharas gaze, ordinary objects begin to have supernatural meanings. A\nrobins nest, a grocery list, a glass bottle come to represent love, mortality,\nand the overwhelming need to &quot;freak out&quot; every once in a while. Shara is not\nafraid to use superlatives. But she also considers the benefits of self-control.\nThis is most evident in the carefulness of her arrangements. Earthy drums and\nbass guitar are augmented by Celeste, music boxes, prepared piano, and a string\nquartet; each song is scrupulously composed and arranged by Shara herself.\nSharas songwriting reconciles the high art of opera with the low-brow of the\nfolk song by compounding them into a form that is both as sublime as it is\npragmatic. The music is set in transcendent landscapes familiar to Wagners\noperas, but it is also planted firmly in the materials of everyday life: dirt,\ntree branches, bird feathers and thrown away charms. Strings and chimes beckon\nmysterious apparitions, but Sharas tone of voice is dead serious.\nAlmost every song pivots around a moment of crisis, distilling stories to their\nmost distressing points of contact: a phone call, an injured horse, a dragonfly\ncaught in a spiders web. Shara doesnt share all the information  just the\nstuff that matters. The effect is a sensational compression of time, in which an\nentire event is summarized in a single note. This, of course, is the essence of\nopera. But My Brightest Diamond is much more than musical theater.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a49eff8142e5be7c86d5de18ca63dd26491a9ac","amp;dn":"My_Brightest_Diamond-Bring_Me_The_Workhorse-2006-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a49eff8142e5be7c86d5de18ca63dd26491a9ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,73,239,248,20,46,91,231,200,109,93,225,140,166,61,210,100,145,169,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
