That is the case with this complete recording of Nutcracker (Recorded DDD 1988). I've listened to all acclaimed recordings of this masterpiece by late Tchaikovsky, this one towers high over the rest.\n\nIt sounds as if Svetlanov is determined to show the world that Nutcracker is as great as Wagner's Ring. First thing which strikes you is the enormity of dynamic range in the climax in the Night scene, Pine-forest scene and Pas de deux. Blazing brass bursts out like in Scriabin's Poem of Ecstasy in Pas de deux with gigantic climax. You could not imagine more passionate performance.\n\nHowever, that does not mean all is bombastic emotional roller coaster. Svetlanov is very sensitive with detail and mood of each scene as well as perfectly judged tempi for each piece. Celesta in Sugar-Plum Fairy Scene is the most vivid and intricate I ever come across. The children's chorus in the Snowflake scene has magical atmosphere as if sounding from other world. If you get tired of pettiness of this world, listen to this recording. All the care will melt away!\n\nLastly, recording engineers did excellent job of capturing warmth, detail and the huge dynamic range of the orchestra. There's no distortion even at the most overwhelming moment.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36479a18284bef2e787fa57147420cfb25fdbc8d","amp;dn":"Tchaikovsky+The+Nutcracker+Svetlanov+mp3+320+1988","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36479a18284bef2e787fa57147420cfb25fdbc8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,71,154,24,40,75,239,46,120,127,165,113,71,66,12,251,37,253,188,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
