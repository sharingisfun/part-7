This is the native version of the game Hope you guys enjoy and please help seed.\n\nChangelog for version 1.2.2: \n\n\nGeneral \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Game-wide performance improvements across all platforms! \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: First gold producing dirt block in Plains would drop two coins on top of one another. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: Possible crash involving Mr. Hat Boss. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: Miscellaneous crash fixes. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: Inching past an open (but not rummaged through) treasure chest with the charge slash no longer snaps Shovel Knight back to the chest. Still hilarious. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Devices: Support for SnesMayflashAdapter, Retrobit NES adapter, and Buffalo Famicom Controller. Welcome, native game padders! \n\nLinux \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Game now respects SDL_AUDIODRIVER environment variable. Fixes some setups having \nno audio at all! \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: Mail of Momentum providing an extra jump for Shovel Knight. Consider it a sneak peak at Plague Knight! \n\nThanks and have a nice day :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e21e8bb0534dfc3c4812083eb346745ec44981cd","amp;dn":"Shovel+Knight+%28Linux%29+%28Latest+With+1.2.2+Patch%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e21e8bb0534dfc3c4812083eb346745ec44981cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,30,139,176,83,77,252,60,72,18,8,62,179,70,116,94,196,73,129,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
