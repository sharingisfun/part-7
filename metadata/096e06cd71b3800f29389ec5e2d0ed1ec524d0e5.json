With all but five tracks coming from their 1962-1969 peak, and every one a Top 40 hit, Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of the Beach Boys is also the best, a worthy digital-age successor to previous classics like Endless Summer and Greatest Hits, Vol. 1. Though the songs don't appear in chronological order, the compilers improved the concept of a hits compilation by bunching the disc into minisets -- one of classic adolescence songs (&quot;Be True to Your School,&quot; &quot;When I Grow Up [To Be a Man],&quot; &quot;In My Room&quot;), one of surfing songs (&quot;Surfin' Safari,&quot; &quot;Surfin' U.S.A.,&quot; &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;), one of frat-boy classics (&quot;Dance, Dance, Dance,&quot; &quot;Barbara Ann&quot;), and another including selections from their masterpiece Pet Sounds (&quot;God Only Knows,&quot; &quot;Sloop John B.,&quot; &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;). Nearly any compilation on an important artist can be argued, but it's the rare one that covers as many bases and leaves out so few classics as Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of the Beach Boys. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.73% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tCapitol\nCatalog:\t\t72435-82710-2-7\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.California Girls\n02.I Get Around\n03.Surfin' Safari\n04.Surfin' U.S.A.\n05.Fun, Fun, Fun\n06.Surfer Girl\n07.Don't Worry Baby (Single Version)\n08.Little Deuce Coupe\n09.Shut Down\n10.Help Me, Rhonda (Single Version)\n11.Be True To Your School (Single Version)\n12.When I Grow Up (To Be A Man)\n13.In My Room\n14.God Only Knows\n15.Sloop John B\n16.Wouldn't It Be Nice\n17.Getcha Back\n18.Come Go With Me\n19.Rock And Roll Music\n20.Dance, Dance, Dance\n21.Barbara Ann (Single Version)\n22.Do You Wanna Dance?\n23.Heroes And Villains\n24.Good Timin'\n25.Kokomo\n26.Do It Again\n27.Wild Honey\n28.Darlin'\n29.I Can Hear Music\n30.Good Vibrations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:096e06cd71b3800f29389ec5e2d0ed1ec524d0e5","amp;dn":"Sounds+Of+Summer+Very+Best+Of+The+Beach+Boys+%282003%29+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"096e06cd71b3800f29389ec5e2d0ed1ec524d0e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,110,6,205,113,179,128,15,41,56,158,197,226,208,237,30,197,36,208,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
