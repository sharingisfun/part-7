In the meantime, they are very low on the totem pole and living in Newark. One day at the tracks, they bet their boss' money on the WRONG horse, thinking it would win and they could make off with the cash. Well, it's not their lucky day! When their boss finds out he offers each his life in exchange for a favor: He must kill his best friend. They are warned that there is a hit out on them, so they steal The Fixer's (Albano) car, a pink Cadillac, and off they go to Atlantic City to Bobby's (Harvey Keitel), casino to stay. This is possibly the most hilarious section of the film, with a brisk pace, and several twists and turns in the plot. Yes, even though it is a comedy, DePalma throws in a terrific last minute twist that is utterly climatic and fantastic and hilarious.\n\n  Starring: Danny DeVito, Joe Piscopo, Harvey Keitel, Ray Sharkey, Dan Hedaya.\n\n  Directed by: Brian De Palma.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 31min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 448","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de5101ef28f46054541b8458d12b4668e3625167","amp;dn":"Wise+Guys+%281986%29+%28Danny+DeVito%2C+Joe+Piscopo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de5101ef28f46054541b8458d12b4668e3625167","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,81,1,239,40,244,96,84,84,27,132,88,209,43,70,104,227,98,81,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
