On one level, that perception is true since he is undoubtedly a gifted pop songwriter, but at his core Rundgren is a rock &amp; roll maverick. Once he had a taste of success with his 1972 masterwork, Something/Anything?, Rundgren chose to abandon stardom and, with it, conventional pop music. He began a course through uncharted musical territory, becoming a pioneer not only in electronic music and prog rock, but in music video, computer software, and Internet music delivery as well.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/todd-rundgren-p5322/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/todd-rundgren-p5322/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):\n\nThe Very Best of Todd Rundgren distills the Runt's career to just the hit singles, which is surprisingly effective. Most casual Todd fans will only want the hits -- &quot;We Gotta Get You a Woman,&quot; &quot;I Saw the Light,&quot; &quot;Hello, It's Me,&quot; &quot;Bang on the Drum&quot; -- and not invest in the double-disc set Anthology (1968-1985), which simply contains too much music for most listeners. With The Very Best of, all of the good stuff (including &quot;The Want of a Nail,&quot; which is not on Anthology) is here, satisfying the needs of the casual and curious.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-todd-rundgren-r308467&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-todd-rundgren-r308467&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000003420&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000003420&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
