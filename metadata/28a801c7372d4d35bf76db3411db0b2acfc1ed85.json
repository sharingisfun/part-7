On his first day, Mike befriends the nerdy and shy Randall &quot;Randy&quot; Boggs, who desires to be popular and has difficulty controlling his camouflage power. While studying scaring one night, Mike encounters an arrogant, playful, all-brawn, large blue monster named James P. &quot;Sulley&quot; Sullivan, who is in the same dorm as he and breaks into Mike's room to hide a Scare Pig named Archie, who is the mascot of rival college, Fear Tech. After greeting each other, Archie steals Mike's hat and he and Sulley follow Archie outside where they have a struggle to capture Archie. When they do catch Archie, Sulley is invited to join Roar Omega Roar, the top fraternity on campus. Mike tries to join, but an argument with Sulley leads a rivalry between the two.\n\nWhile the duo compete to see who's the better scarer for part of the semester, Dean Hardscrabble, the stern headmistress of the MU scaring program, says to the students in Professor Knight's class that an exam will be given at the end of the semester, with the ones who failed being forced out of the scaring program. Eventually, Mike and Sulley's petty competition gets out of hand and causes a mistake that Dean Hardscrabble expels them from the program and also results in Sulley getting kicked off his fraternity. Sulley and others have a hard time believing that Mike could be a good scarer. Mike finds out that Dean Hardscrabble will probably let him rejoin the program if he joins a fraternity competing in the upcoming Scare Games, a series of physical challenges that tests a monster's scaring ability. However, he is ostracized by all the fraternities.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28a801c7372d4d35bf76db3411db0b2acfc1ed85","amp;dn":"Monsters+University+TSXviD.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28a801c7372d4d35bf76db3411db0b2acfc1ed85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,168,1,199,55,45,77,53,191,118,219,52,17,219,11,42,207,193,237,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
