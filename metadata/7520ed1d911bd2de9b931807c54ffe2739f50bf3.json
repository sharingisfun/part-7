Tao Pang presents many step-by-step examples, including program listings in JavaTM, of practical numerical methods from modern physics and related areas. Now including many more exercises, the volume can be used as a textbook for either undergraduate or first-year graduate courses on computational physics or scientific computation. It will also be a useful reference for anyone involved in computational research.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPaperback: 402 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press; 2 edition (June 10, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0521532760\nISBN-13: 978-0521532761\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7520ed1d911bd2de9b931807c54ffe2739f50bf3","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Computational+Physics+by+Tao+Pang+%5B%3D%3DHxH%3D%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7520ed1d911bd2de9b931807c54ffe2739f50bf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,32,237,29,145,27,210,222,155,147,24,7,197,79,254,39,57,245,11,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
