Along the way he debunks alien abduction, faith-healing, and channeling; refutes the arguments that science destroys spirituality, and provides a &quot;baloney detection kit&quot; for thinking through political, social, religious, and other issues.\n\n\nRunning Time: 9:50:52","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08e68bfa64f6df83fa1439905fd5bd1c2d83bfb9","amp;dn":"Carl+Sagan+-+The+Demon-Haunted+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08e68bfa64f6df83fa1439905fd5bd1c2d83bfb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,230,139,250,100,246,223,131,250,20,57,144,95,213,189,28,45,131,191,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
