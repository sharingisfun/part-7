It follows the story of Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe), a young woman from southern England who has to move to the North after her father decides to leave the clergy. The family struggles to adjust itself to the industrial town's customs, especially after meeting the Thorntons, a proud family of cotton mill owners who seem to despise their social inferiors. The story explores the issues of class and gender, as Margaret's sympathy for the town mill workers clashes with her growing attraction to John Thornton (Richard Armitage).\r\n\r\nThe serial is based on the 1855 Victorian novel North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell. It was adapted for television by Sandy Welch and directed by Brian Percival.\r\nNorth and South is a four part adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's love story of Margaret Hale, a middle class southerner who is forced to move to the northern town of Milton.\r\n\r\nFiles contained in download\r\nNorth.and.South.Part1.2004.TV.DVDRip.XviD-SAPHiRE.avi\r\nNorth.and.South.Part2.2004.TV.DVDRip.XviD-SAPHiRE.avi\r\nNorth.and.South.Part3.2004.TV.DVDRip.XviD-SAPHiRE.avi\r\nNorth.and.South.Part4.2004.TV.DVDRip.XviD-SAPHiRE.avi\r\nNorth &amp; South (2004) CD1 - SAPHiRE -.srt\r\nNorth &amp; South (2004) CD2 - SAPHiRE -.srt\r\nNorth &amp; South (2004) CD3 - SAPHiRE -.srt\r\nNorth &amp; South (2004) CD3 - SAPHiRE -.srt\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088583/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\r\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_%26_South_(TV_serial)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f0d0c1a0d13a5d2e7c48ba4297513e6475cafd6","amp;dn":"NORTH+%26amp%3B+SOUTH++2004+UK+BBC+Television+Mini-series+KS49","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f0d0c1a0d13a5d2e7c48ba4297513e6475cafd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,13,12,26,13,19,165,210,231,196,139,164,41,117,19,230,71,92,175,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
