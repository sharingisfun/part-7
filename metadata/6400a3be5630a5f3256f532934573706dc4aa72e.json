Unlike any other film ever produced on the conflict -- &amp;#039;Occupation 101&amp;#039; presents a comprehensive analysis of the facts and hidden truths surrounding the never ending controversy and dispels many of its long-perceived myths and misconceptions.\n\nThe film also details life under Israeli military rule, the role of the United States in the conflict, and the major obstacles that stand in the way of a lasting and viable peace. The roots of the conflict are explained through first-hand on-the-ground experiences from leading Middle East scholars, peace activists, journalists, religious leaders and humanitarian workers whose voices have too often been suppressed in American media outlets.\n\nThe film covers a wide range of topics -- which include -- the first wave of Jewish immigration from Europe in the 1880&amp;#039;s, the 1920 tensions, the 1948 war, the 1967 war, the first Intifada of 1987, the Oslo Peace Process, Settlement expansion, the role of the United States Government, the second Intifada of 2000, the separation barrier and the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as well as many heart wrenching testimonials from victims of this tragedy.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.occupation101.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.occupation101.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English\nGenre: Documentary\nDuration: 01:27:59\nYear: 2006\nVideo Quality: 10/10\nSound Quality: 10/10\nFormat: XVID / AVI\nBitrate: 128 kbps \n\nBuy the original DVD at http://www.occupation101.com/\n\nlogin at: http://www.islamictorrents.net for more seeders.
