There have been many species of human-like creatures in the past. Now, all but Homo sapiens are extinct. If we can understand the past, we may be able to understand why we are the way we are today. And perhaps we can find clues to our future.\nThe incredible story of human evolution comes to life through the latest breakthroughs, interviews with scientists and anthropologists, and computer simulations. Hosted by Walter Cronkite, and filmed on location in Africa, APE MAN is the definitive account of how humans evolved from primates to become the dominant species on earth. From the extinction of the dinosaurs to the invention of fire, from the development of language to the link between furry ancestors and modern man, this vivid journey tells a towering story.\n\nDirector : Peter Nicholson\nProducer : Rod Caird\nProduced by GRANADA TELEVISION for THE ARTS &amp; ENTERTAINMENT NETWORKS\n\n2)  Giant Strides \nOnce humans learned to walk upright, they began to take giant developmental strides away from their animal relatives. They invented tools, which provided the edge in the search for food. The awesome power of fire came next, then the evolutionary grand prize-- the human brain.\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2263 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x544\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.324:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 50:47.120\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 896 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Ape_Man:_The_Story_of_Human_Evolution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Ape_Man:_The_Story_of_Human_Evolution&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e285c57291ea310be4aeb0744018f8f1a90b8675","amp;dn":"Ape+Man+The+Story+of+Human+Evolution+2of4+Giant+Strides+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e285c57291ea310be4aeb0744018f8f1a90b8675","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,133,197,114,145,234,49,11,228,174,176,116,64,24,248,241,169,11,134,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
