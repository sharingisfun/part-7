Readers follow along with the development of each project, implementing and running each application while learning new features along the way. This edition is updated for Django 1.1 and includes a new chapter on unit testing in Django.\n\nWhat youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ll learn\n\n* Capitalize upon the wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“defined and stable framework architecture of Django 1.1 to build web applications faster than ever before.\n* Learn by doing by working through the creation of three realÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“world projects, including a content management system, blog, and social networking site.\n* Build userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“friendly web sites with wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“structured URLs, session tracking, and syndication options.\n* Let Django handle tedious tasks such as database interaction while you focus on building compelling applications.\n\n\nWho is this book for?\n\nWeb developers seeking to use the powerful Django framework to build powerful web sites.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:162bc9f25fda70c66d169497d2c7a45bc8e6c96e","amp;dn":"Practical+Django+Projects%2C+Second+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"162bc9f25fda70c66d169497d2c7a45bc8e6c96e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,43,201,242,95,218,112,198,109,22,148,151,210,199,164,91,200,230,201,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
