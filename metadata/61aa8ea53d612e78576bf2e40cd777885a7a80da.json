If you change drift direction, points are added to Total Points Indicator (located in the top left of the screen) and reset. If points reach every multiple of 2000 again, Drift Combo is increased by 1 again. This works only if you keep drifting without too long interruptions between one drift and the other (less than 1 second), otherwise Drift Combo multiplier will be reset to 1.\nProximity multiplier is increased when you drift with the back of the car near a wall (less than 1.5 meters) proportionally to closeness. You'll notice this bonus with a slow motion effect and a text showing the multiplier factor.\nIf you hit anything you'll lose your partial points and all multipliers.\n\n\nPERMISSIONS REQUIRED\nLocation\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ precise location (GPS and network-based)\nUsed to locate player nationality (shown in the leaderboard).\n\nPhotos/Media/Files\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ modify or delete the contents of your USB storage\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ test access to protected storage\nUsed to save player profile data.\n\nWi-Fi connection information\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ view Wi-Fi connections\nUsed to send player scores to leaderboard server","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61aa8ea53d612e78576bf2e40cd777885a7a80da","amp;dn":"Real+drift+car+raising+v2.3+and+v3.1+MOD+%5BAPK%2BDATA%5D_+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61aa8ea53d612e78576bf2e40cd777885a7a80da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,170,142,165,61,97,46,120,87,107,242,228,12,215,119,136,90,122,128,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
