In World War I many German men lost their lives, and afterwards women's roles expanded, creating aggressive, powerful, sexual beings. Like Marlene Dietrich, Weimar women could wear suits and also retain their attractiveness and femininity. Weimar Berlin was the primary city of European sex culture, and its permissive sensibility allowed women to transgress the usual ideal. These women were allowed to exercise their sexual prerogatives right up until the Third Reich insisted that they return to the role of child-bearer.
