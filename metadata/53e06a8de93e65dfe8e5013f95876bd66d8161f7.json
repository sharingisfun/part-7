Rassias \n\n\n# Pages: 32\n# Publisher: Springer;\n# Year: 2011 edition\n# ISBN-10: 1441904948\n# ISBN-13: 978-1441904942\n\n\nThe book provides a self-contained introduction to classical Number Theory. All the proofs of the individual theorems and the solutions of the exercises are being presented step by step. Some historical remarks are also presented.\n\nThe book will be directed to advanced undergraduate, beginning graduate students as well as to students who prepare for mathematical competitions (ex. Mathematical Olympiads and Putnam Mathematical competition).\n\n\nThis book is designed to introduce some of the most important theorems and results from number theory while testing the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s understanding through carefully selected Olympiad-caliber problems. These problems and their solutions provide the reader with an opportunity to sharpen their skills and to apply the theory. This framework guides the reader to an easy comprehension of some of the jewels of number theory.\n\nThe book is self-contained and rigorously presented. Various aspects will be of interest to graduate and undergraduate students in number theory, advanced high school students and the teachers who train them for mathematics competitions, as well as to scholars who will enjoy learning more about number theory.\n\n\nAuthor\n======\nMichael Th. Rassias has received several awards in mathematical problem solving competitions including two gold medals at the Pan-Hellenic Mathematical Competitions of 2002 and 2003 held in Athens, a silver medal at the Balkan Mathematical Olympiad of 2002 held in Targu Mures, Romania and a silver medal at the 44th International Mathematical Olympiad of 2003 held in Tokyo, Japan.\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53e06a8de93e65dfe8e5013f95876bd66d8161f7","amp;dn":"Problem-Solving+and+Selected+Topics+in+Number+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53e06a8de93e65dfe8e5013f95876bd66d8161f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,224,106,141,233,62,101,223,232,229,1,63,149,135,107,214,109,129,97,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
