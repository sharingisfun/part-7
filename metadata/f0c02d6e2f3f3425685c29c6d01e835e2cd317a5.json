The sound mix here it a bit different from the one heard the last 40 years on various WB issues - the brightness of the original has been toned down, resulting in a mellower feel overall. The instrumentals - especially the drum work - has a snap not heard before. Unfortunately, Taylor's vocals are, as was the custom in those days, more or less &quot;smeared&quot; between the channels, without specific location. That's sad - and sounds a bit odd - because all the instruments can be easily pinpointed in the sound field. If you are looking for a more laid-back approach to this music, you'll be pleased. If you like this music more on the hard rock side, you may not.
