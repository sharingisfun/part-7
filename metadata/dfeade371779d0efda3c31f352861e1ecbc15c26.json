Create ideas, make changes without stopping, and capture everything as you work. If you've used music software before, you're already familiar with one half of Ableton Live. Live's Arrangement View is a familiar working space: time moves from left to right, while tracks are stacked vertically.\n\nBut Live also features the revolutionary Session View: a uniquesketchpad for improvising, playing and performing with musical ideas, without the constraints of the timeline. Freely and independently start and stop any number of audio or MIDI loops - everything stays in sync. Almost everything in Live works in real-time - add, reorder or remove devices, play with Live's flexible track routing and more all without interrupting your creative flow.\n\nAbleton Live 9 new features\n\n* Session automation: In Session View, automation can now be recorded in real time directly within clips. Automation can move together with clips between Arrangement and Session View.\n* Find sounds fast: Live's new browser puts all instruments, effects, samples, and plug-ins in one easy-to-navigate view. Drag and drop folders from anywhere on your computer, search as you type and navigate from the keyboard to find everything quickly.\n* Discover new sounds: Live comes with a large selection (3,500 in the Suite edition) of production-ready sounds, which were carefully crafted with the help of over 40 artists, sound designers and engineers. All sounds feature Macro controls for fast access to their most meaningful, musical parameters.\n* Get your sound right: Live's studio effects have all been reworked for even better sound and usability. The Glue Compressor is a new effect - an authentic model of a legendary 1980s console bus compressor. EQ Eight has an audition mode for isolating frequencies and an expandable spectrum display. The Gate and Compressor effects feature a Gain Reduction view which shows changes in signal level over time.\n* Extract music from samples: Live's new Harmony, Melody and Drums To Midi tools extract natural-feeling MIDI directly from the favourite parts of your music collection. You can also sing, tap a rhythm, play any solo instrument, then use Melody or Drums to MIDI to turn your recordings into MIDI clips that you can edit and reuse with any sound.\n* Edit the details: Transpose, reverse and stretch MIDI notes or warp clip automation and add curves to automation envelopes. New tools and an improved workflow allow fast and flexible editing of musical ideas.\n* Max for Live - now in Suite: The Suite edition of Live 9 comes with Max for Live and its many unique instruments, effects and tools. Max for Live itself includes 24 new devices such as a convolution reverb, new drum synthesizer instruments, MIDI echo as well as reworked versions of classics such as Step Sequencer and Buffer Shuffler 2.\n\nWhat's new in Ableton Live 9.1.3:\n\nImprovements and feature changes\n-Added control surface support for AKAI MPK225, MPK249, MPK261.\n\nBugfixes:\n-Fixed an issue which caused CPU spikes when moving a MIDI note in a track containing certain Ableton devices with automated parameters while the transport is not playing.\n-Fixed CPU overloads and audio artifacts which might occur when moving MIDI notes in the MIDI editor, if the track contained certain third-party VST plug-ins.\n-Fixed a bug that caused the active Control Scripts to be loaded again when activating an additional Control Surface.\n-Enabling multiple tracks for recording and then triggering the Session Record button from the APC40 MKII would only record into the currently selected track instead of all armed tracks.\n-Fixed a bug which prevented Max for Live devices from grabbing the APC40 Clip Matrix.\n-Manual mappings for the APC40Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Device Bank buttons would not work anymore after pressing the deviceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Shift button.\n-Fixed an issue on the Mackie Control Pro where the display would not show the parameter's values correctly, after previously enabling the level meters.\n-Fixed a graphical glitch which could occur when changing an Arrangement track's vertical zoom level via the Mackie Control or a Max for Live device. Under certain conditions, this could also lead to a crash.\n-Importing a Session View clip containing automation for a Max for Live device into another Live Set would create automation breakpoints in the Arrangement View.\n-When loop is activated in the Arrangement View, MIDI sustain messages and other CC# messages would not be recorded reliably after the first loop iteration.\n-Live would allocate an unusually high amount of RAM when rendering video with the 64-bit version on OSX.\n-When configuring plug-in parameters, some sliders in Live's plug-in panel would not match the position of the respective parameter in the plug-in GUI.\n-After installing a newly purchased Pack, Live would show an error message and the Pack couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be used until Live was authorized manually again.\n-Text in deactivated clips was not readable with certain skins.\n-Fixed a crash that occurred when closing the plug-in window of a UAD Audio Unit by pressing the [ESC] key.\n-Fixed a crash which might occur when renaming a Drum Rack pad while triggering another pad.\n-Live could crash under certain conditions when running as a ReWire slave and creating a new Live Set without saving the previous Set.\n-Under certain circumstances, Live would delete send automation or modulation envelopes from clips when exporting clips or tracks to the browser. Additionally, Live could crash when using the undo feature after such an export operation.\n\nChanges for Push:\n-Certain Max for Live devices which accessed the Push Touch Strip would not work properly.\n\nSystem requirements\n\n- Windows XP (64 bit), Windows Vista (64 bit), Windows 7 (64 bit) or Windows 8 (64 bit)\n- Multicore processor\n- 2 GB RAM\n-1024x768 display\n-3GB free disk space\n\nLanguages : English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.ableton.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.ableton.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfeade371779d0efda3c31f352861e1ecbc15c26","amp;dn":"Ableton+Live+9+Suite+9.1.3+%28Win+64+bit%29+%28patch+IO%29+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfeade371779d0efda3c31f352861e1ecbc15c26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,234,222,55,23,121,208,239,218,60,49,243,82,134,30,30,203,193,92,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
