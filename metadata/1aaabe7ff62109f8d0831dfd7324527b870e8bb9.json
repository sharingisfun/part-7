It's a new year and another series of Trust Me; I'm a Doctor, ready to help you shake off the festive excesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Part 1 \r\nIn this special New Year programme, Dr Saleyha Ahsan oversees a world-first experiment to see how we can burn more fat - without doing any more exercise. Michael Mosley gives a cheat's guide to a better body, with results that astonish the scientists. Dr Chris van Tulleken puts protein shakes to the test, and surgeon Gabriel Weston meets a woman who has sight restored for the first time in 16 years, thanks to a bionic eye.\r\n\r\n2)  Part 2 \r\nDr Chris van Tulleken runs a groundbreaking experiment with the University of Surrey to see whether simply changing our mealtimes can help us all lose weight, whilst Gabriel Weston looks at whether diet products could actually be making us put it on! Dr Saleyha Ahsan investigates the chemicals sprayed around our houses, and Michael Mosley gets to the truth about alcohol: can it be good for our health? Plus the story of a 12-year-old girl undergoing a new treatment for peanut allergy, and how to treat someone having an allergic reaction.\r\n\r\n3)  Part 3 \r\nThe doctors are in Glasgow, using a cutting-edge technique to discover whether olive oil really is good for us. Dr Chris van Tulleken gets to the truth about whether beards are unhygienic, Michael Mosley interrogates the experts about whether meat is bad for us, and Dr Saleyha Ahsan hears from the survivors of sepsis on how we can all spot the signs of this little-known killer.\r\n\r\n4)  Part 4 \r\nIn the final episode of the series, the doctors reveal the secrets to how we can all stick to those health resolutions we made at New Year, but are already struggling to keep. Surgeon Gabriel Weston experiments with a herbal supplement said to help us drink less alcohol, Dr Chris van Tulleken reveals some unusual ways to get a better night's sleep, and Michael Mosley uncovers the secret of staying motivated. Meanwhile, Dr Saleyha Ahsan tests some revolutionary new science that could help us all easily lose weight and be healthier.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/78/Trust-Me-I-m-a-Doctor-Series-4-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e7/Trust-Me-I-m-a-Doctor-Series-4-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/69/Trust-Me-I-m-a-Doctor-Series-4-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/03/Trust-Me-I-m-a-Doctor-Series-4-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/de/Trust-Me-I-m-a-Doctor-Series-4-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b1/Trust-Me-I-m-a-Doctor-Series-4-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Trust-Me-I-m-a-Doctor-Series-4-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/64/Trust-Me-I-m-a-Doctor-Series-4-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ab/Trust-Me-I-m-a-Doctor-Series-4-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/45/Trust-Me-I-m-a-Doctor-Series-4-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2f/Trust-Me-I-m-a-Doctor-Series-4-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/38/Trust-Me-I-m-a-Doctor-Series-4-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 2995 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 4\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nOnly Parts 1- 3: Merged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04j9gny\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Trust%20Me%2C%20I%27m%20a%20Doctor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aaabe7ff62109f8d0831dfd7324527b870e8bb9","amp;dn":"BBC+Trust+Me+Im+a+Doctor+Series+4+3of4+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGrou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aaabe7ff62109f8d0831dfd7324527b870e8bb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,170,190,127,246,33,9,248,208,131,29,253,115,36,82,123,135,14,139,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
