He later moves to an orphanage because Lolotta passes away.\n\nThe film moves forward to when he's eighteen years of age and TotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² (Francesco Golisano) leaves the orphanage and begins to live in a shantytown in Milan.\n\nTotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â²'s organizational skills, learned at the orphanage and from Lolotta, brings structure to the colony and brings a sense of small happiness and well being among the depressed folk.\n\nWhen TotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² is given a magic dove by the ghost of his adoptive mother, he uses its powers to grant wishes to those who ask. The dove, however, is taken back by two angels who object to a mortal having possession of it.\n\nThe land where TotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â²'s and his friends live is taken over by capitalists after oil is found there and they're all taken away to prison in horse-drawn paddy wagons. On the way to prison, however, a dove is returned to TotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² and his wish for the freedom of his friends is granted. In a historical cinematic scene they escape into the sky, arguably to heaven, on brooms pinched from street sweepers in a town square.\n\nAwards ................:\n    * Cannes Film Festival: Grand Prize of the Festival, Vittorio De Sica; 1951.\n    * New York Film Critics Circle Awards: NYFCC Award; Best Foreign Language Film, Italy; 1951.\n    * National Board of Review: National Board of Review Awards 1951, Best Foreign Films; 1951.\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
