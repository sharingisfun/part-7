Hard Life\n...\n\nAmg Review:\nThe fourth Bonnie 'Prince' Billy record in six years finds Will Oldham relaxing into a beautiful groove; similar to 2001's Ease Down the Road, Master and Everyone is quite melodic compared to his Palace or self-titled releases, with less of the dire apocalyptic imagery and more reflections from his literate, anti-romantic backwoodsman. Like most of Oldham's recordings, this one rewards close attention, which reveals recording ambience ranging from creaking wood to a soft patting on the floor (a foot keeping time), and, of course, Oldham's half-resigned, half-plaintive croon. Little gets in the way of these songs. Circular lines from an acoustic guitar demarcate the choruses, a cello adds a bit of emotional warmth to one song, and a few others have the wheezing keys of what sounds like a pump organ. Fortunately, the songs stand up to the examination. &quot;The Way&quot; (&quot;Love me the way I love you&quot;) is very nearly sweet, stranded between desperation and hope. Elsewhere Oldham is a true fatalist, resigning himself to the inevitable power of love to ruin his life and using the creepiest of old-timey metaphors to get his point across. On the title song, he explains the situation &quot;You tell me there are other fish in the sea, and another gathers roses for me/On this we will agree&quot;), then uses the chorus to illustrate his worst fear: &quot;I'm now free, master and everyone/Servant of all and servant to none&quot;. &quot;Wolf Among Wolves&quot; is especially eerie, with the merest whisper of feedbacked guitar and a wordless vocal punctuating the puzzled lyrics, &quot;Why can't I be loved as what I am?/A wolf among wolves, and not as a man among men&quot;. One of the few guests on Master and Everyone is Marty Slayton, who contributes duet vocals to a pair of songs, a surprisingly close crossover to the folk crowd sparked by the success of O Brother, Where Art Thou? Mostly, though, Oldham concentrates on crafting unremittingly introspective and confessional material in a spare, old-timey format. As sometimes happens on the recordings of his kindred spirit Cat Power, however, such unstinting uniformity can be a curse as well as a blessing.\n\nFÃƒÂ¶r mer bra lo-fi, besÃƒÂ¶k tvÃƒÂ¥enigheten pÃƒÂ¥ www.lofi.se \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d93e2d68fe4e377da4169796b6b1b7ee15c69c7c","amp;dn":"Bonnie+%5C%27Prince%5C%27+Billy+-+Master+and+Everyone+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d93e2d68fe4e377da4169796b6b1b7ee15c69c7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,62,45,104,254,78,55,125,164,22,151,150,182,177,183,238,21,198,156,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
