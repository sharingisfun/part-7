The Archies made no pretense of being a real band in the first place ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ their music, including the smash hit &quot;Sugar, Sugar,&quot; was &quot;performed&quot; by the animated TV cartoon characters spun off from Archie comics. In reality, of course, they were a studio concoction made up of hired professionals (most notably lead singer Ron Dante), but in this case, they weren't technically faceless.\n\nThe Archies were created by promoter Don Kirshner, who was coming off of a major success as the creator of the Monkees. \n\n\nTracklisting:\n\nBang Shang A Lang\nBicycles Roller Skates\nDon't Need No Bad Girl\nDon't Touch My Guitar\nEasy Guy\nFeelin' So Good\nGet On The Line\nHot Dogs\nInside Out, Upside Down\nJingle Jangle\nKissin'\nLittle Green Jacket\nMelody Hill\nOver And Over\nRock 'n' Roll Music\nSugar Sugar\nThis Is Love\nThis Is The Night\nWaldo P.
