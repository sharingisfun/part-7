Not for the timid, these positions challenge flexibility and stamina and will get readers head over heels--as well as sideways and upside down--to facilitate deep penetration, hit multiple hot spots, and yield amazing orgasms.\n\n- Stairway to Heaven: A sexy intercourse position where she stands one step above him on the staircase. He enters her from behind and lifts and folds her legs back and around his waist giving her amazing G-spot stimulation.\n\n- Over the Rainbow: His palms and feet are flat on the floor with his body arched. She is draped over his body, her back following the same bend as his, her feet resting on his chest. From the side, their bodies form an arc-shaped rainbow. The rush of blood to the head makes this demanding position even more thrilling and intense.\n\n- The Pretzel: He stands upright, and penetrates her in rear-entry position. He supports her waist while she pushes her arms back and raises her legs until she can grasp her ankles with her hands, as in the bow yoga position. Once sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in place, the grip of her thighs should be enough to support her. He can keep one arm wrapped around her waist for added support; the other is free to stimulate her breasts and clitoris. The ultra-tight penetration means more stimulation for him and an ultimate filled-up feeling for her.\n\nAbout the Author\nEmily Dubberley is a British author and journalist specialising in sex and relationships.
