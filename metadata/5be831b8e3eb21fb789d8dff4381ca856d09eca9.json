Both members alternate as lead vocalists and play rhythm guitar. Rich was a founding member of the country music band Lonestar and later a solo artist for BNA Records, while Kenny was formerly a solo artist on Hollywood Records.\n\nBig &amp; Rich's first studio album, Horse of a Different Color, was released in 2004. This album produced four straight Top 40 country hits, including the #11 &quot;Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)&quot;, as well as collaborations with Cowboy Troy, Gretchen Wilson and Martina McBride. Comin' to Your City, released in November 2005, added another top-20 single, the Vietnam War-inspired &quot;8th of November,&quot; as well as two other songs that reached the top 40. Joining the duo on this album were Cowboy Troy, Wilson, and Kris Kristofferson. Big &amp; Rich's third studio album, Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace, produced the duo's first Number One single, &quot;Lost in This Moment.&quot; After this album, both members went on hiatus and released solo albums, also charting solo singles in the country top 40: Rich with &quot;Shuttin' Detroit Down&quot; and Kenny with &quot;Long After I'm Gone.

Records and it contains the hit singles &quot;Wild West Show&quot;, &quot;Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)&quot;, &quot;Holy Water&quot;, and &quot;Big Time&quot;. Respectively, these reached #21, #11, #15, and #20 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. The album was certified 3ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ Multi-Platinum by the RIAA for shipments of three million copies. This album was released in several colors, including blue, red, and gold.\n\n\nHorse of a Different color features several guest musicians, primarily members of the MuzikMafia, the collaborative singer-songwriter group that Big &amp; Rich founded. Country rap artist Cowboy Troy is featured on the lead-off track &quot;Rollin' (The Ballad of Big &amp; Rich)&quot;, and makes an uncredited guest appearance at the end of &quot;Kick My Ass&quot;. Gretchen Wilson provides background vocals on &quot;Saved&quot;, and Jon Nicholson on &quot;Love Train&quot;. The only guest musician who is not a MuzikMafia member is Martina McBride, who provides backing vocals on the final track, &quot;Live This Life&quot;. Big Kenny and John Rich, who comprise the duo, co-wrote all the tracks on the album, and co-produced it with Paul Worley.\n\nFour singles were released from this album. Lead-off single &quot;Wild West Show&quot; peaked at #21 on the Billboard country charts in early 2004. Following it was &quot;Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)&quot;, which peaked at #11 and was certified platinum by the RIAA as a single. The third single release, the #15 &quot;Holy Water&quot;, was inspired by Big Kenny's and John Rich's sisters, both victims of domestic abuse. &quot;Big Time&quot; was the final single, reaching #20 in mid-2005.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Rollin' (The Ballad of Big &amp; Rich)&quot; (Big Kenny, John Rich, Cowboy Troy) - 4:40 \n\tfeat.
