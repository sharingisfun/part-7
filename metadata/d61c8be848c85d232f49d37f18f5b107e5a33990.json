For thirty-three years Srivatsa Ramaswami studied with the legendary T. Krishnamacharya, the most influential figure in the field of yoga in the past hundred years and teacher of B. K. S. Iyengar, Pattabhi Jois, and T. K. V. Desikachar. Since that time he has developed KrishnamacharyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teaching into what may be the most highly evolved program available for making yoga a way of life, rather than simply a routine. In thought-provoking discussions and hundreds of photographs, Ramaswami lays out a lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of yoga teachings, including principles for right living, postures, breathing practices, meditation practices, and mental disciplines. Key to RamaswamiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teaching is the focus on adapting yoga to individual needs and to different stages of life. During the early part of life, learning yoga as a physical art form is most beneficial for the self-confidence and discipline it instills. In middle age, yoga should focus on physical therapy and maintaining optimum health as far into life as possible. In the last stages of life, the practitioner will be ready to focus on the ultimate goal--true understanding of the philosophy behind yoga and the realization of truth. SRIVATSA RAMASWAMI has taught yoga in universities, hospitals, and schools in India for more than twenty years. A familiar figure on Indian radio and television, he now teaches workshops throughout the United States as well.\n\n\nBy Srivatsa Ramaswami\nPublished by Inner Traditions in 2001\nEPUB, Retail, 272 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d61c8be848c85d232f49d37f18f5b107e5a33990","amp;dn":"Yoga+for+the+Three+Stages+of+Life+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29+%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d61c8be848c85d232f49d37f18f5b107e5a33990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,28,139,232,72,200,93,35,47,73,211,127,24,245,177,7,229,163,57,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
