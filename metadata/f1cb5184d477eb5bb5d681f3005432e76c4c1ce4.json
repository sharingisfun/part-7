They are best known for the songs &quot;Letter from America&quot;, &quot;I'm On My Way&quot;, and &quot;I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot;.\n\n\nThe twins were brought up in Auchtermuchty, Fife. After several punk rock bands at school they formed The Proclaimers in 1983.\n\nThe pair came to public attention when an Inverness fan sent their demo to the British band The Housemartins, who were impressed enough to invite the Proclaimers on their 1986 UK tour. The exposure of the tour won them a January 1987 appearance on UK popular music programme The Tube on Channel Four; [1] Letter from America peaked at number 3 in the UK singles chart, while the album This is the Story went gold. The follow-up album Sunshine on Leith featured I'm Gonna Be... (UK number 11) and I'm On My Way (UK number 43). They had a big hit with the EP/single King of the Road, which reached number 9 in the UK in 1990.\n\nThe brothers are famous fans of Hibernian Football Club, and &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot; has become a theme song for the club, being played at every home match. They are also well-known supporters of Scottish independence and have at various stages of their lives been activists for the Scottish National Party, expressing such views on their promotional tour of Britain in March 2007,[2] although the following month, Charlie Reid announced that he had switched his allegiance to the Scottish Socialist Party in protest at the Scottish National Party's receipt of funding from big business [3]. Many of their songs reflect their political views, such as Letter from America and Cap in Hand. On 16 May 2006, the twins announced their participation in a campaign to free a fellow Scot, Kenny Richey, from his death row sentence in Ohio, United States, including an appearance at a charity concert.[4]\n\nI'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) has become a major Scottish anthem, played at Scottish national football matches, Scottish pubs, and other traditional Scottish events across the world.\n\nAs of May 2006 I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) had remained in the iTunes download chart since December 2004. The 1988 album Sunshine on Leith sold over 25,000 copies in 2005.\n\nIn March 2007 they recorded a new version of I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) with television comedy characters Andy Pipkin (played by Matt Lucas) and Brian Potter (Peter Kay) for the Comic Relief charity. A long list of celebrities were featured in the music video for this new version, including David Bellamy, Rod, Jane and Freddy, Paul O'Grady, David Tennant, Frank Sidebottom and many more. This new version of the song reached No. 1 in the UK singles chart.\n\nIn June 2007 their former manager Kai Davidson was killed by a fall at the age of 44 with his death being ruled a probable suicide.[broken citation][5]\n\nOn 31 December 2007 (Hogmanay) they sold out a concert in Stirling Castle to celebrate the New Year.\n\nThe band have been announced as the touring partners of The B-52's on their Funplex tour, which will take in Australia this November alongside Mental as Anything.\n\nThe Proclaimers are celebrity patrons of the Association for International Cancer Research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunshine on Leith 1988\n\n\nSunshine on Leith is The Proclaimers second and most well known album, released in August 1988. The album had three singles, including the title track, &quot;I'm On My Way,&quot; and &quot;I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles),&quot; which also became a hit following its inclusion on the soundtrack to Benny &amp; Joon five years later in 1993. It is about their birthplace, Leith, and the titular track Sunshine on Leith is played by Hibernian F.C. at the beginning of matches.\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39 \n2.\t&quot;Cap in Hand&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24 \n3.\t&quot;Then I Met You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50 \n4.\t&quot;My Old Friend the Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06 \n5.\t&quot;Sean&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23 \n6.\t&quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:16 \n7.\t&quot;Come on Nature&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34 \n8.\t&quot;I'm on My Way&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45 \n9.\t&quot;What Do You Do?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38 \n10.\t&quot;It's Saturday Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24 \n11.\t&quot;Teardrops&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:32 \n12.\t&quot;Oh Jean&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:55 \n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1cb5184d477eb5bb5d681f3005432e76c4c1ce4","amp;dn":"The+Proclaimers+-+Sunshine+on+Leith+1988+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1cb5184d477eb5bb5d681f3005432e76c4c1ce4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,203,81,132,212,119,235,91,181,214,129,243,0,84,50,231,108,76,28,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
