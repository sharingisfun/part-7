Described by James Kirkup as &quot;the most reclusive author of the 20th century,&quot; there are only two known photographs of Blanchot.  His work challenged the boundaries between the literary and the philosophical, and his theories on the relationship between the writer, language, literature and philosophy influenced a generation of post-modern and post-structuralist thinkers such as Foucault and Derrida. \n\nBlanchot draws heavily from Franz Kafka, and his fictional work (like his theoretical work) is shot through with an engagement with Kafka's writing.  His later work in particular is influenced by Levinasian ethics and the question of responsibility to the Other.  On the other hand, Blanchot's own literary works, like the famous THOMAS THE OBSCURE,  heavily influenced Levinas's and Bataille's ideas about the possibility that our vision of reality is blurred because of the use of words.\n\nIn his final years, Blanchot communicated with very few people, preferring to refer to himself as &quot;already dead&quot; and his publications as &quot;posthumous.&quot;  His friendship with Derrida remained strong, however, and the two communicated until BlanchotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death in 2003.  Derrida delivered the eulogy. \n\n\nThe following books (and some unlisted journal articles) are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* AMINADAB (University of Nebraska, 2002).
