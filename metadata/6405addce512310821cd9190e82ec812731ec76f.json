The laotong, Snow Flower, introduces herself by sending Lily a silk fan on which sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s painted a poem in nu shu, a unique language that Chinese women created in order to communicate in secret, away from the influence of men. As the years pass, Lily and Snow Flower send messages on fans, compose stories on handkerchiefs, reaching out of isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments. Together, they endure the agony of foot-binding, and reflect upon their arranged marriages, shared loneliness, and the joys and tragedies of motherhood. The two find solace, developing a bond that keeps their spirits alive. But when a misunderstanding arises, their deep friendship suddenly threatens to tear apart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6405addce512310821cd9190e82ec812731ec76f","amp;dn":"Snow+Flower+and+the+Secret+Fan+-+Lisa+See.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6405addce512310821cd9190e82ec812731ec76f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,5,173,220,229,18,49,8,33,205,145,144,232,46,200,18,115,30,199,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
