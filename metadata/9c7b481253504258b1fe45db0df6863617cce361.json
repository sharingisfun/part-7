The six volumes reflect the geographical distribution and the cultural, social and religious diversity of the peoples of the Muslim world. Four volumes cover historical developments and two are devoted to themes that cut across geographical and chronological divisions, ranging from social, political and economic relations to the arts, literature and learning. Each volume's introduction sets the scene for the ensuing chapters and examines relationships with adjacent civilizations. Written by a team combining established authorities and rising scholars in the field, this will be the standard reference for students, scholars and all those with enquiring minds for years to come.\n\n\nTitle: The New Cambridge History of Islam (6-Volume Set)\nAuthor(s): Composite\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press\nYear: 2010\nFormat: PDF\n\nMore info on the books below:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Cambridge-History-Islam-Volume/dp/052151536X%3FSubscriptionId%3D1NNRF7QZ418V218YP1R2%26tag%3Dbf-in-all-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D052151536X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Cambridge-History-Islam-Volume/dp/052151536X%3FSubscriptionId%3D1NNRF7QZ418V218YP1R2%26tag%3Dbf-in-all-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D052151536X&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
