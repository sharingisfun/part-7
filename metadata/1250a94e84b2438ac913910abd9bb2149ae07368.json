Many of his songs were translated into Hebrew and performed by the country's leading singers. \nYaron Enosh, an Israel Radio broadcaster who often plays Greek music on his programs, described the singer's ability to combine joy with sorrow: &quot;This is the task of music: to touch the entire range of feelings...Kazantzidis could do this; he played on all the strings.&quot; \n\nKazantzidis died of a brain tumor on September 14, 2001. \nHis death was an emotional event for Greece, as attested to by the many obituaries in appreciation of his life and work. Kazantzidis was given a national funeral through the streets of Elefsina (26 km from Athens) which was broadcast live on Greek television. \nHis music was also beloved by the Greek diaspora all over the world, capturing their feelings in the difficult post-war period.\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Kazantzidis was the voice of the people, of the weary, the exploited, the betrayed. And the voice of the refugee and the emigre, too.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nStelios Kazantzidis sings Vassilis Tsitsanis\n\nA hallmark in his career ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and an event of great importance for the musical scene of post-war Greece ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was his cooperation with composer Vassilis Tsitsanis. \nIt started in 1956 and resulted in Kazantzidis reinterpreting some of Tsitsanis old songs. Kazantzidis, thus, sung and popularized such rebetiko classics as &quot;Synnefiasmeni Kyriaki&quot;, &quot;Mpakse tsifliki&quot; and &quot;Ta Kavourakia&quot;. \nThese songs, and many others, previously unknown to the wide public suddenly became cherished and sought-after.
