In his first starring role (it had previously been offered to John Garfield and Dick Powell), Robert Mitchum plays Jeff Bailey, the friendly but secretive proprietor of a mountain-village gas station. As Jeff's worshipful deaf-mute attendant (Dick Moore) looks on in curious fascination, an unsavory character named Joe (Paul Valentine) pulls up to the station, obviously looking for the owner. Jeff is all too aware of Joe's identity; he's been dreading this moment for quite some time, knowing full well that it will mean the end of his semi-idyllic existence, not to mention his engagement to local girl Ann (Virginia Huston). In a lengthy flashback, the audience is apprised of the reasons behind Jeff's discomfort - and thus begins a tale of treachery, betrayal and intrigue that extends into the present day and turns Jeff's life upside down. Out of the Past was remade in 1984 as Against All Odds, with Jane Greer cast as the mother of her original character. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039689/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039689/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nJacques Tourneur\n\n\n\n\tRobert Mitchum\t... \tJeff Bailey\n\tJane Greer\t... \tKathie Moffat\n\n\tKirk Douglas\t... \tWhit Sterling\n\n\tRhonda Fleming\t... \tMeta Carson\n\tRichard Webb\t... \tJim\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:36:44\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480 4:3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1963 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,27 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : ATSC/A-52 Dolby AC3\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3079631a89fd2064db65f14efe06b536978d3573","amp;dn":"Out+of+the+Past+%281947%29+Robert+Mitchum+Eng+%28multisubs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3079631a89fd2064db65f14efe06b536978d3573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,121,99,26,137,253,32,100,219,101,241,78,254,6,181,54,151,141,53,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
