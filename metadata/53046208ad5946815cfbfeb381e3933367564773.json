However, in the end the struggle was worth it because after constructing an MP3 version of the original without the lead-in, I was left with a video of just the right length and with ONE PRECIOUS KEY FRAME that allowed me to multiplex back-in the original AC-3 Dolby audio stream (which is the default stream for the AVI included here).\n\nVideo details:\n--------------\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : JS Bach's Goldberg Variations [Glenn Gould, 1981].XviD.AC3 (2ch.
