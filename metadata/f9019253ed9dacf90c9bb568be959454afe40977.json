Adina will never garner the mainstream appeal that her peers like Britney Spear or Janet Jackson has but there is something more real about Adina and sincere despite her &quot;in your face&quot; sexuality (not to mention this woman can actually sing)! Before you get her new CD &quot;Second Coming&quot;, get this. In fact, I'd recommend that you buy both because you'll see how she started and how she's progressed since then. \nAs for this album itself, it was a very good debut. True, the only real hit from this CD was &quot;Freak Like Me&quot; but other recommended songs would be &quot;Its All About You&quot;, &quot;My Up And Down&quot; and &quot;If We Make Love Tonight.&quot; Really, there isn't a bad song on the CD.\n\nI also called her a singing hardcore legend but to be honest, she really isn't that edgy. She's more enticing than raunchy. She's more likely to attract you rather than scare you off. Plus, this came out in 1995, her new album &quot;The Second Coming&quot; just came out this month and this is 2004 and people were still talking about her! To me, if people are still talking about you years after your first CD, you've done something right! Of all the Pop/R&amp;B/Hip-Hop CD's out there right now, I'd recommend this one and her new one together. And, if you are lucky, find her unreleased CD &quot;Welcome To Fantasy Island&quot; which never got play over in the U.S. but was popular on the streets and overseas.\n\nTHIS IS AN ADULT PARTY HERE! WHILE THERE IS NO PARENTAL LABEL, THIS CD ISN'T FOR KIDS! It's for LOVERS, BABY MAKERS AND FREAKS ONLY! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9019253ed9dacf90c9bb568be959454afe40977","amp;dn":"Adina+Howard+-+Do+You+Wanna+Ride","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9019253ed9dacf90c9bb568be959454afe40977","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,1,146,83,237,157,172,249,12,155,181,104,190,149,148,84,175,228,9,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
