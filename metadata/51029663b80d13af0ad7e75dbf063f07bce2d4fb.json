Richard Hornberger (February 1, 1924 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ November 4, 1997) was an American writer and surgeon, born in Trenton, New Jersey, who wrote under the pseudonym Richard Hooker. His most famous work was his novel MASH (1968), based on his experiences during the Korean War and written in collaboration with W. C. Heinz. It was later used as the basis for a critically and commercially successful movie (1970) and television series (1972Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1983). His experiences at the 8055th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital were the background for his novel MASH (1968), which he worked on for eleven years. A series of books were published under Hooker's name but ghostwritten by William E. Butterworth. \n\n01: M*A*S*H : A Novel About Three Army Doctors (Published: 1968)\nBefore the movie, this is the novel that gave life to Hawkeye Pierce, Trapper John, Hot Lips Houlihan, Frank Burns, Radar O'Reilly, and the rest of the gang that made the 4077th M*A*S*H like no other place in Korea or on earth. The doctors who worked in the Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals (M*A*S*H) during the Korean War were well trained but, like most soldiers sent to fight a war, too young for the job. In the words of the author, &quot;a few flipped their lids, but most of them just raised hell, in a variety of ways and degrees.&quot; For fans of the movie and the series alike, here is the original version of that perfectly corrupt football game, those martini-laced mornings and sexual escapades, and that unforgettable foray into assisted if incompleted suicide--all as funny and poignant now as they were before they became a part of America's culture and heart.\n\n02: M*A*S*H Goes to Maine (Published: Feb 1972)\n&quot;M*A*S*H Goes to Maine&quot; is Richard Hooker's hilarious sequel to his classic book &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and, for once, the sequel is better! Living a quiet life in Maine after the Korean War, doctors &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce, &quot;Duke&quot; Forrest and &quot;Trapper John&quot; McIntyre are at it again, trying to establish a medical hospital while fighting the snobbiest doctors in America. Funny and very relaxing, you'll love &quot;M*A*S*H Goes to Maine&quot;.\n\n03: M*A*S*H Goes to New Orleans (Published: Jan 1975)\nFurther misadventures of M*A*S*H.\n\n04: M*A*S*H Goes to Paris (Published: Jan 1975)\nFurther misadventures of M*A*S*H.\n\n05: M*A*S*H Goes to London (Published: Jun 1975)\nFurther misadventures of M*A*S*H.\n\n06: M*A*S*H Goes to Las Vegas (Published: Dec 1975)\nThe madcap medics invade Sin City!\n\n07: M*A*S*H Goes to Morocco (Published: Jan 1976)\nThe madcap medics are at it again!\n\n08: M*A*S*H Goes to Hollywood (Published: Apr 1976)\nMore zany adventures of M*A*S*H.\n\n09: M*A*S*H Goes to Vienna (Published: Jun 1976)\nThe antic medics invade the citadel of Strauss and Wiener Schnitzel.\n\n10: M*A*S*H Goes to Miami (Published: Sep 1976)\nThose irrepressible practioners of the cutting art invade unwary Miami.\n\n11: M*A*S*H Goes to San Francisco (Published: Nov 1976)\nThe madcap medics run amuck in the Bay City!\n\n12: M*A*S*H Goes to Texas (Published: Mar 1977)\nThe merry medics stamped through the Lone Star State!\n\n13: M*A*S*H Goes to Montreal (Published: Jun 1977)\nSpirited nuptials north of the border!\n\n14: M*A*S*H Goes to Moscow (Published: Sep 1977)\nAnd war goes to piences in Red Square!\n\n15: M*A*S*H Mania (Published: Dec 1977)\nTHE MEN OF THE SWAMP ARE BACK... Alive and well in Spruce Harbor, Maine, the hometown of Hawkeye Pierce. He and his wacky pals of the M*A*S*H 4077th may be growing older, but they sure haven't grown up! Who else would connive to send a forty-year-old lobsterman to medical school - on a football scholarship? Or have a bear and an eighty-year-old physician tried for rape? Or maneuver a prostitute named Graveyard Alice into bed with a bird - even if he is the Greatest Black-Headed Grosbeak of Them All? They did it all - and plenty more - and the result, well ... is the town of Spruce Harbor still standing?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51029663b80d13af0ad7e75dbf063f07bce2d4fb","amp;dn":"M%2AA%2AS%2AH+Series+by+Richard+Hooker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51029663b80d13af0ad7e75dbf063f07bce2d4fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,2,150,99,184,13,19,175,10,215,231,93,191,6,63,7,188,226,212,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
