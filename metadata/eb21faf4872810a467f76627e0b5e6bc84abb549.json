He transformed mainstream philosophy by defining its central task as asking the 'question of being'. His thought has contributed to the turn to hermeneutics and to postmodernism and poststructuralism. Moreover, the disclosure of his deep involvement in Nazism has provoked much debate about the relation of philosophy to politics. This edition brings to the fore other works, as well as alternative approaches to scholarship. The essays cover topics such as Heidegger's conception of phenomenology, his relation to Kant and Husserl, his account of truth, and his stand on the realism/anti-realism debate. This edition includes a new preface by the editor, revised versions of several essays from the first edition, and an exhaustive bibliography, providing guidance for both newcomers to Heidegger's work and established scholars ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb21faf4872810a467f76627e0b5e6bc84abb549","amp;dn":"The+Cambridge+Companion+to+Heidegger+%5BText-Book%5D+PDF_%28K-Slender%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb21faf4872810a467f76627e0b5e6bc84abb549","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,33,250,244,135,40,16,164,103,247,102,39,224,181,230,188,132,171,181,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
