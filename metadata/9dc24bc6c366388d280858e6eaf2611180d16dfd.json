Animated DVDs introduce a stimulating menagerie of characters who teach French, Spanish, Italian, Chinese or German. Youngsters watch, sing, laugh, and interact with other kids, a funny professor, language-building songs, and lively classroom lessons. And because children are emotionally engaged in a language immersion setting, they really learn. Great for toddlers, preschoolers, and K-6.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dc24bc6c366388d280858e6eaf2611180d16dfd","amp;dn":"Watch+%26+Learn+French+with+Professor+Toto+part+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dc24bc6c366388d280858e6eaf2611180d16dfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,194,75,198,195,102,56,141,40,8,88,230,234,242,97,17,128,209,109,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
