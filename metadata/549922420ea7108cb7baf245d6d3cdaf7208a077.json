Manageable for two-semester courses, the text covers grammar in a logical sequence, leaving the subjunctive and passive voices to the last two chapters. Each chapter contains many function-based activities that focus on specific emotional expressions, such as showing skepticism or sympathy, signaling a lack of understanding, and giving positive and negative responses. Students are introduced to contemporary life and culture in German-Speaking countries through a cast of recurring characters who appear in the Bausteine fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼r GesprÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤che (dialogues) and in some readings and exercises.\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 461 pages\n# Publisher: Heinle; 9 edition (February 17, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0547180586\n# ISBN-13: 978-0547180588","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:549922420ea7108cb7baf245d6d3cdaf7208a077","amp;dn":"Deutsch+heute%3A+Introductory+German%2C9th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"549922420ea7108cb7baf245d6d3cdaf7208a077","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,153,34,66,14,167,16,140,183,186,242,69,214,211,205,175,114,8,160,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
