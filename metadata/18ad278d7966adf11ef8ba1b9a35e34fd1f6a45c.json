He was also a prolific letter writer. \n\nThe letters reveal that Nelson was a very different and more complex man than the hero that Britain created after his death. Using Nelson's letters this drama documentary exposes Nelson's skilful and manipulative use of PR to advance his career, and shows how he was careful in his praise of his rivals - in case they threatened his own prospects. \n\nAnd the letters reveal how his passionate love affair with Emma Hamilton changed his life forever. \n\n\nHighly regarded RSC actor Jonathan Slinger portrays Nelson.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b054v8dl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b054v8dl&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n \n\n ============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n \n [b]\n\nNelson In His Own Words - (1x60 Mins) \n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Nelson In His Own Words.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 700 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 29s\nTotal bitrate               : 1 645 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 29s\nBitrate                     : 1 446 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.193\nStream size                 : 615 MB (88%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 29s\nBitrate mode                : Constant\nBitrate                     : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 81.7 MB (12%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave preload          : 504 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 18.6 -b 192","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18ad278d7966adf11ef8ba1b9a35e34fd1f6a45c","amp;dn":"Nelson+In+His+Own+Words+-+History+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18ad278d7966adf11ef8ba1b9a35e34fd1f6a45c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,173,39,141,121,102,173,241,30,248,186,27,154,53,227,79,209,246,164,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
