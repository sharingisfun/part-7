Praeger | 1969 | ISBN: N/A | English | 292 pages | PDF | 34.7 MB\n\nThe history of the visual arts since World War II has been extraordinarily complex, and, until now, no good concise account of the subject has been available. Edward Lucie-Smith, one of the ablest and most highly regarded of the younger generation of art critics, here provides a clear, swift-moving narrative in which he discusses all the principal art movements of the past twenty-five yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€in the United States, England, France, and other countries. He analyzes the achievements of the leading artists and describes the traditions from which they sprang, as well as the ideas that prompted each successive change in style. With an unerring sense of historical perspective, he demonstrates how each movement is related to its predecessors, rivals, and successors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5b5380f49ec8990c67508f457d50376c137a40b","amp;dn":"Late+Modern+-+The+Visual+Arts+Since+1945+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5b5380f49ec8990c67508f457d50376c137a40b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,181,56,15,73,236,137,144,198,117,8,244,87,213,3,118,193,55,164,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
