Jacobs M.D.\r\n\r\nISBN: 9780060509316\r\nISBN 10: 0060509317\r\n\r\nWhy is it so difficult to remain married in thetwenty-first century, and what can you do about it?\r\n\r\nWe all know that half of today's marriages end in divorce, but we tend to believe that our own marriages are safe.

He is a Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine where he teaches couples and family therapy to psychiatric residents.
