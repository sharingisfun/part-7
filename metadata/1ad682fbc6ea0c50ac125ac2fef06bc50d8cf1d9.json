She is the devoted wife of an accomplished publisher thirty years her senior, the proud mother of two grown children, and a trusted friend and confidant to all who cross her path. But as Pippa dutifully follows her husband to a new life in a staid Connecticut retirement community, her idyllic world and the persona she has built over the course of her marriage will be put to the ultimate test. In truth, looks are deceiving, and this picture-perfect woman has seen more than her fair share of turmoil in her youth. Embarking on a bittersweet journey of self-discovery, accompanied by a new, strange and soulful acquaintance, Pippa must now confront both her volatile past and the hidden resentment of her seemingly perfect life in order to find her true sense of self.\n\nGenre: Drama | Romance\nIMDB rating: 6.7/10 (2,080 votes)\nDirected by: Rebecca Miller\nStarring: Keanu Reeves, Monica Bellucci, Blake Lively\n\nRelease Name: The.Private.Lives.Of.Pippa.Lee.2009.LiMiTED.720p.BluRay.x264-SiNNERS\nSize: 4.37GB\nAudio Quality: DTS 5.1 1509kbps\nVideo Quality: x264 23.98fps 1280ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€688 4865kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ad682fbc6ea0c50ac125ac2fef06bc50d8cf1d9","amp;dn":"The.Private.Lives.Of.Pippa.Lee.2009.LiMiTED.720p.BluRay.x264-SiN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ad682fbc6ea0c50ac125ac2fef06bc50d8cf1d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,214,130,251,198,234,12,80,172,18,90,194,254,240,107,197,13,140,241,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
