Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have \n\nto use an older version the tutorial explains this.\n\n-- &lt;a href=&quot; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThen you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).\n\nAfter patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media\nthen use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.\n\nYou will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.\n\nNote: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the\ntrick.\n\n\nGame Description:\n\nSet in 16th Century Japan, during the period of the civil war dominated by Nobunaga Oda. You play Samanosuke Akechi, who dies during an attempt to stop the kidnapping of young princess Yuki, the sister to Yoshitatsu Saito. However, Akechi is given another chance at life, and is handed the power of the gauntlet (capable of powerful abilities). \n\nWith this new power, you must fight your way through the many levels of un-dead beings (much like another Capcom series, Resident Evil). As you defeat the enemy, it's soul is absorbed by the gauntlet, increasing its power, and your chances of victory.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Character graphics are created at an average of over 10,000 polygons per \n  character with realistic emotion and character animation.\n\n* Highly detailed 3D rendered backgrounds.\n\n* Dramatic storyline blends actual Japanese history with fictional and \n  non-fictional characters.\n\n* Background animation technology provides innovative special effects that add \n  even more realism to the game. \n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x Speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't \nworking.\n\n\nIf Using DVD+R booktype to DVD-ROM.\n(If your Mod-Chip or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R)\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a71c2e6c257b4ee2b062cec84fa2f861b004ea71","amp;dn":"Onimusha+Warlords+%5BNtsc%5D%2C+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a71c2e6c257b4ee2b062cec84fa2f861b004ea71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,28,46,108,37,123,78,226,176,98,206,200,79,162,248,97,176,4,234,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
