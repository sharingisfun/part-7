Dreyfuss, &quot;Hedge Hogs: The Cowboy Traders Behind Wall Street's Largest Hedge Fund Disaster&quot;\nISBN: 1400068398 | 2013 | MOBI | 320 pages |\n\nAt its peak, hedge fund Amaranth Advisors LLC had more than $9 billion in assets. A few weeks later, it completely collapsed. The disaster was largely triggered by one man: thirty-two-year-old hotshot trader Brian Hunter. His high-risk bets on natural gas prices bankrupted his firm and destroyed his career, while John Arnold, his rival at competitor fund Centaurus, emerged as the highest-paid trader on Wall Street. Meticulously researched and character-driven, Hedge Hogs is a riveting fly-on-the-wall account of the largest hedge fund collapse in history: a blistering tale of the recent past that explains our precarious present . . . and may predict our future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4982dba8022085b89c7cc56aade8b1afe7a6890e","amp;dn":"Hedge+Hogs%3A+The+Cowboy+Traders+Behind+Wall+Street%27s+Largest+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4982dba8022085b89c7cc56aade8b1afe7a6890e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,130,219,168,2,32,133,184,156,124,197,106,173,232,177,175,231,166,137,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
