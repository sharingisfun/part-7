We shadow Brent and the Rush sound crew as they prepare for the Denver, Colorado, show on their Clockwork Angels tour, where the band is set to perform for 12,000 fans. After the gear is loaded into the venue, Brent explains how he and the crew set up the rigging, amp racks, and fly the speaker arrays to make sure well-balanced stereo sound reaches every seat in the arena. He also shows how he sets up his console to mix the onstage sound for Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart and configures the in-ear monitor system and balance of audience mics for each member of the band. Then we get to sit backstage with Brent and watch what he does during line check, sound check, and the actual show. After the fans file out, see how all the equipment comes back down and is packed away so the cycle can start all over in the next city.\n\nTopics include:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Choosing the PA for the venue\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Setting up points, motors and cables, and trusses\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Getting the best use of both analog and digital signal paths\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How Rush gets that Geddy, Alex, and Neil live sound\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Setting up the digital monitor mix console\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Doing the line check and sound check\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Using audience microphones to connect the band to their fans\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Getting even coverage in a large arena\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Working the monitor console and the power of snapshots\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Loading out of the venue","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a35286503eecb24922f362c66a89a0fc0c11916c","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Live+Sound+Engineering.+Techniques+On+Tour+with+Rush","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a35286503eecb24922f362c66a89a0fc0c11916c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,82,134,80,62,236,178,73,34,243,98,198,106,137,160,252,12,17,145,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
