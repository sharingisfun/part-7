Together, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re plotting to overthrow Queen Levana and her army. \n\nTheir best hope lies with Cress, a girl imprisoned on a satellite since childhood who's only ever had her netscreens as company. All that screen time has made Cress an excellent hacker. Unfortunately, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just received orders from Levana to track down Cinder and her handsome accomplice. \n\nWhen a daring rescue of Cress goes awry, the group is separated. Cress finally has her freedom, but it comes at a high price. Meanwhile, Queen Levana will let nothing prevent her marriage to Emperor Kai. Cress, Scarlet, and Cinder may not have signed up to save the world, but they may be the only hope the world has.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6007892271855f5ca4272ac290e8744757e7a05c","amp;dn":"Cress+%28Lunar+Chronicles+3%29+-+Marissa+Meyer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6007892271855f5ca4272ac290e8744757e7a05c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,7,137,34,113,133,95,92,164,39,42,194,144,232,116,71,87,231,160,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
