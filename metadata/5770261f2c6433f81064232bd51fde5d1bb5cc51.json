She's an international bestseller with a readership in the millions. She's a writer who believes in the form that she has chosen to mine: &quot;The mystery novel offers a world in which justice is served. Maybe not in a court of law,&quot; she has said, &quot;but people do get their just desserts.&quot; And like Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald, Robert Parker and the John D. MacDonald-the best of her breed-she has earned new respect for that form. Her readers appreciate her buoyant style, her eye for detail, her deft hand with character, her acute social observances, and her abundant storytelling talents.\n\nKinsey Millhone series:\n1.
