David dismisses the \r\nencounter as a hallucination, but all indicators point to lycanthrope; \r\nevenings of barking and blood letting follow closely behind. While the story \r\nis thin and much of the tongue-in-cheek humour is overdone, there are plenty \r\nof genuine jolts thanks to make-up guru Rick Baker's eye-popping special \r\neffects. The werewolf, resembling a cross between a bear and a wolverine, \r\nappears frighteningly real, and, given the fantastic premise, the gore is \r\nmost convincing (although surprisingly and refreshingly scant). The hospital \r\ndream sequences are creative, and the scenes in which the werewolf runs \r\nrampant through down town London are particularly good. In all, An American \r\nWerewolf in London is an original, atmospheric film that manages both to scare \r\nand amuse. While dismissed by most American critics upon its release, the \r\nfilm managed to secure a place in the annals of American cinema when Baker \r\nwon an Academy Award for his amazing effects and creature designs.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-David Naughton.\r\n=&gt;-Jenny Agutter.\r\n=&gt;-Joe Belcher.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-John Landis.\r\n\r\nAn American Werewolf in Paris.\r\nThis British-Dutch-Luxembourgian co-production is &quot;based on characters created \r\nby John Landis&quot; for his An American Werewolf in London (1981). In the opening, \r\na man is seen under attack, almost managing an escape from the Parisian sewers \r\nbefore an unseen creature pulls him back. Meanwhile, tourist Andy (Tom Everett \r\nScott) is seeing the sights of Paris with his pals Brad (Vince Vieluf) and \r\nChris (Phil Buckman). When Serafine (Julie Delpy) leaps off the Eiffel Tower \r\njust before Andy is about to do a bungee-jump, he executes a mid-air rescue. \r\nShe vanishes into the night, leaving Andy intrigued -- and also unaware that \r\nshe is the offspring of the couple (Jenny Agutter, David Naughton) seen 16 \r\nyears earlier in An American Werewolf in London. Andy tracks her down, asks \r\nfor a date, attends a party, and winds up in her bed. When he awakens, he has \r\ntooth marks on his leg and is informed that he's making a transformation into \r\na werewolf, confirmed by his sudden taste for rare steaks. Serafine explains \r\nthat her stepfather (seen in the film's opening scene) had been working on a \r\ndrug to control her werewolf transformations. Beneath a full moon, the \r\nlycanthropic love story continues. Filmed in Luxembourg, Amsterdam, Paris, \r\nand New York, with special effects mainly from California's Santa Barbara \r\nStudios. Werewolves were created by combining prosthetic devices and \r\nanimatronics with computer-generated creatures.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Tom Everett Scott.\r\n=&gt;-Julie Delpy.\r\n=&gt;-Vince Vieluf.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Anthony Waller.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre..........................: Comedy : Horror : Thriller.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...................: 1981 : 1997.\r\n=&gt;-Language.......................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size......................: 1.36 GiB : 1.38 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...............: 2 006 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..................: 1h 37mn : 1.38mn.\r\n=&gt;-An American Werewolf in London.: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082010/\r\n=&gt;-An American Werewolf in London.: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_werewolf_in_london/\r\n=&gt;-An American Werewolf in Paris..: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118604/\r\n=&gt;-An American Werewolf in Paris..: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_werewolf_in_paris/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec..........................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...................: 16:9.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.....................: 720 x 400.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate.......................: 1 888 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec..........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels.......................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate.......................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...............: 233 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bf3d0d8dd54a47df26fc96816843fa5236d73c2","amp;dn":"An+American+Werewolf+In+London+And+In+Paris+-+Horror+Duology+198","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bf3d0d8dd54a47df26fc96816843fa5236d73c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,243,208,216,221,84,164,125,242,111,201,104,22,132,63,165,35,109,115,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
