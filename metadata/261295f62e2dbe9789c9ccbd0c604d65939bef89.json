The cover artwork is based on The Raft of the Medusa, a painting by ThÃƒÂ©odore GÃƒÂ©ricault, with the band\n members' faces replacing those of the men on the raft painted by the artist and illustrator Peter Mennim.\nRum, Sodomy &amp; the Lash received positive reviews from critics. Mark Deming of Allmusic awarded the album four and a half out of\n five stars and said that it &quot;falls just a bit short of being the Pogues best album, but was the first one to prove that they\n were a great band, and not just a great idea for a band.&quot;Robert Christgau gave the album an A and said that &quot;none of it \nwould mean much without the songsÃ¢â‚¬â€some borrowed, some traditional, and some proof that MacGowan can roll out bitter blarney with\n the best of his role models.&quot;Daniel Bristow of the Irish music website CLUAS awarded the album an eight out of ten, calling it\n &quot;a record that will never cease to delight, always a pleasure to hear and highly, highly recommended if you're not familiar\n with it already&quot;.\nIn 2000 Q placed it at number 93 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2003, the album was ranked number 445 \non Rolling Stone's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. Pitchfork Media named it the 67th best album of the 1980s.\n\n===========================================\n\nTracklist\n\n\n    1&quot;The Sick Bed of CÃƒÂºchulainn&quot; (MacGowan) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:59\n    2&quot;The Old Main Drag&quot; (MacGowan) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:19\n    3&quot;Wild Cats of Kilkenny&quot; (MacGowan/Finer) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:48\n    4&quot;I'm a Man You Don't Meet Every Day&quot; (traditional) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:55\n    5&quot;A Pair of Brown Eyes&quot; (MacGowan) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:54\n    6&quot;Sally MacLennane&quot; (MacGowan) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:43\n    7&quot;Dirty Old Town&quot; (MacColl) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:45\n    8&quot;Jesse James&quot; (traditional) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:58\n    9&quot;Navigator&quot; (Gaston) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:12\n    10&quot;Billy's Bones&quot; (MacGowan) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:02\n    11&quot;The Gentleman Soldier&quot; (traditional) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:04\n    12&quot;And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot; (Bogle) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:10\n\n==========================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 903 MB\nAlbum                                    : Rum, sodomy, and the lash \nPerformer                                : The Pogues \nGenre                                    : Punk Folk\nRecorded date                            : 1985\n\n====================================\n\nAudio\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 3 047 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:261295f62e2dbe9789c9ccbd0c604d65939bef89","amp;dn":"The+Pogues+-+Rum%2C+Sodomy+And+The+Lash+%281985%29+Flac%5B24+Bit+96KHz+V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"261295f62e2dbe9789c9ccbd0c604d65939bef89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,18,149,246,46,45,190,151,137,201,204,189,12,96,77,101,147,155,239,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
