Your life is so beautiful that you canâ€™t wait to get up to start a new day and you thank the Universe that you are alive. Think back on the most spectacular love affair of your lifeâ€”the Big One that toppled you head over heels. For most, it was a time of heartfelt bliss, robust health, and abundant energy. Life was so beautiful that you couldnâ€™t wait to bound out of bed in the morning to experience more Heaven on Earth. It was the Honeymoon Effect that was to last forever. Unfortunately for most, the Honeymoon Effect is frequently short-lived. Imagine what your planetary experience would be like if you could maintain the Honeymoon Effect throughout your whole life.\r\n\r\nBruce H. Lipton, Ph.D., bestselling author of The Biology of Belief, describes how the Honeymoon Effect was not a chance event or a coincidence, but a personal creation. This book reveals how we manifest the Honeymoon Effect and the reasons why we lose it. This knowledge empowers readers to create the honeymoon experience again, this time in a way that ensures a happily-ever-after relationship that even a Hollywood producer would love. With authority, eloquence, and an easy-to-read style, Lipton covers the influence of quantum physics (good vibrations), biochemistry (love potions), and psychology (the conscious and subconscious minds) in creating and sustaining juicy loving relationships. He also asserts that if we use the 50 trillion cells that live harmoniously in every healthy human body as a model, we can create not just honeymoon relationships for couples but also a â€œsuper organismâ€ called humanity that can heal our planet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d356eb858181b7852bb2f412058a910fa439372","amp;dn":"Bruce+Lipton-The+Honeymoon+effect","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d356eb858181b7852bb2f412058a910fa439372","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,53,110,184,88,24,27,120,82,187,47,65,32,88,169,16,250,67,147,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
