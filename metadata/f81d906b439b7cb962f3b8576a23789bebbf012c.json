Two women exact an uncompromising assault on their position in society and become the sexual aggressors with guns. Porn stars in leading roles, graphic violence and real sex. Extreme in every sense.\n\n\n\nComment:\nThis is kinda like a French version of Thelma &amp; Louise. \nExtremely explicit, well acted, great movie, which was banned in many countries and provinces. \n\nBased on the novel by Virginie Despentes of the same title. \nManu and Nadine lose their last tenuous relationship with main-stream society when Manu gets raped and Nadine sees her only friend being shot. After a chance encounter, they embark on an explosive journey of sex and murder. Perhaps as a revenge against men, perhaps as a revolt against bourgeois society, but certainly in a negation - almost joyful in its senseless violence - of all the codes of a society which has excluded, raped and humiliated them. Controversial for its violence and real sex scenes: a vividly nihilist road movie set in France.\n\n\nStarring:\nKaren Lancaume, RaffaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«la Anderson\n\n\nReelased:  2000\nDuration:  01:13:35\nFormat:    avi\n\nAudio:      French\nSubs:       English\nCategory:   Feature, Softcore, Controversial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f81d906b439b7cb962f3b8576a23789bebbf012c","amp;dn":"Baise-Moi+%28%60Rape+Me%60+%29+%282000%2Cxvid+-+French%2C+banned%29++-+Eng.subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f81d906b439b7cb962f3b8576a23789bebbf012c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,29,144,107,67,155,124,185,98,243,184,87,106,35,120,155,235,191,1,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
