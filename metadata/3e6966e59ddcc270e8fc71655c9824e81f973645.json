It represents the first album recorded by the reformed, the most successful and popular, 'Mark II' line-up.\n\nIt was the first Deep Purple studio album in nine years, and the first with the Mk II line-up for eleven years, the last being Who Do We Think We Are in 1973. Ritchie Blackmore and Roger Glover arrived from Rainbow, Ian Gillan from Black Sabbath, Jon Lord from Whitesnake, and Ian Paice from Gary Moore's backing band.\n\nThe CD and cassette versions of the album contained the extra track &quot;Not Responsible&quot; (one of few Deep Purple songs with profane lyrics, as the word &quot;fucking&quot; can be heard in the song). The album was remastered and reissued on 22 June 1999 with the bonus instrumental track &quot;Son of Alerik&quot;. The latter had previously been available as a B-side on &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; in 1984.\n\nThe tour was so successful that the band had to add many additional dates to the US arena tour, as tickets sold out very quickly. Their US tour in 1985 out-grossed every artist that year except Bruce Springsteen.\n\n\nDeep Purple are an English rock band formed in Hertford in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although their musical approach changed over the years. Originally formed as a progressive rock band, the band shifted its sound to hard rock in 1970, and in 2013 began exploring progressive metal. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the &quot;unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-Seventies&quot;. They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as &quot;the globe's loudest band&quot; for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre, and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide, including 8.5 million certified units in the US.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Strangers_(album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Strangers_(album)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/uw18tn18j/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/uw18tn18j/&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8242kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bits]\n   Duration: 00:03:58\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
