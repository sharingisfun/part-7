For centuries, adventurers and Egyptologists have crawled through every passageway and chamber of the Pyramid, measuring and collecting data in an attempt to determine how it was built.\nFor the first time, a revolutionary theory argues that the answer may be inside the Pyramid. National Geographic follows renowned experts as they find surprising evidence to support this intriguing new theory.
