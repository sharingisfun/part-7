However, thanks to startling developments in military and communications technology, this perennial threat to freedom and security has taken a quantum leap forward during the past thirty years. In many cases, these vicious and determined men and women have supplanted nation states on the globe's &quot;most wanted&quot; list! This extraordinary 26-episode series provides a comprehensive look at these modern masters of political murder and extortion. From the I.R.A. to al-Qaeda, Global Terror runs the gamut of groups that have pledged themselves to destroy the stability that we cling to so tenuously-examining their goals, their methods and their terrifying prospects for success!\n\n\n1)  Early Israeli Terrorism \nEarly Israeli Terrorism starts by looking at the events of 22 July 1946, when a massive explosion ripped through the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, headquarters of the British administration in Palestine. It killed 91 people in the latest and most shocking attack to be mounted by a deadly group of Jewish terrorists as they fought to drive the British out of Palestine and establish a homeland of their own - Israel. Although the King David Hotel was one of the worst Israeli terrorist attacks, it was still just one of many. Other targets included bridges, military bases, public buildings and railways as well as politicians and soldiers marked for assassination. Ironically, several leading Israeli terrorists would eventually emerge as internationally respected leaders of their countries\n\n2)  The Al Qaeda Menace (Bin Laden) \nAfter the First Gulf War, Islamic Fundamentalism in Saudi Arabia was handed a gift by the extended presence of coalition troops close to the Holy sites of Mecca and Medina. The Wahabi sect from the West of Saudi were particularly incensed and devised a plan to strike back at Western interests and the USA in particular. They were led by a wealthy Arab graduate named Osama Bin Laden, whose knowledge of architecture gave rise to a plan to destroy one of the most potent symbols of American power. With colossal funds supplied by wealthy Arab benefactors, The Al-Qaeda Menace looks at how Bin Laden built an international network of trained terrorists.\n\n3)  The IRA \nIreland was Britain's oldest colony and, for hundreds of years, ideas of Irish Nationalism simmered under the surface of the Empire's calm. After the Easter Rising and the establishment of Home Rule for the Republic of Eire, discontent continued in the Northern provinces, where the Catholics were in a minority and discriminated against both politically and in ordinary life. In the mid-1960s, discontent erupted into violence and the Irish Republican Army began a terror campaign which finally resulted in the British Army being called out onto the streets of Belfast. The 'Troubles', as they became known, gave rise to a savage form of urban warfare, typified by indiscriminate car bombings, tit-for-tat sectarian shootings and spectacular bomb outrages on the British mainland.\n\n4)  Fata Hamas \nFounded in the late 1950s, Fatah is the Arab organisation which provides part of the present-day government for the Palestinian lands of Gaza and the West Bank. Currently locked in a violent struggle with Hamas, its Muslim rival party founded 30 years later, it has sought to represent the interests of the Palestinian people on the world stage by standing up to Israel, sponsoring terrorism and attempting to win back lands, which it claims belongs to the Palestinian people. It has committed a number of significant outrages since its inception and has been an unrelenting adversary towards Israel and the West generally. After the establishment of Israel in 1948, its history has been one of continuing harassment and conflict in order to win what it sees as its rightful territory. This BBC programme Fatah / Hamas looks at these events through history.\n\n5)  PLO \nFounded by the Egyptian President Colonel Nasser in 1964, the Palestinian Liberation Organisation has become one of the most effective terrorist organisations the world has ever known, championing a violent form of protest against Israel and the West since World War II. Dominated by Yasser Arafat for 35 years, the PLO and its affiliates were responsible for a long list of shocking acts of terror, including, kidnapping, murder, bombing and plane hijacks.\n\n6)  ETA \nBetween Spain and France on the Atlantic coast is the Basque region of Spain, which has for centuries been a unique culture and people bearing allegiance to neither of its large neighbours. In 1937, General Franco occupied the Basque country, abolished their existing degree of autonomy and ruthlessly repressed their aspirations for independence. ETA (short for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna which means Basque fatherland and freedom) was founded in 1959. Initially peaceful, it quickly evolved into the terrorist branch of the Basque separatist movement and to date has caused upwards of 800 deaths. Since the death of General Franco in particular, ETA has bombed its way into the headlines by committing outrage after outrage designed to weaken Spanish resolve and grant regional independence to its distinctive population.\n\n7)  The Baader Meinhof Gang \nTerrorised West Germany throughout the 1970s and 1980s with a brutal campaign of bombing, kidnapping and murder. Born from the radical student movement of the late 1960s and self-styled as the Red Army Faction (RAF), it comprised mainly middle-class youngsters who saw themselves as urban guerrillas engaged in an armed struggle against the State, rather than as a gang of terrorists.\n\n8)  EOKA \nFollowing the Ottoman Empire's defeat in World War I, Cyprus was annexed by Britain in 1925 to protect its sea route to India via the Suez Canal. The terror group EOKA (EthnikÃƒÂ­ Organosis KipriakÃƒÂ³u Agonos) was an underground organization formed by the former Greek army officer George Grivas in 1955 to force the British out of Cyprus and unite the Mediterranean island with Greece.\n\n9)  Nasser and Egyptian Terrorism \nAs President of Egypt, Gamal Abdul Nasser wanted to be regarded as a distinguished international statesman. He was also the man who founded the Palestine Liberation Organisation, one of the world's greatest ever terrorist movements. But once he handed the PLO over to Yasser Arafat, Nasser ceased to have any real influence over the organisation.\n\n10)  Colonel Gaddafi and Libya \nEarly on the evening of 21 December 1988, Boeing 747 Pam Am flight 103, en route from London Heathrow to New York, was torn apart by a massive mid-air explosion above the town of Lockerbie in Scotland. There were no survivors - 243 passengers and the crew of 16 all died. But the tragedy did not end there. Eleven people on the ground also died and 21 houses were completely destroyed in the carnage. As crash investigators rushed to the scene early the following day, it soon became apparent that this was no accident and the CIA reported that a number of international terrorist organisations were already claiming responsibility. At the time, it was the worst terrorist attack in USA history and a grim warning to American citizens that they could no longer regard themselves as immune from the forces of international terrorism.\n\n11)  The OAS \nIn 1961, the French colony of Algeria in North Africa began moving towards independence with the full support of President Charles de Gaulle. This outraged a group of hardline ex-French Army officers and they formed an organisation known as the OAS (Organisation de l'armee secrÃƒÂ¨te). Determined to keep Algeria in French hands, the OAS embarked on a terror campaign which left hundreds dead, both in Algeria and mainland France.\n\n12)  The SLA and Patty Hearst \nOn 4 February 1974, Patty Hearst, the 19-year-old student heiress and granddaughter of publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, was kidnapped from her residence in Berkeley, California. For the next two months, by her account, she was kept in a closet, sexually and physically abused, and &quot;brainwashed&quot; by the small group of radicals called the SLA (Symbionese Liberation Army) who targeted wealthy capitalists as the ultimate enemy. The Hearst family agreed to the initial demands, which included the distribution of millions of dollars worth of food, but negotiations reached a stalemate. Then the SLA publicized a photo of Patty, machine gun in hand, apparently a willing convert to revolution. She took the name 'Tania' (a tribute to the wife of Che Guevara).\n\n13)  The Weathermen \nDuring the 1970s, a terror gang known as The Weathermen embarked on a bombing campaign across the USA as they sought to overthrow the government through violent revolution. Their targets included banks, universities, police and government buildings and the offices of multi-national corporations. Born out of the anti-Vietnam war protest movement, the Weathermen were, for the most part, well-educated young men and women from comfortable middle-class backgrounds. However, their violence failed to attract a significant number of recruits and, by the early 1980s, the organisation had more or less run its course.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/9026/8xfa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/9026/8xfa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/2772/od0b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/2772/od0b.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/599/duhn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/599/duhn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9793/cnnz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9793/cnnz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/796/r9zq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/796/r9zq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/792/f6ta.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/792/f6ta.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/2215/s1u4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/2215/s1u4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/2566/upyg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/2566/upyg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/5206/i0mg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/5206/i0mg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;83cee2eaedc3cfb0adb3&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1335 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 28mins\n * Framerate: 29fps\n * Number of Parts: 26\n * Part Size: average 249 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbcactivevideoforlearning.com/1/SeriesDetails.aspx?SeriesID=957&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbcactivevideoforlearning.com/1/SeriesDetails.aspx?SeriesID=957&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6810e89921d827dd6a810d0d27cddf1ad079550d","amp;dn":"International+Terrorism+01of26+Early+Israeli+Terrorism+DVDRip+x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6810e89921d827dd6a810d0d27cddf1ad079550d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,16,232,153,33,216,39,221,106,129,13,13,39,205,223,26,208,121,85,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
