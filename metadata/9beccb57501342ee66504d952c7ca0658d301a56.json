A skilled improviser whose lengthy career began in the '30s when he co-led the Quintet of the Hot Club de France with Django Reinhardt, Grappelli had a very productive comeback during the time period covered by this collection. The cast of creative collaborators includes guitarists Diz Disley, Ike Isaacs, and Larry Coryell, pianists Michel Legrand and George Shearing, and bassists Eberhard Weber and Niels-Henning ÃƒÆ’Ã‹Å“rsted Pedersen. ~ arwulf arwulf, All Music Guide\n\nThis was my first Grappelli album, and is still one of my big favorites. The tunes are classic, recorded from 1966-1992. There's a combination of Django-influenced tracks (violin, guitars and bass only), as well as some with the standard piano-bass-drums rhythm section. The album has a different flavor from the Pre-War recordings; beefier in terms of sound and harmony, but the swing is unbeatable. Perfect for a &quot;petit gout&quot; of Grappelli. ~ A Customer, Amazon\n\nI first discovered Stephane Grappelli in a jazz compilation. I was so taken with the cut that I bought this album the same day, and I was definitely not disappointed. &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot; is sweet as can be. &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot; is smooth and beautiful.  For those who have not encountered Grappelli's music before, you are in for a real treat. He pioneered the use of the violin in jazz, and his fiddling will have you tapping your toes before you know it! ~ Michael McDaniel\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 11 - Stephane Grappelli Tracks:\n01  Pennies From Heaven Stephane Grappelli 3:51    \n02  Solitude Stephane Grappelli 4:13    \n03  Ain't Misbehavin' Stephane Grappelli 3:18    \n04  Star Eyes Stephane Grappelli 3:12    \n05  Insensiblement Stephane Grappelli 4:55    \n06  The Folks Who Live On The Hill Oscar Peterson 5:36    \n07  Nuages Stephane Grappelli 5:32    \n08  Manoir De Mes Reves / Daphne Stephane Grappelli 4:23    \n09  Are You In The Mood?
