Over the course of 12 days, our 'recruits' are pushed beyond their physical and mental limits by battle-hardened veterans from the world's toughest Special Forces, from the Navy Seals to the British SAS.\r\nBased on the special forces' selection methods, every 48 hours the recruits are put through a set of challenges, each one designed to break them down and every one more difficult than the last. In the end there can only be one winner of Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week.\r\n\r\n4)  Australian SAS \r\nAfter three back-to-back challenges, the 13 remaining recruits are battered and bruised, sleep-deprived and physically exhausted. But they are about to face their toughest challenge yet, all under the orders of Jason Falla, a former member of the Australian SAS. For the first time, the recruits will learn what it is like to go behind enemy lines as they take part in a military role play to help supply a guerrilla force. Under Jason's eagle eyes, they will have to prove that they have the mental strength to operate in hostile territory whilst marching through the night and facing the demands of the guerrilla army.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c7/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1b/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dd/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4e/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/63/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/ba/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b4/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/55/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dd/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9f/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3006 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b069ccw0\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Special%20Forces%3A%20Series%201","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29dbde32210fb5c1fe7c0180374ecf291f9c7b60","amp;dn":"BBC+Special+Forces+Ultimate+Hell+Week+4of6+Australian+SAS+720p+x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29dbde32210fb5c1fe7c0180374ecf291f9c7b60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,219,222,50,33,15,181,193,254,124,1,128,55,78,207,41,31,156,123,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
