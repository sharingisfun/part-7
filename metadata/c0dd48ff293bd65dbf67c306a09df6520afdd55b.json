Part one covers the technical history of helicopter flight, basic methods of rotor aerodynamics, and performance-related design issues. Part two contains advanced topics in helicopter aerodynamics, including airfoil flows, unsteady aerodynamics, dynamic stall, rotor wakes, and rotor-airframe aerodynamic interactions. Part three contains chapters on autogiros and advanced aerodynamic analysis and a new chapter on the aerodynamics of wind turbines. The book is extensively illustrated and contains homework problems.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0dd48ff293bd65dbf67c306a09df6520afdd55b","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Helicopter+Aerodynamics+J+Gordon+Leishman+Santhan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0dd48ff293bd65dbf67c306a09df6520afdd55b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,221,72,255,41,59,214,93,191,103,195,6,160,157,246,82,10,253,213,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
