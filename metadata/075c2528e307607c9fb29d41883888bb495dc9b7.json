General Electric had already stolen the march on 2,500hp locomotives with its U25B, and although the GP20 was only rated at 2,250hp, EMD traded on its reputation to sell units to US railroads. \n\nIn total, 948 models were built between July 1961 and November 1963 for railroads in the US and Canada, including 40 cabless B units for the Union Pacific Railroad. Some elements of the earlier GP20 were carried across, although the GP30Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark Ã¢â‚¬ËœhumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and cab roof profile made it stand out from other similar diesel locomotives. \n\nA number of GP30s remain in service today in their original or rebuilt form, with 17 models currently preserved, some still in operational condition. \n\nThe EMD GP30 for Train Simulator, developed by DigitalTrainModel, is available in Union Pacific livery and features opening cab doors and windows, cab lights, a strobe light, numberboard lights and platform lights. A cabless 'B' unit is also included to recreate prototypical workings, alongside a number of freight cars such as 40ft Airslide Hoppers, 50ft Boxcars, Flatcars with loads, Hopper Grains, a Caboose and 70ton Coal Hoppers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:075c2528e307607c9fb29d41883888bb495dc9b7","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+Union+Pacific+GP30+Loco+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"075c2528e307607c9fb29d41883888bb495dc9b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,92,37,40,227,7,96,124,159,178,157,65,136,56,136,187,73,93,201,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
