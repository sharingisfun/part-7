ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a documentary of sorts about the Sahara desert and its mirages, as well as the people who live in the area.\n\nThe film is divided into three parts. The first, Ã¢â‚¬Å“CreationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, is a series of lengthy shots of the desert accompanied by a sporadic commentary spoken by Lotte Eisner and taken from the Mayan creation myth the Popol Vuh. The second part, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ParadiseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, is about the community of people living in the middle of the desert with an ironic narration from Herzog and occasional diversions into natural history Ã¢â‚¬â€œ much emphasis is placed on the survival capacity of a lizard. The final part, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Golden AgeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, begins very bizarrely with a middle-aged couple playing piano and drums and what appears to be a kazoo. It then goes on to consider the turtle and finishes with an examination of what has happened to the planet.\n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Fata Morgana.1971.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 9 715 Kbps\nLength            : 5.18 GiB for 1h 16mn 22s 16ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 960 x 720 (1.333) at 24.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : DTS at 1 509 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : de\n\nAudio #1          : DTS at 1 509 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nAudio #2          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067085/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067085/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: German or English (Film) English (Commentary)\nSubtitles: English\n\nMy rip\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f557cfbbe96f082356f9731f1b41cd1cab4854f6","amp;dn":"Fata+Morgana.1971.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f557cfbbe96f082356f9731f1b41cd1cab4854f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,87,207,187,233,111,8,35,86,249,115,31,27,65,205,28,171,72,84,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
