The AbsolutePunk review called the albums sound post-hardcore, and while it had good characteristics, it continued to call the album generic, and that the focus throughout the album was random, stating that at certain parts of the album, it can either have too much effort or not enough, and also went on to say that the lyrics were clichÃƒÂ© however relate-able, and went on to praise the vocals and range of different vibes and sounds.\n\nAlternative Press called the albums sound primarily metalcore although comparing its efforts and overall sound to the likes of Dillinger Escape Plan, Botch and Breach, gave it a poor overview, and criticized its addition to dubstep sounds and elements throughout the album.\n\nTracklist\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Oh, Catastrophe&quot;   \t1:59\n2. \t&quot;The Fallout&quot;   \t3:56\n3. \t&quot;Memories of a Broken Heart&quot;   \t4:13\n4. \t&quot;Makeshift Chemistry&quot;   \t4:11\n5. \t&quot;The One You Feed&quot;   \t3:53\n6. \t&quot;Menace&quot;   \t4:28\n7. \t&quot;Graveyard Souls&quot;   \t3:22\n8. \t&quot;Two's Too Many&quot;   \t3:05\n9. \t&quot;Evidence&quot;   \t3:26\n10. \t&quot;Children of Love&quot;   \t3:04\n11. \t&quot;Johnny's Revenge&quot;   \t4:15\nTotal length:\n\t39:42 \t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24e7932dc6077543394e1dc8665cea0aedbf1f92","amp;dn":"Crown+The+Empire+-+The+Fallout++mp3+320k+++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24e7932dc6077543394e1dc8665cea0aedbf1f92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,231,147,45,198,7,117,67,57,78,29,200,102,92,234,10,237,191,31,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
