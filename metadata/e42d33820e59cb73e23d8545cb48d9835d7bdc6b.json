And what does he have to do with the judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s untimely demise? His name, for the moment, is Malcolm Bannister. Job status? Former attorney. Current residence? The Federal Prison Camp near Frostburg, Maryland.\n\nOn paper, MalcolmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s situation isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t looking too good these days, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got an ace up his sleeve. He knows who killed Judge Fawcett, and he knows why. The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body was found in his remote lakeside cabin. There was no forced entry, no struggle, just two dead bodies: Judge Fawcett and his young secretary. And one large, state-of-the-art, extremely secure safe, opened and emptied.\n\nWhat was in the safe? The FBI would love to know. And Malcolm Bannister would love to tell them. But everything has a priceÃ¢â‚¬â€especially information as explosive as the sequence of events that led to Judge FawcettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. And the Racketeer wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t born yesterday . . .\n\nNothing is as it seems and everythingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fair game in this wickedly clever new novel from John Grisham, the undisputed master of the legal thriller.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e42d33820e59cb73e23d8545cb48d9835d7bdc6b","amp;dn":"The+Racketeer+-+John+Grisham.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e42d33820e59cb73e23d8545cb48d9835d7bdc6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,45,51,130,14,89,203,115,226,61,133,69,203,72,217,131,93,123,220,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
