By approaching these skills in tandem, Mark Allen Weiss teaches readers to develop well-constructed, maximally efficient programs using the C++ programming language.\n\nThis book explains topics from binary heaps to sorting to NP-completeness, and dedicates a full chapter to amortized analysis and advanced data structures and their implementation. Figures and examples illustrating successive stages of algorithms contribute to WeissÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ careful, rigorous and in-depth analysis of each type of algorithm.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425f1ebf6187af21fffb538c972ed9637d00e7f1","amp;dn":"Data+Structures+Algorithm+Analysis+in+Cplusplus+4th+dition.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425f1ebf6187af21fffb538c972ed9637d00e7f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,95,30,191,97,135,175,33,255,251,83,140,151,46,217,99,125,0,231,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
