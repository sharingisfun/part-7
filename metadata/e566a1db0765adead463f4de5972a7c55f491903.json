Finally, in late winter of 2013, a crowdfunding effort was announced and enthusiastically greeted by supporters the world over. In brief, Outbound is a story of the success of independent music, it is a story of the grandeur of the infinite cosmos, and ultimately, it is a story of continued musical excellence.\n\nThose of us lucky enough to have been able to back the project were able to hear two songs early: opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“Burn The SkyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Morning Light MountainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. As Ã¢â‚¬Å“singlesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of a sort go, these songs were good choices: they are amongst the most immediately gripping songs on the album, and well placed near the beginning. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Burn The SkyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a suitably anthemic opening number on par with the melodic finesse of  HeavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s GateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“CrusaderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Journey Of SoulsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Last FrontierÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Ã¢â‚¬Å“EarthbloodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an interesting tune, and not one that I was prepared to hear the first time it came on. A slower track, at times stomping and at times glimmering like a mirage, it also capitalizes on KeldianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputation for unexpectedly gripping melodies. It has proved to be a slow grower for me, and along with the following, somewhat more basic Ã¢â‚¬Å“Never ExistedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, is among the less exceptional of the songs here. Considering the overall bulletproof strength of the album, however, this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t much of a complaint.\n\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to pause and comment that everything that made Keldian what it was is here in force on Outbound. The band is undoubtedly sounding more modern and more heavy than ever, and thanks to the increased usage of sound samples, the increased experimentation with tonality, more varied guitar timbres, more active keyboard work, and increased usage of vocal effects, Keldian sounds more varied and subtly progressive than ever before. All of this also has the added effect of making Outbound a more lively-feeling album. Journey Of Souls was a powerful display of smoothness and glossy melodicism, but Outbound just feels more alive, more emotional, more frantic, and more human.  The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first two albums had a real knack for basic, almost minimalistic efficiency in their melodies, and this was particularly true of the keys.  Outbound is less of a simple album: there are more sounds here, and the songs are draped in richer layers than ever before, but the same melodic efficiency can be noted, particularly in the slow but enchanting Ã¢â‚¬Å“Morning Light MountainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Kepler And 100,000 StarsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ hearkens back more readily to the sound the band embraced upon Journey Of Souls, and but for the production, could have been pulled off of that album. This sort of behavior impresses me: though considerably more dynamic than past works, this album flows organically. The band seems to have penned whatever idea came to mind, and built the songs quite naturally. This can be the sort of behavior that leads to too much experimentation, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll admit that upon first listen I was a little perplexed at the new sounds here. Repeated spins, however, have only impressed the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s matured songwriting  upon me. Speaking of maturity, the true test of such a thing tends to be epics (or near-epics, in this case), and the 12 minute Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Silfen PathsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the longest song the band has ever committed to CD. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bit soft and drawn out at times, with a good deal of light, spacey portions, but the verses and chorus are excellent, the singing superb (Christer is more confident and potent than ever), and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d quickly call it a success.\n\nRounding out the album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Run For Your LifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is another throwback to earlier days, complete with a short but bright guitar solo, and the same textural minimalism that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already discussed;Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½A Place Above The AirÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a Theocracy and Sonata Arctica-like knack for making a cry of desperation come off as one of the hookiest mid-paced power metal tunes youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hear this year; and the backers-exclusive bonus track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Scoundrel DaysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (an A-ha cover) is a fun take on the tune, but nothing compared to KeldianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regular work. Nothing, however, could have prepared me for the album closer proper: Ã¢â‚¬Å“F.T.L.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been a Keldian fan almost since IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been a metalhead, and I remember hearing HeavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gate when it came out in 2007, so it is not lightly that I say that I find Ã¢â‚¬Å“F.T.L.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to be the best song that Keldian has ever written. In my personal book, the blend of tempos, uplifting, adventurous lyricism, and utterly stupendous melody creates an almost spiritual experience.\n\nMy final verdict is nearly as good as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve given any album. While it seemed a little too experimental and off the beaten path at first, Outbound has thoroughly impressed me. In the interest of getting a review out in short order, all of my listening and writing has occurred inside 24 hours, but I have no doubt that this work will continue to grow on me over the coming weeks and months, as most favorites do. This is Keldian at their most mature, with all the aptitude of prior works.\n\nOutbound is an expression of friends and musicians creating something that is truly overwhelming, it is an expression of near-transcendent inspiration, and it is the story of why I listen to music.\n\nNot even space and time can touch this ship of mine\nTrue pioneers leave everything behind\n\n\n\n\n \t\t00 Keldian album art 01.JPG\t          64.53 KB\n \t\t01 Burn The Sky.mp3 320CBR\t          10.06 MB\n \t\t02 Earthblood.mp3 320CBR\t          11.70 MB\n \t\t03 Never Existed.mp3 320CBR\t           9.71 MB\n \t\t04 Morning Light Mountain.mp3 320CBR\t  16.36 MB\n \t\t05 Kepler And 100 000 Stars.mp3 320CBR\t  11.75 MB\n \t\t06 The Silfen Paths.mp3 320CBR\t          27.43 MB\n \t\t07 Run For Your Life.mp3 320CBR\t           7.83 MB\n \t\t08 A Place Above The Air.mp3 320CBR\t   9.86 MB\n \t\t09 F.T.L..mp3 320CBR\t                  15.57 MB\n \t\tKeldian - Outbound.m3u\t                    588 bytes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e566a1db0765adead463f4de5972a7c55f491903","amp;dn":"Keldian+-+Outbound+%28320CBR%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e566a1db0765adead463f4de5972a7c55f491903","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,102,161,219,7,101,173,234,212,99,244,222,89,114,167,197,95,73,25,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
