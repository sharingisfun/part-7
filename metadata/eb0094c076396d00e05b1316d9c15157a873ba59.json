Eventually they fall in love, but the evil sorcerer Rothbart (Jack Palance), desiring the throne for himself, enchants the princess Odette (Michelle Nicastro). She is a swan by day, and becomes a woman only when the moon rises. Prince Derek (Howard McGillin) refuses to accept another bride and continues to search for his lost love. When he finds her, Derek must fight the sorcerer to free her from the spell. Winner of the Film Advisory Board Award of Excellence and the ParentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Choice Award, this adventure exhibits high quality animation and a blend of romantic and humorous musical numbers. The animal characters are fun without being too cute, including Jean-Bob the frog who thinks he is a prince, given voice by John Cleese. The subtle layering of spiritual symbolism makes this film intelligent enough for adults to enjoy as well as children\n\nRelease Group: CM8(P2P)\nRelease Name: The Swan Princess Christmas 2012 DVDRip XVID AC3 HQ Hive-CM8\nRelease Date: 02-11-12\nFilename: The.Swan.Princess.Christmas.2012.DVDRip.XVID.AC3.HQ.Hive-CM8\nSource: DVD\nSize: 1.14GB\nGenre: Animation | Adventure | Fantasy | Musical\nVideo: AVI | 720Ãƒâ€”400 | 1699 kbps\nAudio: English | AC3 | 192 kbps\nSubs: (HERE)\nIMDB Rating: N/A\nRT Critics: N/A\nDirected By: Richard Rich\nStarring: Yuri Lowenthal, David Lodge and G.K.
