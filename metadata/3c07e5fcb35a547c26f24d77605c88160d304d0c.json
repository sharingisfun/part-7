The is precursor of the &quot;Visual Key&quot; Movement with others legendarys japanese band like LUNA SEA, BUCK-TICK, KUROYUME, D'ERLANGER, etc.\n\nX-Japan was very famous around of the world, and was very influent for future bands in Japan (for example, L'Arc~en~Ciel, GLAY, etc.)\n\nBut, in 1997 the band disolves and after one year, in 1998, the guitarist and chorus HIDE, died tragically on May 2, 1998, found hung to a doorknob by a towel at 7:30 am. This news stunned Japan's youth: four fans around the country attempted suicide, two of whom died. A lot of speculation about his death has taken place, but no definitive explanation has been found. An apparent suicide, it's thought to be an accidental death, but there is not a clear motive for either suicide or murder. YOSHIKI entered in a depressive state for almost three years, being unable to compose or play.\n\nIn 2007 was confirmed a reunion after 10 years of disolve. The band had its first live performance on October 22, 2007\n\nBut the tragedy continues around the band. On July 11th 2011, TAIJI (bassist of the band) was arrested and charged with allegedly assaulting a female member of a Delta Airline flight crew, which was in route to Saipan from Tokyo. On July 14th, he was rushed to the intensive care unit after hanging himself with a bed sheet, an act which left him on coma. His mother and fiancÃƒÂ©e elected to remove him from artificial support, and TAIJI died at 11 A.M., on July 17th.\n\nActually, since 2011 X-Japan continue inactive.\n\n+ info at Generasia and wikipedia:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.generasia.com/wiki/X-Japan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.generasia.com/wiki/X-Japan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Japan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Japan&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nDownload &amp; Enjoy :)...
