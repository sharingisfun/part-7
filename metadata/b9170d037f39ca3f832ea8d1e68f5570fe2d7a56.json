In 1980, McNabb joined up with drummer Chris Sharrock (who had previously drummed for many Liverpool bands) and bassist Chris Layhe (who had been recruited though a classified ad), and they began playing as The Icicle Works. By the end of 1981, the trio had recorded a six-song independently released cassette, and in 1982 they released the independent single &quot;Nirvana&quot;. The following year, the Icicle Works were signed to the Beggars Banquet label, who issued the single &quot;Birds Fly (Whisper to a Scream)&quot; on their subsidiary label Situation Two.\n\nLater that year, The Icicle Works' released their biggest UK hit, 1983's &quot;Love Is a Wonderful Colour&quot;, which was a UK Top 15 single. Their debut eponymous album (1984) followed shortly thereafter, and reached number 24 on the UK charts, and entered the U.S. top 40. Also appearing on the U.S. top 40 singles charts at around the same time (and hitting the Canadian top twenty) was &quot;Whisper to a Scream (Birds Fly)&quot;, a retitled and slightly remixed version of the band's Situation Two release of 1983.\n\n1   Whisper To A Scream (Birds Fly) (3:46)\n \n2   In The Cauldron Of Love (3:48) \n\n3   Nirvana (5:05) \n\n4   Lover's Day (4:45) \n\n5   A Factory In The Desert (3:10) \n\n6   Waterline (4:04) \n\n7   Chop The Tree (4:40) \n\n8   Out Of Season (4:45) \n\n9   As The Dragonfly Flies (3:58) \n\n10  Love Is A Wonderful Colour (4:12) \n\n    Producer - David Lord  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9170d037f39ca3f832ea8d1e68f5570fe2d7a56","amp;dn":"Icicel+Works+-+Icicle+Works+%5B1984%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9170d037f39ca3f832ea8d1e68f5570fe2d7a56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,23,13,3,127,57,202,63,131,46,168,209,230,143,85,112,254,45,122,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
