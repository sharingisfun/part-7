Yet the label refused to shoehorn Charles into strictly sticking with vocal fare. Recognizing his jazz and blues roots, Atlantic both permitted and encouraged him to record instrumental sides with jazz combos and pursue piano-based material with which he was originally associated.\nMastered from the original master tapes, and restored to a quality that hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been realized since the initial pressings more than 50 years ago, Mobile FidelityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hybrid SACD version of The Genius After Hours takes its place as one of the most unsurpassed-sounding examples ofÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nCharlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ first love affair: jazz and blues. Opening up the veil onto these early 1960s sessions, the collectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disc functions as a tableside-seat at a smoky jazz club where, for sheer fun and amusement, Charles gathers with a handful of cohorts and lets loose with hard-bop standards and swinging rhythms. The cavity of CharlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ instrument, acoustic signatures of the stand-up bass lines, and swish of the percussion are all presented with unfettered realism.\n\nTaken from the same three studio gatherings that yielded The Great Ray Charles, the eight tunes here feature the icon pairing with both a trio and a septet. Longtime collaborator David Ã¢â‚¬Å“FatheadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Newman plays tenor and alto sax, while trumpeter Joseph Bridgewater and bassist Oscar Pettiford also contribute memorable performances. Hall of Fame producer Quincy Jones handles the arrangements on the bigger-band tracks. Yet the star of the program remains Charles, and the carefree, charming manner in which he causes the music to move in any direction he wills.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:392cec48cb2d7b04a47c453644e1f7ead943d1f2","amp;dn":"Ray+Charles+-+The+Genius+After+Hours+%282014%29+MFSL+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"392cec48cb2d7b04a47c453644e1f7ead943d1f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,44,236,72,203,45,123,4,164,124,69,54,68,225,247,234,217,67,209,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
