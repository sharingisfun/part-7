It's the day before his first solo concert, where he is going to play Bach. While he strolls around the city he is thinking, not so much about the concert as about himself, both as a lonely foreigner and as a human being in cosmos. Here and there he encounters some racist comments, but mostly he just feels the weight of social exclusion because of his otherness, especially when it comes to women. On the morning of the day for his concert the embassy informs him that his whole family has perished. He feels totally broken, although he thinks that everyone holds some pain inside. His piano teacher, a professor at the Academy, looks him up, and tells him that he heard what has happened. The professor advises him to communicate his feelings that evening by using his Bach. \n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Fuga na cernÃƒÂ½ch klÃƒÂ¡vesÃƒÂ¡ch.1965.DVDRip.x264.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 470 Kbps\nLength            : 602 MiB for 34mn 4s 320ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 267 Kbps\nAspect            : 718 x 576 (1.328) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : cs\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : cs\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : cs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387235/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387235/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio Language: Czech\nSubtitles: English, Czech\n\n Fuga na cernÃƒÂ½ch klÃƒÂ¡vesÃƒÂ¡ch AKA Fugue on the Black Keys (1965)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3442459f4acc421d5165bb16e6a23b104ebd7f4b","amp;dn":"Fuga+na+cern%26yacute%3Bch+kl%26aacute%3Bves%26aacute%3Bch.1965.DVDRip.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3442459f4acc421d5165bb16e6a23b104ebd7f4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,66,69,159,74,204,66,29,81,101,187,22,230,162,59,16,78,189,127,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
