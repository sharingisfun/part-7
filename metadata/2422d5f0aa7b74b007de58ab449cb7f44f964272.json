Most of it was recorded with a small group of orchestral musicians affiliated with Bedroom Community, the collective that also includes composers Nico Muhly, Ben Frost, Valgeir SigurÃƒÂ°sson and Paul Corley.\n\nHeckerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music has always been eerie, but never this forceful. Some sections of Virgins feel like soundtracks for horror-movie climaxes when the camera fixes on a sickening image and refuses to turn away, fascinated and trapped at the same time. Even the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quieter moments are more tense than they mightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been on HeckerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier albumsÃ¢â‚¬â€a function, maybe, of a live-room environment where every creak and whisper seems to be happening a few feet from the speakers instead of at some artificially cavernous distance.\n\nThis is music that benefits from being heard loud and/or on headphones in the same way couches are best experienced by actually sitting down in them instead of just brushing your fingers against the upholstery as you leave the room. Like a lot of Ben FrostÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s albums (or something like SwansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ The Seer), Virgins feels possessed by the idea that no advancements in society or technology will ever shake our primal reactions to fear, wonder, awe and what in a more naÃƒÂ¯ve era used to be called the sublime. And while itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a fallacy to think that hyperseriousness is the only way to strike people at their core, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still inspiring to hear an artistÃ¢â‚¬â€especially one who started out as mellow as HeckerÃ¢â‚¬â€double down and make a statement so confrontational. Once haunted, now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the one who haunts.
