His mother taught him both Irish and Scottish folk songs as a boy; later, he was influenced by the music of The Beatles and Bob Dylan. He joined the folk-pop group The Humblebums in 1969. After they disbanded in 1971, he recorded his first solo album, Can I Have My Money Back? Rafferty and Joe Egan formed the group Stealers Wheel in 1972, producing several hits, most notably &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot; and &quot;Star&quot;. In 1978, he recorded his second solo album, City to City, which included &quot;Baker Street&quot;, his most popular song.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCity to City is a 1978 album and the second studio album by Scottish singer-songwriter Gerry Rafferty. It was Rafferty's first solo release in six years Ã¢â‚¬â€ and first release of any kind since 1975 Ã¢â‚¬â€ due to his tenure in the band Stealers Wheel and subsequent legal proceedings which prevented Rafferty from releasing any new solo recordings for the next three years. The album was strongly received, peaking at #1 in the US and going Platinum, as well as reaching #6 in the UK and achieving Gold status. &quot;Baker Street&quot;, &quot;Right Down the Line&quot; and &quot;Home and Dry&quot; were successfully released as singles. &quot;Baker Street&quot; is widely regarded as Rafferty's signature song and by October 2010 had reached 5 million plays on British radio.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n\n\nGerry Rafferty: piano, acoustic guitar, vocals, backing vocals\nTommy Eyre: piano, electric piano, grand piano, Moog synthesizer, organ, keyboards, brass arrangements\nJerry Donahue: lead guitar, rhythm guitar, electric guitar on track 1\nHugh Burns: lead guitar, rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar on tracks 2-5, 8-10\nNigel Jenkins: lead guitar, rhythm guitar, electric guitar on tracks 2, 8\nAndy Fairweather-Low: rhythm guitar, electric guitar on track 10\nMicky Moody: acoustic guitar on track 5\nBrian Cole: steel guitar, dobro on tracks 3-6, 9\nGary Taylor: bass, backing vocals on tracks 1-6, 8-10\nGraham Preskett: fiddle, mandolin, synthesizer, string machine, string, bass, arrangements on tracks 1-2, 4-6, 8, 10\nHenry Spinetti: drums on tracks 1-6, 8, 10\nGlen LeFleur: drums, percussion, tambourine on tracks 1-3, 5, 9-10\n\n\nAdditional personnel:\n\n\nBarbara Dickson: backing vocals 1 7\nRaphael Ravenscroft: saxophone 2 9\nRoger Brown: backing vocals 4\nVivian McAuliff: backing vocals 4\nJohn McBurnie: backing vocals 4\nRab Noakes: backing vocals 4\nPaul Jones: harmonica 4\nHugh Murphy: tambourine 4\nWilly Ray: accordion 6 9\nJoanna Carlin: backing vocals 7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4924f083b17eb8b4f69b85247d313c49fb1a7b77","amp;dn":"Gerry+Rafferty+-+City+To+City+%5B2CD%27s%5D%5B1978%5D%5B2011%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BCE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4924f083b17eb8b4f69b85247d313c49fb1a7b77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,36,240,131,177,126,184,180,246,155,133,36,125,49,60,73,251,26,123,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
