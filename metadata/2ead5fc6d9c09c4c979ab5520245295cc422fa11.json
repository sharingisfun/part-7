Well, how exactly did he GET those gems of power? This little gem (pun intended) of a two-shot shows exactly how Thanos was able to secure the jewels one by one, as he uses all of his considerable tools - cunning, intelligence, strength, brutality - to outwit, outlast and simply demolish the Elders of the Universe who stand in his way. It is a great story that shows exactly how ambitious and ruthless Thanos is, while also demonstrating that his exceptional brain is as formidable a weapon as his fist. Jim Starlin writes this wonderful piece and it is beautifully illustrated by the underrated Ron Lim. This feeds directly in the Infinity Trilogy - especially Infinity Gauntlet - and it worth the read if you are interesting in Cosmic Marvel at all. Thanks to Minutemen-InnerDemons for these HD digital copies, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ead5fc6d9c09c4c979ab5520245295cc422fa11","amp;dn":"The+Thanos+Quest+01-02+%281990%2C+Dgtl-HD%2C+Minutemen-InnerD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ead5fc6d9c09c4c979ab5520245295cc422fa11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,173,95,198,217,192,156,76,151,154,181,82,2,69,41,92,196,34,250,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
