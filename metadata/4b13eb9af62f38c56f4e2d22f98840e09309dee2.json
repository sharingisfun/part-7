Even though she followed their tour bus up a slick mountain pass during a blizzard, she never expected to spend an entire snowy night with two generous rock stars who love to share their gifts. Trapped on a tour bus with her best friend, a rock band, and the bus driver, what can these naughty ladies possibly do to keep warm? Perhaps a better question is what won't they do?\n\nTry Me (One Night With Sole Regret #1) by Olivia Cunning (June 2012)\n\nFor the five sexy rock gods of Sole Regret, finding love is easy, keeping it is hard.\nMelanie has no desire to meet the members of the rock band, Sole Regret, but her groupie of a best friend gets them both backstage and then rushes off with the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lead singer. Left alone at an after party with a bunch of scary tattooed and pierced metal-heads, sheltered Melanie is relieved when the only normal-looking guy in the room insists on keeping her company.\nBy the time Melanie discovers that Gabe is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drummer and not as normal as she assumed, she has already made a complete fool of herself. She canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but be interested in him, not as a rock star, but as the sexiest man sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever encountered. Strangely attracted to his hidden tattoos and body piercing, she wonders what it would be like to spend a night with a bad boy.\nGabe is more than willing to show sweet Melanie thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more to him than meets the eye. All she has to do is try him. Will they only share a single night of passion? Or will their hearts entangle as quickly as their bodies?\n\nTempt Me (One Night With Sole Regret #2) by Olivia Cunning (September 2012)\n\n\nTake Me (One Night With Sole Regret #3) by Olivia Cunning (October 2012)\n\n\nTouch Me (One Night With Sole Regret #4) by Olivia Cunning (April 2013)\n\n\nTie Me (One Night with Sole Regret #5) by Olivia Cunning (June 14th 2013)\n\nHis heart is tied to his pastÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nWhen Sole RegretÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rhythm guitarist, Kellen Jamison, vowed to be faithful to his fiancÃƒÂ©e and love her forever, he meant it. He never expected to lose her to cancer so early in life. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certain heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never love again, but destiny has another plan for him.\nHer heart is tied to her workÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nGrammy-winning classical composer and piano virtuoso, Dawn OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly, is overwhelmed with music-writing deadlines, a fickle muse, and high-expectations. She doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have time to find love, but chance seeks to interfere with her carefully devised plans.\nTheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re bound to become entangled...\nFrom the instant Kellen hears DawnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest musical composition, his spirits rise. The stirring melody and the remarkable woman responsible for its creation are impossible to resist. His attraction is undeniable; her passion unquenchable. Kellen teaches Dawn thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s freedom in bondage, while her sensuality drives him to unleash his tightly controlled self-restraint. Will the ropes Kellen uses to secure DawnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body be the force that binds them together or ultimately sever all ties between them?\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b13eb9af62f38c56f4e2d22f98840e09309dee2","amp;dn":"One+Night+With+Sole+Regrets+Series+%28.5-5%29+by+Olivia+Cunning+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b13eb9af62f38c56f4e2d22f98840e09309dee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,19,235,154,246,47,56,197,111,78,45,34,249,136,64,224,147,9,222,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
