Producers include: Robert Stigwood, Arif Mardin, The Bee Gees, Karl Richardson, Abhy Galuten. Compilation producer: Bill Levenson. Recorded between 1966 &amp; 2000. Digitally remastered by Bob Ludwig (Gateway Mastering Studios, Portnad, Maine). The Bee Gees: Maurice Gibb, Robin Gibb, Barry Gibb. Recording information: 1966 - 2000. As any &amp;#039;60s pop aficionado worth his/her salt can tell you, the oft-overlooked Bee Gees where musical visionaries on a par with the Beatles, but until the 2001arrival of this two-disc anthology, their legacy has been ill-treated. Short of buying the box set, previous hits collections made you choose between the brothers Gibb&amp;#039;s early pop-rock period and their subsequent reincarnation as R&amp;B/disco gods. THE RECORD, which devotes a generously proportioned disc to each of these eras, shows that the Bee Gees work in both was equally impressive. From the quirky, death-obsessed, but endlessly melodic invention of such &amp;#039;60s gems as &quot;New York Mining Disaster 1941,&quot; &quot;I&amp;#039;ve Gotta Get a Message to You,&quot; and &quot;I Started a Joke&quot; to the delicious, falsetto-enlivened, faux Philly Soul of &quot;Too Much Heaven&quot; and &quot;Fanny,&quot; through to infectious dance classics &quot;Stayin&amp;#039; Alive&quot; and &quot;Night Fever,&quot; the band stands tall. Their limitless melodic imagination, distinctive three-part harmonies, and consistency of vision mark them as one of the greatest pop outfits of the 20th century, and THEIR GREATEST HITS is far and away the definitive Bee Gees collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dabd05021d77117de2618b73cfe6b09bff164f4a","amp;dn":"BEE+GEES+-+THE+RECORD+-+THEIR+GREATEST+HITS+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dabd05021d77117de2618b73cfe6b09bff164f4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,189,5,2,29,119,17,125,226,97,139,115,207,230,176,155,255,22,79,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
