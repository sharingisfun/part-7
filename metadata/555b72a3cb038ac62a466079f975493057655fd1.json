Williams met in college while residing in Isla Vista, a beach side community in Santa Barbara. Throughout 2004-2005, Rebelution began to build momentum through consistently playing local shows and by independently releasing an EP.\n    \nRebelution released their first full-length album Courage to Grow in June 2007, which would become the breakthrough album for the band. The album was praised for its crafty melodies, socially-conscious lyrics, and savvy musicianship. Courage to Grow went on to garner mass downloads and radio play on stations such as San FranciscoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Live 105 where their single Safe and Sound was played on heavy rotation, with spins on San DiegoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 91X and Los AngelesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s KROQ. The album was selected as iTunes EditorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Choice for Best Reggae Album of 2007. In addition, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCourage to GrowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Top Reggae Albums chart.\n\nTwo years after their last album, Rebelution released their sophomore full-length album Bright Side of Life. On August 4, 2009 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBright Side of LifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was officially released and dominated the iTunes charts, solidifying the 1 spot on iTunes in the reggae music genre, and the 3 spot for top albums downloaded in the United States in all genres of music.
