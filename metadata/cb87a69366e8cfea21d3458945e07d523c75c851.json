Set in 1960, the film center of the young, boyishly handsome Yuddy (Leslie Cheung), who learns from the drunken ex-prostitute who raised him that she is not his real mother. Hoping to hold onto him, she refuses to divulge the name of his real birth mother. The revelation shakes Yuddy to his very core, unleashing a cascade of conflicting emotions. Two women have the bad luck to fall for Yuddy. One is a quiet lass who works at a sport arena named Su Lizhen (Maggie Cheung), while the other is a glitzy showgirl named Mimi (Carina Lau). Perhaps due to his unresolved Oedipal issues, he passively lets the two compete for him, unable or unwilling to make a choice. As Lizhen slowly confides her frustration to a cop named Tide (Andy Lau), he falls for her. The same is true for Yuddy&amp;#039;s friend Zeb (Jacky Cheung), who falls for Mimi. Later, Yuddy learns of his birth mother&amp;#039;s whereabouts and heads out to the Philippines. This film won a armful of trophies at the Hong Kong Film Awards, including Best Director, Best Actor for Leslie Cheung, and Best Picture.\nJonathan Crow\n\nA voice from IMDB\n\nThis is one of the WKW classics, and, imho, is the best I&amp;#039;ve seen. The characters are, as usual, well developed, the dialogs are, as usual, elegant and philosophical, the plot, unlike many other WKW&amp;#039;s movies, is congruent throughout the entire movie, and it is powerful. Leslie Cheung is excellent in this movie; definitely worth the hong kong best actor award he got for this movie. Unfortunately, I wanted to see a better-developed character for Andy Lau&amp;#039;s role, for his role is really interesting as a spectator and a philosopher. Overall the movie is great.\n\nAnd another voice from IMDB\n\nDays of Being Wild is an early film of Wong Ka-wai so many foreign audience neglect this movie in the light of the more-well-known Happy Together and In the Mood For Love. Actually it&amp;#039;s one of the greatest movies by Wong Ka-wai, and a innovative movie of modern Hong Kong cinema. and if you watch Happy Together again after watching Days of Being Wild, I&amp;#039;m sure you will have much obsession with former.\n\nAnd for Leslie&amp;#039;s fans,it&amp;#039;s also a must-see. Leslie Cheung plays a role of Asian James Dean and undoubtedly it turned out to be a successfully-built up image in Hong Kong and Asian Cinema as well. He won a best actor prize for that role. If you have already watch his acclaimed films like Happy Together and Farewell My Concubine, you will surely find it hard to adore or at least appreciate him as an actor who has such all-rounded charisma and versatility.\n\nA Must See!!!!Strongly Recommended. One of the greatest films of Asian Cinema!!!\n\nFile Name .............: A Fei jing juen.Days of Being Wild.1991.Cd2.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 694,476,800 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 46:02.237 (4194264 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: DivX 3 Low-Motion\nFrame Size ............: 640x352 [=1.818]\nFPS ...................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1621 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.300 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: []...[]...[]...[]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 384 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR audio\nInterleave ............: 42 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1\n\nNOT MY RIP     Found along the way on DC++ \n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
