As India starts to prosper, the residents of Annawadi are electric with hope. Abdul, an enterprising teenager, sees Ã¢â‚¬Å“a fortune beyond countingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the recyclable garbage that richer people throw away. Meanwhile Asha, a woman of formidable ambition, has identified a shadier route to the middle class. With a little luck, her beautiful daughter, AnnawadiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“most-everything girl,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ might become its first female college graduate. And even the poorest children, like the young thief Kalu, feel themselves inching closer to their dreams. But then Abdul is falsely accused in a shocking tragedy; terror and global recession rock the city; and suppressed tensions over religion, caste, sex, power, and economic envy turn brutal. With intelligence, humor, and deep insight into what connects people to one another in an era of tumultuous change, Behind the Beautiful Forevers, based on years of uncompromising reporting, carries the reader headlong into one of the twenty-first centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hidden worldsÃ¢â‚¬â€and into the hearts of families impossible to forget. \n \nWinner of the National Book Award | The PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award | The Los Angeles Times Book Prize | The American Academy of Arts and Letters Award | The New York Public LibraryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Helen Bernstein Book Award\n \nNAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY\nThe New York Times Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The Washington Post Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ O: The Oprah Magazine Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ USA Today Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ New York Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The Miami Herald Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ San Francisco Chronicle Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Newsday\n\nAudio CD: 7 pages\nPublisher: Random House Audio; Unabridged edition (February 7, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0307934055\nISBN-13: 978-0307934055\n\nSunil Malhotra (Reader)\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
