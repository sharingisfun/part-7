The band took its name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, which itself was a reference to a William Blake quotation: &quot;If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is,  They were among the most controversial rock acts of the 1960s, due mostly to Morrison's wild, poetic lyrics and charismatic but unpredictable stage persona. After Morrison's death in 1971, the remaining members continued as a trio until finally disbanding in 1973.\n\nTracklist:\n\nThe Doors\n1. Break On Through (To The Other Side)\n2. Soul Kitchen\n3.
