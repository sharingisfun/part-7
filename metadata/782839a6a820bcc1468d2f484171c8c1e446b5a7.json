While Taccone helped his brother and fellow Lonely Islanders Andy Samberg and Akiva Schaffer produce hits like &quot;Dick in a Box,&quot; he found his true collaborator in Compton, whom he met while they were sharing a house in Los Angeles that included Taccone's old friend Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse, as a former resident. While working on Saturday Night Live-affiliated projects such as the Lonely Island songs and the soundtracks to the films Hot Rod and MacGruber, Taccone and Compton also worked on Electric Guest's debut album with Burton, a process that took over six years. The duo's mix of funk, soul, soft rock, disco, and pop came to fruition with Mondo, which arrived in April 2012. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tBecause Music\nCatalog:\t\tBEC 5161137\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.90% CDDA \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Holes\n02.This Head I Hold\n03.Under The Gun\n04.Awake\n05.Amber\n06.The Bait\n07.Waves\n08.Troubleman\n09.American Daydream\n10.Control\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:782839a6a820bcc1468d2f484171c8c1e446b5a7","amp;dn":"Electric+Guest+-+Mondo+2012+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"782839a6a820bcc1468d2f484171c8c1e446b5a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,40,57,166,168,32,188,193,70,141,47,72,65,113,200,193,228,70,181,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
