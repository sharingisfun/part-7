After a six-month long audition process, the band hired teen singer Annabella Lwin Musician David Fishel, originally from Liverpool, an acquaintance of McLaren&amp;#039;s, discovered 14-year-old Lwin while she was working a Saturday job at her local dry cleaning shop. She was singing along to a Stevie Wonder song on the radio. The group&amp;#039;s sound was a mix of her &quot;girlish squeal,&quot; Balinese chants, surf instrumentals, New Romantic pop melodies, and Barbarossa&amp;#039;s Burundi ritual music influenced tom tom drum beats. Among the regular faces at the band&amp;#039;s early London gigs were Latin songwriter/producer Richard Daniel Roman and Boy George, then known as Lieutenant Lush. McLaren was also going to use the latter (later of Culture Club fame) as a second lead singer, but he was deemed to be &quot;too wild&quot; for the band[citation needed]. In 1982, Bow Wow Wow had their first U.K. top 10 hit with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGo Wild in the Country.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The band&amp;#039;s most popular hit was the New Wave staple, &quot;I Want Candy&quot; (originally a 1965 hit by The Strangeloves). &quot;I Want Candy&quot; was featured in an early music video on MTV. Bow Wow Wow&amp;#039;s recording of &quot;I Want Candy&quot; continues to appear in film soundtracks and media and advertising events such as the 2005 Victoria&amp;#039;s Secret Fashion Show. Their most notorious recording was &quot;Sexy Eiffel Towers,&quot; a bold ode to masturbation, including excitedly heavy breathing and orgasmic moans; this was a song that went far beyond the slightly later Cyndi Lauper hit &quot;She Bop&quot;, about similar subject matter.  The group released three full-length albums. In 1983, tensions in the group were rising. Suffering from illness and exhaustion after intense US touring, they went their separate ways.\nControversy\n\nTheir label at the time, EMI, refused to promote the cassingle &quot;C30, C60, C90, Go&quot; because it allegedly promoted home taping,[] as Side B was blank. EMI dropped the group after releasing its second single &quot;W.O.R.K.&quot; \nBow Wow Wow&amp;#039;s take on Le dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©jeuner sur l&amp;#039;herbe\nBow Wow Wow&amp;#039;s take on Le dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©jeuner sur l&amp;#039;herbe\n\nLwin&amp;#039;s mother alleged exploitation of a minor for immoral purposes and instigated a Scotland Yard investigation. As a result the band was only allowed to leave England after McLaren promised not to promote Lwin as a &quot;sex kitten.&quot; This included an agreement to not use a nude photograph depicting Lwin as the woman in Manet&amp;#039;s The Luncheon on the Grass (Le dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©jeuner sur l&amp;#039;herbe), though the picture was used as the cover of an EP in 1982.  (The photo was originally to be used for 1981&amp;#039;s See Jungle!..., and the cover was used as planned in some European countries - such as the Netherlands - though not in the UK or the US.) Lwin was almost made to quit the band by her family over the publication of the photo, particularly as she was only 15 when the photo was taken.\nTRACKS 22-64.2MB@128 KBS\nTRACKLISTING\n1.
