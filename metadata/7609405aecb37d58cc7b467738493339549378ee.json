Living alone since his mid-teens, Bingham shuttled back and forth between Southwestern border towns and relatives' homes, often sleeping in his truck after rodeo shows. It was during those treks that he began entertaining friends with the guitar, an instrument he'd learned at the age of 17 from a mariachi neighbor. Drawing inspiration from Bob Dylan, Marshall Tucker, and Bob Wills -- all of whom populated the jukebox of The Halfway Bar, a roadhouse owned by Bingham's uncle (whose musical tastes influenced those of his nephew) -- Bingham fashioned a road-weary sound that piqued the interest of a barroom proprietor in Stephenville, TX. Bingham was offered a weekly residency at the bar; soon after, he began issuing self-released albums like Lost Bound Rails and Wishbone Saloon. The material was brought to the attention of Nashville heavyweights Lost Highway Records, who signed Bingham and issued his major-label debut, Mescalito (featuring production by Marc Ford, former guitarist for the Black Crowes), in October 2007. \n\n\nGenre................: Country Americana\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Covers, Audiochecker, Accurip Log, Cue\n\n\n01.Nobody Knows My Trouble\n02.Broken Heart Tattoos\n03.Top Shelf Drug\n04.Island In The Sky\n05.Adventures Of You And Me\n06.Fear And Saturday Night\n07.My Diamond Is Too Rough\n08.Radio\n09.Snow Falls In June\n10.Darlin\n11.Hands Of Time\n12.Gun Fightin Man\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7609405aecb37d58cc7b467738493339549378ee","amp;dn":"Ryan+Bingham+-+Fear+And+Saturday+Night+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7609405aecb37d58cc7b467738493339549378ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,9,64,90,236,179,125,88,204,123,70,119,56,73,51,57,84,147,120,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
