It was in a practice studio situated in MontrealÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mile-End district, through the hardships of time constraints and flatlined bank accounts, that the trio bonded and created their unique sound, fusing together the restless elements of indie, pop and folk with beautiful rhythmic harmonies, delicate guitar lines and a hint of warm electronica.\n\n\nArmed with solid training and raw talent, they mix and combine their different musical backgrounds. Their complex arrangements, inspired by both classical and modern composers, are particularly striking to hear and see during their live shows. Devon PortieljeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remarkable voice is beautifully backed up by Connor Molander and Dylan Phillips. Phillips often plays drums and keys simultaneously as Molander and Portielje shuffle between guitar, keys, samplers, and percussion folky three-part harmonies hold down moody, psychedelic arrangements and electronic-infused soundscapes.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://halfmoonrun.indica.mu/en/music/half-moon-run-dark-eyes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://halfmoonrun.indica.mu/en/music/half-moon-run-dark-eyes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHALF MOON RUN\nDARK EYES\n2012\n\n01.Full Circle\n02.Call Me in the Afternoon\n03.No More Losing the War\n04.She Wants to Know\n05.Need It06.Give Up\n07.Judgement\n08.Drug You\n09.Nerve\n10.Fire Escape\n11.21 Gun Salute\n\n\nIf you enjoy them, please buy their music or see a show!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:102a9c0db1562a4dccc87ce49aa9450685bc3185","amp;dn":"Half+Moon+Run+-+Dark+Eyes+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D-insinuendo+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"102a9c0db1562a4dccc87ce49aa9450685bc3185","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,42,156,13,177,86,42,77,204,200,124,228,154,169,69,6,133,188,49,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
