(1960, originally released on Capitol) and Ole a la Lee (1960, also originally released on Capitol) - by Peggy Lee on one compact disc.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/img641/3019/frontgtn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/img641/3019/frontgtn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n1. Latin Ala Lee!\n\n\nMore than a decade after her massive hit &quot;Manana,&quot; Peggy Lee recorded a full album of Latin themes with Latin ala Lee!. The subtitle -- &quot;Broadway hits styled with an Afro-Cuban beat&quot; -- sounds not only forced, but a bit too gimmicky to be worth much more than the cardboard it's printed on. Also, none of the musicians are credited, and only a clueless marketing man would write the note on the back cover, &quot;Accompanied by authentic Afro-Cuban rhythms.&quot; Even so, Peggy Lee's mastery over a range of stylistic situations rescues any potential miscues, and the rugged backing of arranger/conductor Jack Marshall is a pleasant surprise. The rhythms are not only authentically Afro-Cuban, but surprisingly strong and rarely watered down. The rest of the arrangements, though breezy and pop-slanted, support Lee's vocals perfectly. And though her voice isn't quite as strong as it had been during the '50s, Lee uses the cracks on her high notes to accentuate the songs. Out of print for many years, EMI-Capitol brought the album back in 2000 on a CD issue with remarkably clear stereo separation, though there are slight, occasional imperfections that would have been barely noticeable if not for the immaculate sound which surrounds them.

Ole Ala Lee!\n\n\nVelvety flutes, peppy percussion, well-behaved brass -- yes, the stage is set once more for Peggy Lee's sedately suggestive Latin musings. Seemingly ghost-written in George Shearing's ultra-lounge hand, this sequel to the singer's Latin ala Lee! album offers another enchanting mix of jazz-vocal staples (&quot;Come Dance with Me,&quot; &quot;You Stepped Out of a Dream&quot;) and Broadway-issue mambo (&quot;Fantastico,&quot; &quot;Non Dimencticar&quot;). Never fear the drip-drip of gloss in extremis, though, for Lee always distinguishes the Cuban-lite environs with her throaty ballad tone and unerring rhythmic sense. Arranger and conductor Joe Harnell does let the Latin fire loose a bit (&quot;From Now On&quot;), but generally things remain on auto glide. A perfect backdrop for your next tiki-torch affair, this harmless conga turn -- while certainly not essential -- is sure to be eaten up by all of Lee's adoring fans. (AMG)\n\n\n\n13.
