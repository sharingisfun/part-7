It was praised by the New York Times as â€œa powerful allegory of our civilizationâ€™s many maladies, artfully and elegantly articulated, by one of the young wise women of our generation.â€\r\nIn her second book, a collection of twelve stories irresistibly seductive in their strangeness, she explores human life from beginning to end: the distress of birth into a world already formed; the brief and confusing period of â€œlivingâ€ where we understand what is expected of us and struggle to do it; and the death-y period toward the end where we sense it is ending and will end only partially understood, at best.\r\nThe title is taken from one of the stories (â€œIntimationâ€), but is also a play on Wordsworthâ€™s â€œIntimations of Immortalityâ€â€”only in this case itâ€™s not clear exactly what is being intimated, but itâ€™s nothing so gleaming and good as Immortality. The middle, â€œLivingâ€ section of the book, is fleshed out with a set of stories that borrow more from traditional realist fiction to illustrate the inner lives of the characters.\r\nAt once familiar and mysterious, these stories have an eerie resonance as its characters find themselves in new and surprising situations. An unnamed woman enters a room with no exit and a ready-made life; the disappearance of people, objects, and memory creates an apocalypse; the art of dance is used to try to tame a feral child; the key to surviving a house-party lies in knowing the difference between fake and real blood.\r\nElegant, surprising, wondrous, and haunting, Intimations is an utterly transporting collection from one of our most ingenious and brilliant young writers.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6743bd928955bffe927a81d5eb4cc81ad30dc342","amp;dn":"Intimations-Stories+-+Alexandra+Kleeman+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6743bd928955bffe927a81d5eb4cc81ad30dc342","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,67,189,146,137,85,191,254,146,122,129,213,235,76,200,26,211,13,195,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
