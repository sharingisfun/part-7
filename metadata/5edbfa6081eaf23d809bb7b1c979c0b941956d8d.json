A former business associate from Berlin's underworld pays a call asking Ripley's help in killing a rival. Ripley - ever a student of human nature - initiates a game to turn a mild and innocent local picture framer into a hit man. The artisan, Jonathan Trevanny, who's dying of cancer, has a wife, young son, and little to leave them. If Ripley draws Jonathan into the game, can Ripley maintain control? Does it stop at one killing? What if Ripley develops a conscience? Luisa prepares for her concert.\n\n\nReview From IMDB\n\nThis was good; a solid crime story. It's the &quot;Tom Ripley&quot; of &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley,&quot; but now older and being played by John Malkovich instead of Matt Damon. He's also, at least to me, a totally different character so this story stands on its own. There's no tie-in to that previous film\n\nMalkovich plays his normal role, playing the kind of character he's good at playing: the smart, sarcastic and sadistic villain with the interesting vocabulary. In this story, he blends in with the locals as somewhat of a nondescript guy but inside he's a man with no conscience who is a killer. Late in the film, he admits and brags about having no conscience.\n\nThe plot in this movie revolves around Ripley having someone else do some of the latest killings for him, an &quot;average Joe&quot; that no one would suspect. That role is played by Dougray Scott, a young Englishman with a wife and young son, but a man who is dying of leukemia and could use a little extra money for his family when he's gone. That seems to be the lure when the evil Ripley and his partner give him the murder sales pitch. It takes some convincing, but &quot;Jonathan Trevanny&quot; eventually gives in to some persuasion, shall we say. Scott's reaction after the killing is very interesting...and he gets another assignment.\n\nRipley's partner &quot;Reeves&quot; also is an intriguing guy, played by Ray Winstone who also often portrays this time of character: a vicious, profane thug. If you saw &quot;Sexy Beast,&quot; you'll know the type of guy Winstone plays here\n\nAnyway,without giving the story away, suffice to say this wound up a pleasant surprise: great dialog, good photography and acting, some dark humor along with good suspense and just the right amount of action and lulls. It is heavy on the profanity, so beware of that.\n\nThis is a film one doesn't hear much about and is recommended for those who enjoy modern-day, tough crime films.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5edbfa6081eaf23d809bb7b1c979c0b941956d8d","amp;dn":"Ripleys+Game+-+%28Ray+Winstone+-+John+Malkovich%29%282002%29%5BDvdRip-DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5edbfa6081eaf23d809bb7b1c979c0b941956d8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,219,250,96,129,234,242,61,128,155,183,177,201,121,192,185,65,149,109,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
