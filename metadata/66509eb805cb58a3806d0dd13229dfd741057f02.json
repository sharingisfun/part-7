It can be found in the Phoenix system of the Argos Rho cluster.\n\nPinnacle Station is asteroid-based -- close to the planet Vebinok -- and was originally constructed by the turians to function as a concealed command center during the Krogan Rebellions. It was later retrofitted as a military training facility by the Citadel for highly-skilled special operations teams employed by the Council.\n\nThe combat simulator allows for training under a variety of hazardous conditions, and promising competitors from all races attend by invitation only. The station has a radius of 340m and a working population of 1200, and is currently commanded by the Systems Alliance Admiral Ahern. \n\nInstallation:\n\nJust put the folder with the downloaded content inside DLC folder that is located in the main directory of the game.\n\nIn order for it to work you need an updated exe file that came with Bring Down The Sky (that you propably already have).\nIt is recommended to have patch 1.02 installed.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n---YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT IF YOU HAVE THE WHOLE MOD WITHOUT SERIAL ALREADY!!!---\n\n\nIF you already downloaded the .exe version of Pinnacle Station that asks for serial from another source, you DO NOT have to download this package, just use 7-zip to extract the files from $[31] folder - there you have DLC folder - just copy what's inside into DLC folder inside main directory of the game. \nNEXT STEP - copy autoload.ini file from Bring Down The Sky (Mass Effect-&gt; DLC -&gt; DLC_UNC folder) to Mass Effect -&gt; DLC -&gt; DLC_Vegas and make it look like this:\n(posted by EvilDick777)\nFixed autoload.ini:\n\n[Packages]\n2DA1=BIOG_2DA_Vegas_GalaxyMap_X\n2DA2=BIOG_2DA_Vegas_Merge_X\n2DA3=BIOG_2DA_Vegas_AreaMap_X\n2DA4=BIOG_2DA_Vegas_UI_X\n2DA5=BIOG_2DA_Vegas_TreasureTables_X\n\nDotU1=PlotManagerDLC_Vegas\nPlotManagerConditionals1=PlotManagerDLC_Vegas.BioAutoConditionals\nPlotManagerStateTransitionMap1=PlotManagerAutoDLC_Vegas.StateTransitionMap\nPlotManagerConsequenceMap1=PlotManagerAutoDLC_Vegas.ConsequenceMap\nPlotManagerOutcomeMap1=PlotManagerAutoDLC_Vegas.OutcomeMap\nPlotManagerQuestMap1=PlotManagerAutoDLC_Vegas.QuestMap\nPlotManagerCodexMap1=PlotManagerAutoDLC_Vegas.DataCodexMap\nGlobalTalkTable1=DLC_Vegas_GlobalTlk.GlobalTlk_tlk\nGlobalTalkTable1_ES=DLC_Vegas_GlobalTlk_ES.GlobalTlk_tlk\n\n\n[GUI]\nNameStrRef=182170\nDescriptionStrRef=182171\nImagePackage=&quot;GUI_SF_PRC2_SaveLoad.Images_PRC2&quot;\nImageFrame=&quot;shotOne&quot;\nCreditsFile=&quot;BIOCredits_DLC_Vegas.ini&quot;\n\n.!\n.!\n.!\n\nEVEN IF YOU DOWNLOD THIS TORRENT, EDIT Mass Effect-&gt;DLC-&gt;DLC_Vegas-&gt;autoload.ini file and make it look like above!\n.!\n.!\n.!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66509eb805cb58a3806d0dd13229dfd741057f02","amp;dn":"Mass+Effect%3A+Pinnacle+Station","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66509eb805cb58a3806d0dd13229dfd741057f02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,80,158,184,5,203,88,163,128,109,13,209,50,41,223,215,65,5,127,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
