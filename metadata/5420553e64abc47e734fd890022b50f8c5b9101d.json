Did you see Super Size Me ? Then guess what ... You've been fed a load of bologna. Comedian and former health writer Tom Naughton replies to the Super Size Me crowd by losing weight on a fat-laden fast-food diet including plenty of double quarter-pounders and fried chicken while demonstrating that nearly everything we've been told about obesity and healthy eating is wrong. Fat Head features humorous animations as well as informative interviews with doctors, nutritionists, and political scientists.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5420553e64abc47e734fd890022b50f8c5b9101d","amp;dn":"Fat+Head+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5420553e64abc47e734fd890022b50f8c5b9101d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,32,85,62,100,171,196,126,115,79,216,144,2,43,80,248,197,185,16,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
