Nora's in her 30s and has loved four men - her son Elias, Elias's deceased father, her own father, and IsmaÃƒÂ«l, a musician given to odd behavior with whom she lived seven years. She will soon marry a businessman. Faced with her father's death, Nora seeks out IsmaÃƒÂ«l to ask that he reconnect with Elias; a great deal else roils from her past. IsmaÃƒÂ«l has his own challenges, not the least of which are his feelings toward adopting Elias and his meeting Arielle, another patient. IsmaÃƒÂ«l's surface shows a lot; Nora's, very little.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3013208aa213c8810e689ebd95421b6c20da3742","amp;dn":"Rois+et+Reine+aka+Kings+and+Queen+2004+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3013208aa213c8810e689ebd95421b6c20da3742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,19,32,138,162,19,200,129,14,104,158,189,149,66,27,108,32,218,55,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
