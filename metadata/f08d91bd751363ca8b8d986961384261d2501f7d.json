It is a version of the Latin Mass based on traditional Congolese songs, arranged by Father Guido Haazen, a Franciscan Friar from Belgium, and originally performed and recorded in 1958 by &quot;Les Troubadours du Roi Baudouin&quot;, a choir of Congolese children from Kamina. The recording includes the mass as well as traditional songs.\n\n\nMore - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missa_Luba\n\nStuds Terkel's essay on this recording - &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://people.virginia.edu/~pm9k/gifs/ZoForth/missaluba.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://people.virginia.edu/~pm9k/gifs/ZoForth/missaluba.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy... and please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f08d91bd751363ca8b8d986961384261d2501f7d","amp;dn":"Missa+Luba","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f08d91bd751363ca8b8d986961384261d2501f7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,141,145,189,117,19,99,202,139,141,152,105,97,56,66,97,210,80,31,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
