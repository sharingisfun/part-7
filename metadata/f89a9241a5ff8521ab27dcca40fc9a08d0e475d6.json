In Iray, the lights in the wall and ceiling light the scene!\r\n\r\nSimple but elegant, you simply load the scene, load your character, light, and shoot. The smaller scene means less memory and CPU overhead. The floor and wall are individually UV unwrapped and each of the components can be loaded and rearranged to suit your needs.\r\n\r\nThe set includes a preload assembling each of the elements of the corridor: ceiling, floor, end wall, left wall, and right wall, along with individual files for the pallet and the crate with removable lid.\r\n \nhttps://pximg.xyz/images/5cc9c02a0c8e9ceef53e7b08fad9d36d.jpg\r\n\r\nwww.daz3d.com/catalog/product/view/id/23787","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f89a9241a5ff8521ab27dcca40fc9a08d0e475d6","amp;dn":"DAZ3D+Collective3d+Portrait+Vignettes+Sci-Fi+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f89a9241a5ff8521ab27dcca40fc9a08d0e475d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,154,146,65,165,255,133,33,171,39,220,202,64,252,154,8,208,228,117,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
