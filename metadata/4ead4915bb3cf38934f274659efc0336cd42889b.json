It's all about the Blues - Chicago-Style Blues, Delta-Style Blues, Progressive Blues and Blues-Rock. This is where it's at for Johnny. It's all about &quot;gettin' the feelin' out - telling the story and lettin' the house really know how the soul feels about it.&quot;\n\nGuitar is the voice along with Johnny's vocals. &quot;There's nothin' better than a wailin' guitar for gettin' the point across,&quot; says Johnny. &quot;Speak for Yourself&quot; is the title track. After getting one's attention, it's a shuffle that let's everyone know how he feels about where the relationship's going. &quot;Whisper,&quot; &quot;I'd a Held the Door&quot; and &quot;Take Out the Garbage&quot; keep the Blues in the forefront. &quot;Time to Fly,&quot; &quot;The Same&quot; and &quot;Up One Side &amp; Down the Other&quot; let some progressive syle come to the Blues along with some Blues-Rock spice. &quot;Mo Blue,&quot; Ice Storm Blues&quot; and &quot;Bridge Down the Road&quot; keep the Blues feeling focused from the soul.\nTag Cloud\n\n\n\nTracks:\n-------\n01.
