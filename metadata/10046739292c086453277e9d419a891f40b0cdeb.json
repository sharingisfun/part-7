Signed to the label in 1994, he produced his debut, Tempest, one year later. Gravity, released in 1996, hit the Top Ten on the new age charts. Two years following, Vertigo was released and Free Fall appeared in mid-2000. In 2003 Nomad came out, followed by the live album MontrÃƒÂ©al in 2004. Though it was started conceptually in 2005, Cook didn't issue his next studio album, Frontiers, which marked a return to his initial simpler production style, until 2007.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Mario Takes A Walk\n02.Air\n03.Paloma\n04.Byzantium Underground\n05.Baghdad\n06.Surrender\n07.Switchback\n08.Brio\n09.Red\n10.Early On Tuesday\n11.Breeze From Saintes Maries\n12.Breathing Below Surface\n13.Closer To Madnes (Live)\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.That's Right!\n02.Tempest\n03.Rattle And Burn\n04.Azul\n05.Gravity\n06.Fall At Your Feet\n07.Dance Of Spring\n08.Into The Dark\n09.On Walks The Night\n10.Gipsy\n11.Waiting For Tide\n12.Cascada\n13.Toca Orilla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
