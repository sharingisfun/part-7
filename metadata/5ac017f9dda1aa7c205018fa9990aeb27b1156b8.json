He produced the debut album by the group Family, containing in its ranks future Traffic bass player Ric Grech, while Traffic went on the road. In May, the band had invited Mason back to begin recording the new album.\n\nMason ended up writing and singing half of the songs on the album (including his biggest hit &quot;Feelin' Alright?&quot;), but making scant contribution to the songs written by Jim Capaldi and Steve Winwood. His flair for pop melody had always been at odds with the others' jazz ambitions, evidenced by the dichotomy seen for the songs on this album, and by October he was again out of the band. He would return one more time for a tour and album in 1971 to run out the band's contract.\n\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3] [2008 Japanese SHM-CD]\n\n    &quot;You Can All Join In&quot; (Mason) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:34\n       \n    &quot;Pearly Queen&quot; (Capaldi/Winwood) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:20\n        \n    &quot;Don't Be Sad&quot; (Mason) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:24\n       \n    &quot;Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring&quot; (Capaldi/Winwood/Wood)[note 1] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:11\n       \n    &quot;Feelin' Alright?&quot; (Mason) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:16\n       \n    &quot;Vagabond Virgin&quot; (Capaldi/Mason) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:21\n       \n    &quot;(Roamin' Thru the Gloamin' with) 40,000 Headmen&quot; (Capaldi/Winwood) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:15\n       \n    &quot;Cryin' to Be Heard&quot; (Mason) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:14\n       \n    &quot;No Time to Live&quot; (Capaldi/Winwood) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:10\n       \n    &quot;Means to an End&quot; (Capaldi/Winwood) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:39\n       \n\nBONUS TRACKS\n\n    &quot;You Can All Join In&quot; (Mason) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:45 [mono single mix]\n    &quot;|Feelin' Alright?&quot; (Mason) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:03 [mono single mix]\n    &quot;Withering Tree&quot; (Capaldi/Winwood) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:53 [stereo single mix]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ac017f9dda1aa7c205018fa9990aeb27b1156b8","amp;dn":"Traffic+-+Traffic+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ac017f9dda1aa7c205018fa9990aeb27b1156b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,192,23,249,221,161,170,124,32,80,24,250,153,144,174,178,123,17,86,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
