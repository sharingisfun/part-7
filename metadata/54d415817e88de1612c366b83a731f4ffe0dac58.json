New filter and effects capabilities include:\n\n- Color Shadow: Creates a high contrast image overlayed with a gradient, simulating the look and feel of those colorful iPodÃ‚Â® commercials.\n\n- DeBand: Removes banding artifacts from an image by smoothing pixels in banded areas while retaining detail. Banding frequently occurs, in blue skies for instance, with DSLRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as well as digital cameras. DeBand effectively smooths out this unwanted banding\n.\n- DeBlock: Removes blocking artifacts created as a result of high compression factors, such as overly compressed JPG images which often cause square blocking artifacts.\n\n- DeNoise: Grain and noise from digital cameras, whether still or video, is a common problem. DeNoise removes the grain and noise while still retaining detail.\n\n- Film Stocks: Simulates 113 different color and black &amp; white photographic film stocks. For those desiring the look of either old or current film stocks, there are simulations of many of the popular brands from KodakÃ‚Â®, FujiÃ‚Â®, AgfaÃ‚Â®, PolaroidÃ‚Â®, and IlfordÃ‚Â®.\n\n- Glow Darks: Glows and grows the dark areas of an image, creating a stylized, dreamy dark glow.\n\n- Key Light: Relights images with a directional or point light. Changing the lighting after an image has been photographed gives the photographer/editor control to fix or enhance their images, as well as create interesting lighting effects.\n\n- Rays: Creates stunning and realistic light ray effects quickly and easily. Rays can add shafts of light streaming through clouds, rays filtering through a forest canopy, beams of light on a foggy night, or rays shooting through an interior window. Rays adds a striking and dramatic quality to any image.\n\n- Texture: Applies textures to an image for a stylized look. Adding texture to an image is a great way to create a unique and customized look.\n\n- Match: Matches the color, detail, gradient, and tone of one image and applies it to another.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/72551138484408608055.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/72551138484408608055.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54d415817e88de1612c366b83a731f4ffe0dac58","amp;dn":"Tiffen+Dfx+3.0.10.4+%28x32%2Fx64%29+%5BMulti%5D%5BPortable%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54d415817e88de1612c366b83a731f4ffe0dac58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,212,21,129,126,136,222,22,18,195,102,184,58,115,31,79,254,13,172,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
