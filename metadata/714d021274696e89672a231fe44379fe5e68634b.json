Fear. Sadness. Dr. Judith Orloff sees people every day who are struggling with these overwhelming emotions. To help us find relief, she has created Emotional Freedom Practices. This two-CD toolkit expands on the insights from her recently released New York Times bestseller Emotional Freedom, featured in a new public television special. Listeners will discover how to turn away from negativity, react constructively, and seize command of any life situation.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the key to finding liberation from negativity? Dr. Orloff teaches that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how we choose to respond to external events that determines our experience. Drawing from the fields of biology, psychology, and intuitive medicine, Dr. Orloff offers exercises, self-care techniques, and meditations that help transform fear into courage, disappointment into patience, and anger into compassion.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Achieving emotional freedom gives you access to your own power center during jubilant times and in adversity,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ teaches Orloff. Emotional Freedom Practices is a program in self-mastery that will help anyone attain a high-quality life, handle stress artfully, and find serenityÃ¢â‚¬â€even in the most overwhelming situations.\n\nMP3 - 128 kbps - CBR\n\n150 min approx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:714d021274696e89672a231fe44379fe5e68634b","amp;dn":"Emotional+Freedom+Practices+with+Judith+Orloff+%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"714d021274696e89672a231fe44379fe5e68634b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,77,2,18,116,105,110,137,103,42,35,31,228,67,121,254,94,104,99,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
