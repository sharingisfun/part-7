The first reference of its kind, this book contains contributions from influential scholars in North America and Europe. The essays use a variety of analytic approaches to study all aspects of ScorseseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work, from his earliest films to his place within the history of American and world cinema. They consider his work in relation to auteur theory, the genres in which he has worked, his use of popular music, and his recent involvement with film preservation. Several of the essays offer fresh interpretations of some of ScorseseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most influential films, including Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Gangs of New York, and Hugo. Others take a broader approach and discuss the representation of violence, ethnicity, religion, sexuality, gender, race, and other themes across his work. With insights that will interest film scholars as well as movie enthusiasts, this is an important contribution to the scholarship of contemporary American cinema","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b04b554c39724a6c6255e40f16d9c5b36872a1b","amp;dn":"%5BAaron+Baker%5D+A+Companion+to+Martin+Scorsese+%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b04b554c39724a6c6255e40f16d9c5b36872a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,4,181,84,195,151,36,166,198,37,94,64,241,109,156,91,54,135,42,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
