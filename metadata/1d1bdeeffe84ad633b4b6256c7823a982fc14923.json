The record included primarily the style of glam metal, with much of it re-worked versions of demos Vincent recorded in 1982.\r\n\r\nFleischman exited the band during a contract dispute. Next with new vocalist Mark Slaughter now on board, the band released their second album, All Systems Go in May 1988. \r\nThe album featured one of the group's best-known hits, &quot;Ashes to Ashes,&quot; and &quot;Love Kills,&quot; which appeared on the A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master soundtrack.\r\nLater in 1988, the band was released from their contract with Chrysalis Records. Having grown annoyed with what they perceived to be Vincent's domination of the project, Slaughter and Strum left to form the band Slaughter. And that was that.\r\n\r\nStyle:\tGlam Rock\r\n\r\nCountry: USA\r\n\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\nSize:\t222.28 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t01/01/2016\r\nFiles:\t25\r\n\r\n\r\nLast seeded:\t01/01/2016 09:46:37\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\n\r\nDiscography\r\n\r\n    \r\nVinnie Vincent Invasion (1986)\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;Boyz Are Gonna Rock&quot;   \tVinnie Vincent \t4:54\r\n2. \t&quot;Shoot U Full of Love&quot;   \tVinnie Vincent \t4:44\r\n3. \t&quot;No Substitute&quot;   \tVinnie Vincent \t3:52\r\n4. \t&quot;Animal&quot;   \tVinnie Vincent \t5:33\r\n5. \t&quot;Twisted&quot;   \tVinnie Vincent \t4:49\r\n6. \t&quot;Do You Wanna Make Love&quot;   \tVinnie Vincent, Robert Fleischman \t3:23\r\n7. \t&quot;Back on the Streets&quot;   \tVinnie Vincent, Richard Friedman \t4:50\r\n8. \t&quot;I Wanna Be Your Victim&quot;   \tVinnie Vincent \t4:36\r\n9. \t&quot;Baby-O&quot;   \tVinnie Vincent \t3:43\r\n10. \t&quot;Invasion&quot;   \tVinnie Vincent, Robert Fleischman \t7:50\r\n\r\nPersonnel 1986\r\n\r\n    Robert Fleischman - vocals\r\n    Vinnie Vincent - guitars, vocals\r\n    Dana Strum - bass, backing vocals\r\n    Bobby Rock - drums\r\n \r\n \r\nAll Systems Go (1988)\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\nAll songs written by Vinnie Vincent.\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tLength\r\n1. \t&quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;   \t5:05\r\n2. \t&quot;Dirty Rhythm&quot;   \t3:38\r\n3. \t&quot;Love Kills&quot;   \t5:36\r\n4. \t&quot;Naughty Naughty&quot;   \t3:30\r\n5. \t&quot;Burn&quot;   \t4:38\r\n6. \t&quot;Let Freedom Rock&quot;   \t4:44\r\n7. \t&quot;That Time of Year&quot;   \t4:11\r\n8. \t&quot;Heavy Pettin'&quot;   \t4:38\r\n9. \t&quot;Ecstasy&quot;   \t4:40\r\n10. \t&quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;   \t4:02\r\n11. \t&quot;Breakout&quot;   \t2:01\r\n\r\nPersonnel 1988\r\n\r\n    Mark Slaughter - lead vocals\r\n    Vinnie Vincent - lead guitar, backing vocals\r\n    Dana Strum - bass guitar, backing vocals\r\n    Bobby Rock - drums\r\n\r\nAdditional personnel\r\n\r\n    Jeff Scott Soto - backing vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d1bdeeffe84ad633b4b6256c7823a982fc14923","amp;dn":"Vinnie+Vincent+Invasion+Discography+1986-88++320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d1bdeeffe84ad633b4b6256c7823a982fc14923","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,27,222,239,254,132,173,99,59,75,98,86,199,130,58,152,47,193,73,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
