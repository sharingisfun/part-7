The performances fall generally into the medium-tempo range, with Ellis scattering some witty song quotes throughout the lightly swinging renditions. The high points include one of the more delightful versions ever of Johnny Mandel's &quot;Emily,&quot; some close interplay during &quot;Little Niles&quot; and a tongue-in-cheek version of &quot;Limehouse Blues&quot; that includes slapped bass, parade rhythms and Marsalis trying in vain to sound Dixielandish. One programming error should be noted: there is no such song as &quot;Just Squeeze Me&quot; and, rather than the one performed being Fats Waller's &quot;Squeeze Me,&quot; it is actually Duke Ellington's &quot;Squeeze Me, But Please Don't Tease Me.&quot; (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Syndrome\n02 - Emily\n03 - Just Squeeze Me\n04 - Little Niles\n05 - Limehouse Blues\n06 - A Moment Alone\n07 - Lil' Boy Man\n08 - Jitterbug Waltz\n09 - The Garden\n10 - Chapter One\n11 - I Thought About You\n\nEnjoy and share!
