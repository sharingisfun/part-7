Furtado always proudly displayed her Portuguese heritage, a distinction that separated her from legions of emerging female singer/songwriters in the early days of the new millennium, but her uniqueness didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t cease there: she had an ear for elliptical yet memorable melodies, a taste for Brit-pop balanced by an immersion in modern R&amp;B and hip-hop. All this surfaced on Whoa, Nelly! and its hits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTurn Off the LightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Like a Bird,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but she really pushed her rhythmic influences to the forefront on Loose, resulting in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPromiscuousÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMan Eater,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ her biggest hits to date, and suggesting that Furtado had many avenues yet to explore.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.
