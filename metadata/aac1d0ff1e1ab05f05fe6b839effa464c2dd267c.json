Two parallel and intercut stories dramatize men about to die: both are estranged from a grown child, both want to make contact, and neither child wants anything to do with dad. Earl Partridge's son is a charismatic misogynist; Jimmy Gator's daughter is a cokehead and waif. A mild and caring nurse intercedes for Earl, reaching the son; a prayerful and upright beat cop meets the daughter, is attracted to her, and leads her toward a new calm. Meanwhile, guilt consumes Earl's young wife, while two whiz kids, one grown and a loser and the other young and pressured, face their situations.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAVI File\n\nWidth: 640\nHight: 272\nFramerate: 23 f/ps\nAudio: 124 kbps\nLength: 03:05:31\nGenre: Drama\nTagline: Things fall down.
