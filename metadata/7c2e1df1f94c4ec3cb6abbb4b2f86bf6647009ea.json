So his wife (Nicoletta Braschi) comes up with a plan to find a guy who looks like Toothpick Johnny, so the gangsters will kill him instead.\n\nHilarity ensues. I hardcoded it with English subtitles, all in one file, an .avi file. Enjoy. And, as always, don't forget to seeeeeed. Roberto Benigni gets so many awards for the films he writes/directs, mostly comedies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c2e1df1f94c4ec3cb6abbb4b2f86bf6647009ea","amp;dn":"Johnny+Stecchino+%28R+Benigni+hardcoded+English+subs%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c2e1df1f94c4ec3cb6abbb4b2f86bf6647009ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,46,29,241,249,76,78,195,203,106,187,180,178,248,107,246,100,112,9,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
