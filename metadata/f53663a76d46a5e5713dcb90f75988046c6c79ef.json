This isn't your retarded classical top 100 mozart collection, this is real repertoire.\n\nAll of the preludes and piano sonatas are here, as well as other miscellaneous pieces.\n\nEncoded in FLAC compression-level 5.\n\n\n\n**Tagging is done as follows:\nArtist == Composer\nAlbum == Name of the work\nTitle == Title of a part or movement in a work\nGenre == The performer(s)\nTrack == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.\n\nI've done filenames as &quot;%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title&quot;\n\n\n\nIf there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f53663a76d46a5e5713dcb90f75988046c6c79ef","amp;dn":"Classical+Music+-+Scriabin+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f53663a76d46a5e5713dcb90f75988046c6c79ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,54,99,167,109,70,165,229,113,61,203,144,247,89,136,4,108,108,121,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
