This supports the artists, who work so hard.\n\nDescription:\n\nWarning: You may have a huge, invisible spider living in your skull. This is not a metaphor.\nYou will dismiss this as ridiculous fearmongering. Dismissing things as ridiculous fearmongering is, in fact, the first symptom of parasitic spider infection - the creature secretes a chemical into the brain to stimulate skepticism, in order to prevent you from seeking a cure. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just as well, since the Ã¢â‚¬Å“cureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ involves learning what a chain saw tastes like. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel the spider, because it controls your nerve endings. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see it, because it decides what you see. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even feel it when it breeds. And it will breed. So what happens when your family, friends, and neighbors get mind-controlling skull spiders? WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all about to find out.\nJust stay calm, and remember that telling you about the spider situation is not the same as having caused it. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just the messenger. Even if I did sort of cause it. Either way, I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hold it against you if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re upset. I know thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the spider talking.\n\nÃ‚Â©2012 David Wong (P)2012 Brilliance Audio, Inc. \n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:123431e77cf7f957277f41159ce69d1fe11111d9","amp;dn":"This+Book+is+Full+of+Spiders+%28Unabridged%29+by+David+Wong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"123431e77cf7f957277f41159ce69d1fe11111d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,52,49,231,124,247,249,87,39,127,65,21,156,230,157,31,225,17,17,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
