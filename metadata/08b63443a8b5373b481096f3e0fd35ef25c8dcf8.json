Common examples range from soap bubbles, foam, and raindrops to cosmetics, paint, adhesives, and pharmaceuticals. Additional areas that rely on surface chemistry include modern nanotechnology, medical diagnostics, and drug delivery. There is extensive literature on this subject, but most chemistry books only devote one or two chapters to it. Surface Chemistry Essentials fills a need for a reference that brings together the fundamental aspects of surface chemistry with up-to-date references and data from real-world examples.\n\nThis book enables readers to better understand many natural phenomena and industrial processes. Mathematical treatment is mainly given as references to make the material accessible to individuals with a broader range of scientific backgrounds. The book begins by introducing basic considerations with respect to liquid and solid surfaces and describes forces in curved versus flat liquid surfaces. Chapters cover properties of surface active substances, such as surfactants and soaps; lipid films and Langmuir-Blodgett films; and adsorption and desorption on solid surfaces. \n\nThe author discusses processes involved in liquidÃ¢â‚¬â€œsolid interface phenomena, which are utilized in washing, coatings, lubrication, and more, and colloid chemistry systems and related industrial applications such as waste water treatment. The author also addresses bubbles, films, and foams and the principles of oilÃ¢â‚¬â€œwater emulsion science, used in detergents, paints, and skin creams. The final chapter considers more complex applications, for example, food emulsions, scanning probe microscopy, the cement industry, and gas and oil recovery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08b63443a8b5373b481096f3e0fd35ef25c8dcf8","amp;dn":"Surface+Chemistry+Essentials%2C+2013+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08b63443a8b5373b481096f3e0fd35ef25c8dcf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,182,52,67,168,181,55,59,72,16,150,243,224,253,53,239,37,200,220,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
