Steven Spielberg was one of the executive producers, in his role as founder of the Shoah Foundation. The film tells the stories of five Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust. It focuses on the horrors of life in the concentration camps, but also stresses the optimism and desire to survive of the survivors.\n\nThe film won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://us.macmillan.com/thelastdays/DavidCesarani&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://us.macmillan.com/thelastdays/DavidCesarani&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe devastation of Hungarian Jewry was among the worst atrocities of World War II, encompassing the murder of hundreds of thousands of men, women and children in the final months of the war.\n\nFacing defeat, Hitler and his allies brought the Holocaust to Hungary with unprecedented speed and barbarity. The Hungarian Jewish population was rounded up and deported to concentration camps in just 54 days. 437,402 Jews. 148 trains. Destination: Auschwitz.\n\nThe German plan for annihilation of the Jews-called the \\'Final Solution\\'-set the goal that not a single survivor would be left to bear witness to the events. Fifty years later, Steven Spielberg established Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation to record the testimony of as many survivors as possible. From the ashes of the Holocaust these voices now emerge to share their stories and to represent the nearly six million Jews who did not survive.\n\nSurvivors and liberators share what they experienced in gripping, firsthand testimony. Archival photographs document history, and powerful color images chronicle the survivors\\' emotional return to the places of their pasts:from homes unseen for fifty years to the ghettos and concentration camps of their imprisonment. Top scholars have been brought together to share their insights into one of humanity\\'s darkest chapters. These elements are poignantly synthesized in The Last Days as a warning for all mankind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a945fa96da439637ee34eafea8d123e4eca764d4","amp;dn":"The+Last+Days+%28Spielberg+1998+Holocaust+Docu+-+Hungarian+Jews%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a945fa96da439637ee34eafea8d123e4eca764d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,69,250,150,218,67,150,55,238,52,234,254,168,209,35,228,236,167,100,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
