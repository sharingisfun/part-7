Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons in 1961, the 323-page book was edited by Albert D. Biderman of the Bureau of Social Science Research and Herbert Zimmer, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Georgia, and funded by the U.S. government.\n\nThe editors' introduction reads:\n\nThis book represents a critical examination of some of the conjectures about the application of scientific knowledge to the manipulation of human behaviour. The problem is explored within a particular frame of reference: the interrogation of an unwilling subject. A number of scientific areas have figured prominently in speculations regarding the application of science to the manipulation of behaviour in interrogation (69). For this work, scientists who had done research in each of these areas were asked to review the state of relevant knowledge in their fields, to consider whether and how it might be applied by interrogators, and to evaluate the recourse available to highly motivated persons for resisting the attempted influence. Their reports constitute the body of this book.\n\nEach of the 7 chapters is a comprehensive review of the literature available at the time regarding a torture technique. Most of the literature reviewed came from government-funded studies. The chapters are:\n\n   1. The Physiological State of the Interrogation Subject as it Affects Brain Function, by Lawrence E. Hinkle, Jr.\n   2. The Effects of Reduced Environmental Stimulation on Human Behaviour: A Review, by Philip E. Kubzansky.\n   3. The Use of Drugs in Interrogation, by Louis A. Gottschalk.\n   4. Physiological Responses as a Means of Evaluating Information, by R. C. Davis.\n   5. The Potential Uses of Hypnosis in Interrogation, by Martin T. Orne.\n   6. The Experimental Investigation of Interpersonal Influence, by Robert R. Blake and Jane S. Mouton.\n   7. Counter-manipulation through Malingering, by Malcolm L. Meltzer.&quot;\n\n~~~\n\nI am always adding new things, so check this account often.\n\nVisit roguesci (dot) org (slash) theforum, and register, for the world's longest running largest explosives and weapons forum on the web!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c30e3cbb91efbff7d37a4cee4677de4b0aee2183","amp;dn":"The+Manipulation+of+Human+Behavior","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c30e3cbb91efbff7d37a4cee4677de4b0aee2183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,14,60,187,145,239,191,247,211,122,76,238,70,119,222,75,10,238,33,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
