You&amp;#039;ll notice a lot of tracks are missing from the Collectables cd. This is because they are already included on the Taragon cd and in tremendously better quality. The Collectables cd consists of Peggy&amp;#039;s debut album and the b-side of her first single. The songs are in stereo but the quality is okay, not great. The music itself is very campy teeny bopper fluff. There are no duds or filler here. All the songs have catchy tunes and beautiful orchestration. The tracks I did not include were very muddy sounding and in mono. \n\nThe Taragon cd concentrates on the singles she released from 1962-1968. This includes a few of her earlier campy songs but most of the songs are serious girl group fare with a touch of northern soul. And the last song starts to venture into psychedelia. And as an extra they included the Japanese version of I Will Follow Him, which seems rather pointless. It is the same instrumental track with Peggy&amp;#039;s Japanese vocals poorly dubbed over her English ones. Overall, the sound quality is great. The vocals are nicely centered and everything sounds crisp and new.\n\nTRACK LIST:\n\nI Will Follow Him:\n\n02. Dream World\n03. Johnny Cool\n04. Oh-Oh I&amp;#039;m Falling In Love Again\n05.
