Its contents span most of the length of his career up to the time of its release, starting in 1956 with his first hit record, &quot;Please, Please, Please&quot;, and ending with &quot;Unity&quot;, his 1984 collaboration with Afrika Bambaataa. Writing in 2007, Robert Christgau described it as &quot;the finest box set ever released... as essential a package as the biz has ever hawked, not just because it's James Brown, but because compilers Cliff White and Harry Weinger invested so much care and knowledge in it.&quot; Its title comes from the question Brown's announcer would ask concert audiences, as heard on the album Live at the Apollo: &quot;Are you ready for star time?&quot;\n\nStar Time's liner notes, written by Cliff White, Harry Weinger, Nelson George, Alan Leeds, and Brown himself, won a 1991 Grammy Award for Best Album Notes. The notes also include a discography and a one-page comic by Mary Fleener, a visual interpretation of the song &quot;I Got You (I Feel Good).&quot;\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 79 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It was the second-highest ranking box set on the list.\n\n.: Locandina :.\n\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\nDisc 1 (&quot;Mr. Dynamite&quot;)\n\n    &quot;Please Please Please&quot; (James Brown, Johnny Terry) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:43\n    &quot;Why Do You Do Me&quot;
