From that time to the line up of players it had when&quot;Spooky&quot; first hit the charts,the only original member still with them was Walter Eaton on guitar.Dennis Yost came in as the singer/drummer who would later front the group(literally) but who eventually would just concentrate on vocals after another drummer would be hired to do those honours.In 1968 their\nversion of &quot;Spooky&quot; hit the charts big time,followed by &quot;Stormy&quot;. In 1969 they would lead off with another big one,the slower but nice &quot;Traces&quot;. Also included are their more minor releases:&quot;Everyday With You Girl&quot;,&quot;Change Of Heart&quot;,&quot;Midnight&quot;and &quot;The Funniest Thing&quot;. It's all here,all their major and minor hits on Imperial,for the casual and the more intense fan. \n\nBy Robert Badgley (London,Ontario,Canada)\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Spooky                                               [02:53]\n02.Soul train                                           [02:45]\n03.Stormy                                               [02:49]\n04.Traces                                               [02:48]\n05.Everyday with you girl                               [02:34]\n06.Change of heart                                      [02:58]\n07.Midnight                                             [02:55]\n08.The funniest thing                                   [02:38]\n09.Where did all the good times go                      [02:37]\n10.Mama's and papa's                                    [02:07]\n____\n\n27:04 min\n 41,6 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
