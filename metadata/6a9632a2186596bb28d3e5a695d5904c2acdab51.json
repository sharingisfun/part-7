The car spins, and Tasha hits her head. Michael, terrified that Tasha is dead, tries to free them from the wreckage,\nbut before he can do so, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blinded by the light of an oncoming vehicle . . .\n\nHe wakes to find himself in the hospital of a small town in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. What is he doing\nthere? Who is he? He canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even remember his own name Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gregory Merrick,\naccording to the doctor.\n\nAs he convalesces, he becomes acquainted with the community and forms a relationship with a smart, pretty\nlocal girl. But as he recovers his mobility, he begins to notice odd things happening. People disappearing. Strangers being ignored by the locals, as if they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even there. Then his new girlfriend vanishes, and he begins to think the unthinkable . . . could he actually be dead? The truth, however, is far more shocking . . .\n\nepub and mobi.
