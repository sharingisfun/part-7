The colossal effort Carr has exerted to produce his latest book, â€œThe Legend of Broken,â€ weighs distressingly on each of the novelâ€™s 734 pages, including nearly 80 pages of endnotes. This is a fantasy epic â€” the tale of a fabled Germanic kingdom that rose and fell during the Dark Ages â€” but with its convoluted prose, its trudging plot and its onslaught of unsurprising period detail, itâ€™s a perverted one. Sweat drips from the pages. Magic does not rise","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ceb97e4a398b9284cd0cfef9f46b9e6e4b51952","amp;dn":"THE+LEGEND+OF+BROKEN+-+Caleb+Carr+-+Reynolds-Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ceb97e4a398b9284cd0cfef9f46b9e6e4b51952","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,235,151,228,163,152,185,40,76,208,207,239,159,70,185,230,228,181,25,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
