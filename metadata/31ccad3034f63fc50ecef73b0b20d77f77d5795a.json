He wants to sing on the biggest stages, for the biggest crowds, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do whatever it takes to make it come true. But Zack also made a promise to his college sweetheart when he left Kentucky to compete on the popular TV show Fifteen Minutes: If he made it, nothing would change him or his faith in God.\n\nOvernight, Zack becomes the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular contestant, a country singer comparable to a young Tim McGraw. As his star rises, Zack is often asked to compromise and quiet his beliefs. Just as heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the verge of winning it all, his choices lead him to the brink of personal disaster. Meanwhile, a former Fifteen Minutes winner is searching for meaning amidst her own private losses. Can she warn Zack about the real price of fame? Or will Zack lose everything he loves for his fifteen minutes of glory?\n\nFrom the novelist dubbed the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Queen of Christian FictionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Time magazine, Fifteen Minutes explores the cost of fame and celebrity set against the backdrop of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite singing competition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31ccad3034f63fc50ecef73b0b20d77f77d5795a","amp;dn":"Fifteen+Minutes+-+Karen+Kingsbury","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31ccad3034f63fc50ecef73b0b20d77f77d5795a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,204,173,48,52,246,63,197,14,206,247,59,11,32,215,127,119,213,121,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
