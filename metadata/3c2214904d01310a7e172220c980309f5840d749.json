Rich with new anecdotal material, it offers fresh evaluations and sheds new light on Europe's most controversial and enigmatic general, politician, and statesman.\nArrogant, haughty, single-minded in war, politics, and his personal life, Charles de Gaulle ranks in many ways as the most powerful personality of an epoch blessed (and cursed) with powerful men. Hitler, Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin, Truman, Kennedy, and Khrushchev: all locked horns with de Gaulle, and all eventually bowed to his wishes.\n\nThis exciting biography takes full measure of the man and full measure of his times, when great soldiers and statesmen fought center stage and the fate of the world hung in the balance. \n\nWritten by: Don Cook\nNarrated by: Frederick Davidson\nLength: 22 hrs and 49 mins\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:04-09-09\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c2214904d01310a7e172220c980309f5840d749","amp;dn":"Charles+de+Gaulle+A+Biography+by+Don+cook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c2214904d01310a7e172220c980309f5840d749","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,34,20,144,77,1,49,10,126,23,34,32,201,128,48,159,88,64,215,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
