Upon its release, the album reached number one on the charts in 6 countries including Australia, New Zealand, Netherlands and United Kingdom, while debuting at number two in Germany, Ireland, and United States. Singles from the album include &quot;So What&quot;, which is considered as Pink's most successful song to date, and is her first to ever reach the top spot in the United States. &quot;Sober&quot; and &quot;Please Don't Leave Me&quot; were released as the second and third singles respectively, and both reached the Top 20 and the 2009 Year-End Chart in the United States. They were followed by title track and &quot;I Don't Believe You&quot; which received moderate success. Final single, &quot;Glitter in the Air&quot;, which was performed at the 52nd Grammy Awards, was released as the seventh single of the album, and reached top 20 in the Billboard Hot 100. To date, Funhouse has earned Pink three Grammy nominations and five VMA nominations. It became her highest charter in the United States, peaking at #2 on the Billboard 200 and receiving a rank on the year-end chart for the years 2008 (#130), 2009 (#16) and 2010 (#64). It is also the first album by P!nk to spawn a number-one single there, in addition to five Hot 100 entries, four of which reached the top twenty. It's also her third to feature a Parental Advisory sticker and her best seller since 2001's Missundaztood, having sold over seven million units by July, 2010. Just like I'm Not Dead, Funhouse was re-released. The re-release took place one year after the original release date, it included a bonus DVD and was accompanied by the release of Funhouse Tour: Live in Australia, a live album taped during Pink's Australian leg of the Funhouse Tour.\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] So What\n[02] Sober\n[03] I Don't Believe You\n[04] One Foot Wrong\n[05] Please Don't Leave Me\n[06] Bad Influence\n[07] Funhouse\n[08] Crystal Ball\n[09] Mean\n[10] It's All Your Fault\n[11] Ave Mary A\n[12] Glitter In The Air\n[13] This Is How It Goes Down - - - P!nk Featuring Travis McCoy\n[14] Why Did I Ever Like You\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:51m:50s\n\nMusic Video\n\n[01] So What (MPG)\n\n\nTotal File Size....................... 181mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Video Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
