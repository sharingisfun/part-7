Beginning with fundamental chapters on the psychological, environmental, and social aspects of aging, the book approaches patient care from a holistic point of view. Subsequent chapters show the importance of this information in a practical context by discussing how it affects office environment, decision?-making and treatment planning, and the management and treatment of common geriatric oral conditions. Case studies and study questions are used to illustrate application of educational presentations to practice settings. Contributed by leaders in the field, Geriatric Dentistry will strengthen readersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ understanding and clinical acumen in addressing this special population.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:459dae06a2fcdb9f55b4803815c4f70378245e65","amp;dn":"Geriatric+Dentistry+%28Wiley%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"459dae06a2fcdb9f55b4803815c4f70378245e65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,157,174,6,162,252,219,159,85,180,128,56,21,196,247,3,120,36,94,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
