Even though it says it's for 4.21, it does work for Rogero 4.30.\n* toggle_qa\nOnly for 3.55 CFW. Install and run this ONLKY a console that hasn't previously had toggle_qa run on it. It helps if you want to downgrade later.\n* Condor Updater 3.1\nMakes it easier to get in to Recovery Mode.\n* DeanK's installPKG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78bc3b4c07a888810f1a99b379e923b59079fc38","amp;dn":"PS3+Rogero+CFW+kit+4.30+2.05+%2B+3.55+3.7a+%2B+downgrader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78bc3b4c07a888810f1a99b379e923b59079fc38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,188,59,76,7,168,136,129,15,26,153,179,121,233,35,181,144,121,252,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
