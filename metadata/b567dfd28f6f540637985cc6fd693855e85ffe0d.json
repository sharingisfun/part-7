Read all about the options.\n2. Don't change anything you without a reason.\n\n\n * Apply OOBE Fix\n    This applies the Out Of Box Experience -&gt;OOBE Patch\n    which removes the 'Activate Windows' link from the\n    start menu and makes the Activating Windows Dialog\n    saying 'Already Activated'\n\n    Note: This is more a cosmetically fix and really not\n          needed for the patch to work properly.\n\n\n * Apply WPA Fix\n    This removes the WPA-Check in Winlogon.exe.\n    If you want to get rid of the Windows Activation\n    this MUST be Enabled !\n    Disable this if you just want to undo the OOBE-Fix.\n\n    Note: However you can use this program also to\n          decrypt and unprotect other MS-Files\n          like DPCDLL.dll or LICDLL.DLL. So if you\n          do so disable this option.\n\n * Replace Msoobe.exe with AntiWPA\n \t Replaces the &quot;Let's Activate&quot; program with the AntiWPA.\n \t So incase you installed some servicepack which removes \n \t the patch and you are force to activate now simply click\n \t 'Yes' and instead of the activation program the patch is\n \t started...\n \t Incase you click on the &quot;Activate Windows&quot;-Link in the\n \t start menu both the patcher and the normal 'normal' \n \t activation program will be started.\n&lt;&lt;&lt; End Of 'Normal' user options !\n\n * Remove selfcheck blocks\n    Note by pressing the 'Apply' button the self checks are ALWAYS\n    disable via 'correcting' the pointer.\n\n    This option will additionally overwrite the self check block\n    calls in the program code with the value 90 (NOP=No OPeration)\n    and will improve the readability of disassembly.\n    \n    'NopOut completely' filles entired block with 0x90 Nop\n    \tIf your disassembler has the option to hide 'fillcode' like nop\n    \tthis is the best choice\n    \t\t\n    'Add short Jmp at the beginning to jump over the Nop's'\n      If you like it simple choose this\n      \n     'Fill with 'long' asmcodes with don't take that much \n     lines in the disassembling than the nop's '\n       The nop's will be relaced with the 10 Byte command\n       mov [ffffffff],ffffffff. Of course these command are not\n       executed and skipped with a short jump at the beginning.\n       \n\n    Note: This option is absolutely not necessary for the patch to work.\n\n\n * Remove crypt blocks\n    This will decrypt the crypted program parts of the input file and\n    write them back to into the exe and do some other fixes to keep the\n    File executable. If you want to disassemble the file enable this one.\n\n    Note: This option is absolutely not necessary for the patch to work.\n          Currently this option is unreliable so keep in mind that in some\n          causes it will corrupt/crash the exe. \n          (After using this my winlogon need the about 4 manually crashfixes.)\n\n\n * Debug: Save decrypted code to *.bin\n    Writes each decrypted program parts into a file with the\n    address as filename looking like this: 2C18D.bin, 3678B.bin...\n\n\n * Debug: Save decrypted code to exe\n    Writes each decrypted program parts back into the file.\n    If the option 'Remove crypt blocks' is not check just the decrypted\n    RAW-Output is written into the exe. (After you enable this you\n    have to right click on 'Apply/Browse' and open the file you want\n    to decrypt)\n\n    Note: This option is dangerous!\n          Without having 'Remove crypt blocks' option enabled this will\n          make crash the input file crash for sure.\n          This option is absolutely not necessary for the patch to work.\n\n\n * Debug: Verbose Output\n    Output Debug information\n    This may be helpful to identify some problems.\n\n\nThe Buttons\n===========\n\n[Apply/Browse]\n\nLeft click applied the selected Tasks in options.\nNote: The selfchecks of winlogon.exe are always disabled\n\t\teven if no options are selected.\n\nRight click to change the path to winlogon.\n\tGood for to apply the patch other network\n\tto some other OS or for preparing a winlogon.exe\n\tbefore creating a windows Setup CD\n\n\n[Restore]\nUndo the selected tasks in options.\n\tSo if you want to undo only the 'MSOOBE-Fix'\n\tuncheck all other options expect 'MSOOBE-Fix'\n\tand then press the restore button\n\n\n==================================================\n\tF A Q  - Frequently Asked Questions\n==================================================\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\tAfter I have installed a Service pack the Activation Reminder\n\tcounting down the days is show again.\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\nYou must reapply the patch every time after you installed a servicepack and\neverything will be fine :)\n\nNote: The Patch donÃƒÂ¦Ã…Â Ã‚Â° ÃƒÂ¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã‚Â³ctivated?Windows it only removes the check in\nwinlogon.exe\nwhich test if windows is activated or if itÃƒÂ¦Ã…Â Ã‚Â¯ still in the evaluation period\nand force you to logoff if something is wrong.\n\nWhen you install a servicepack winlogon.exe is normally overwritten by a new\nNot patched Version. So you need reapply the patch.\nUsually the servicepack reset the trial counter so it will restart at 30 days.\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\tI canÃƒÂ¦Ã…Â Ã‚Â° start patch because my evaluation period expired and\n\tNow IÃƒÂ¦Ã…Â Ã‚Â¦ unable to login.\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\nYou can still login in safe mode even if your evaluation period expired.\nPress F8 right after the Bios boot screen and select Safe Mode\n(Without Network support) menu now windows should boot in safe mode and you can\nLogin and apply the Anti-WPA-Patch.\n\nNote: Since no Network support is available in safe mode no Internet or Network\nIs available so itÃƒÂ¦Ã…Â Ã‚Â¯ good to have the patch somewhere on the hard disk or on a\nfloppy disk?\nIf you select Safe Mode (with Network support) you are unable to login due to\nActivation is necessary.\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n   Well windows says that it was activated but when i restarted my pc,\n   a pop up message appears and says that i have only 25 days to activate windows.\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????    \nThis means the patch is not active.\nOr only the oobe-fix was applied but not there was an error applying \nthe real patch -&gt; see FAQ: know problem asian system\n\nAfter you applied the patch start it again -now it should say 'Already applied'.\nIf not start it again and check is there are any errors in the log output.\nIf there are no errors, but you still don't get 'Patch already applied' disable the windows systemfile protection manually.\n\nBackground:\nEverytime you login the activation is done and the days remaining are written to\nHKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionWPAEvents[OOBETimer].\n(Note: they're only written not read from there so changing this has absolutely\n no effect on activation.) Also a special value means Activation done.(-&gt;xp-wpa-crack.txt). msoobe.exe and msinfo32.exe only use this value to determinate whether Windows is activated or not. So right after the Patch everything looks fine the Activation Dialog shows 'Already Activated'. But if you login the OOBETimer value is 'updated' -since the real check is still active- and trial countdown continues...\n\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\tI want to change my CD-Key - but msoobe.exe also says\n\t'Already Activated and don't show the Activation Dialog\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\nEnable option 'Apply OOBE Fix' and\nDisable option 'Apply &amp;WPA Fix' -to keep the WPA-Patch active-\nthen click on the 'Restore Backup' Button\n\nPREVIOUS VERSIONS:\nStart regedit and go to\nHKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionWPAEvents[OOBETimer]\nEdit this and set Last Byte to FF.\nStart this -if the Activation are delete- to show the Activation dialog:\n%SYSTEMROOT%system32oobemsoobe.exe /A\n\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\tIs it possible to integrate WPA_KILL.EXE in the WinXP setup-routine?\n\tI have a WinXP pro setup CD (sp2 integrated).\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\nIntegrating the AntiWPA Patch in the Windows Setup:\n\n1. Extract [WindowsSetupDir]i386winlogon.ex_ to a temporary Dir.\n   (Winrar or winace will do the job - or rename it to winlogon.cab and\n   double-click on it - to use the build-in WindowsCabExtract)\n\n2. Apply the WPA Crack to the file.\n   Right click on 'Apply/Browse' and choose the file.\n   (To unlock all buttons of the WPA-Patch right click on 'Quit')\n\n3. Repack winlogon.exe an put it back in the installation folder\n   Use Winace (and choose MS-Cab as compression method) and name\n   the packed cab-file winlogon.ex_.\n   Or use the makecab.exe(included in Windows XP) start cmd.exe in the dir\n   winlogon.exe is in and Enter:\n\n   makecab winlogon.exe\n\nAfter that you will get winlogon.ex_ as output.\n\nPREVIOUS VERSIONS:\nIn previous versions the PE Checksum of the file wasn't updated by the patch.\nThis caused setup to reject winlogon.exe during installation.\nBut this has been fixed in this version.\n\n\nManually OOBE_Fix for WindowsSetup\n----------------------------------\nSince I see people integrating the patched winlogon.exe into windows setup are\nperfectionist here's a hint how to may you get rid of the activationlinks in\nthe startmenu (-untested-):\nOk unpack and edit syssetup.inf\n\n1. search for\n\t[StartMenuCommon]\n\tand delete this to avoid the activate link in START\n\t%oobe_desc% = oobemsoobe.exe,&quot;%%SYSTEMROOT%%system32oobemsoobe.exe\n/A&quot;,,0,&quot;@%SystemRoot%system32oobemsoobe.exe,-2001&quot;,&quot;%SystemRoot%system32oob\nemsoobe.exe&quot;,2000\n\t(btw you can also delete this unless %windowscatalog% link section if you\nlike)\n\n2.\tIn SystemTools it's the same\n\t[SystemTools]\n\t%oobe_desc% = oobemsoobe.ex...\n\nJust for better understanding the inf-file format at the end is defined what the\nvariable &quot;oobe_desc&quot; is:\noobe_desc = &quot;Windows aktivieren&quot;\nThis was were I first stepped when I searched for &quot;Windows aktivieren&quot; in\nC:windows\nThe second was to look for oobe_desc...\n\nNo-CDKey-Patch for WindowsSetup\n-------------------------------\n- Since I got some positiv feedback about this I decided to publish this.\n  But so far I'ven't test it myself-\n\nThis will make the WindowsSetup to accept any -even a blank- CDKey\nGet &quot;http://antiwpa.tk/Other/cracked pidgen for setup.rar&quot;\nPack it pidgen.dll with cab-pack to pidgen.dl_ as decribed above\nand put it in the I386 setupdir.\nThat's it.\n\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\tWhat changes does this patch to my System and how to undo it?\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n1. It modifies c:WINDOWSsystem32Winlogon.exe and creates a\n   backup named Winlogon.bak\n   UNDO: Rename Winlogon.exe -&gt; Winlogon.OUT\n         Rename Winlogon.bak -&gt; Winlogon.exe\n         After Reboot you will be able to delete Winlogon.OUT if you like\n\n\n2. The RegistryValue\n   HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionWPAEvents[OOBETimer]\n   is set to a fixed value as it is activated.\n   UNDO: Edit this with Regedit and set Last Byte to FF.\n         This will 'DeActivate' Windows\n\n   Note: Normally this value is written (not read!) by winlogon.exe on\n         every start up just as information for MSOOBE.\n         This value has no effect on the real Activation.\n\n\n3. The 'Activate Windows' Link from the Startmenu is remove\n   UNDO: StartExecute:\n   rundll32 setupapi,InstallHinfSection RESTORE_OOBE_ACTIVATE 132 syssetup.inf\n\n\n4. 'Replace Msoobe.exe with AntiWPA' renames your original msoobe.exe\n\tto msoobe.com and copies it self to &lt;windows&gt;system32oobemsoobe.exe\n\n\nOther Changes:\nHKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionSetup\n&quot;SourcePath&quot; and &quot;ServicePackSourcePath&quot; will be temporary delete during the\npatch\nand (if nothing really bad happens) restored if it's finished.\n\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\tHow to set another path to Winlogon.exe?\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\nRight click on the 'Apply/Browse' button.\nIf the Patch is already and the 'Apply/Browse' button is greyed out\nRight click on the 'Quit' button to force unlock all buttons.\n\nNote: You can also use the Windows Anti WPA Patch to de-protect\n      (Remove SelfCheckBlock SCB) from other protected\n      Microsoft exe and dll's:\n      For ex: licdll.dll, DPCDLL.dll or Windows PLUS! Pack Executables\n      Of course the WPA-Patch is skipped in this case.\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\tThe Patch doesn't work after I rebooted, the WPA Reminder pops up again.\n\tAlso during the Patch the Windows Systemfile Protection Dialogbox didn't\n\tcome up.\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\nMaybe the Patch was undone by the Windows File Protection.\nTo check if the patch is still active start the Windows Anti WPA Patch again and\ncheck if it says 'Patch already applied'.\n\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\tHow to disable this damn Windows File Protection(WFP)?\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\nThere is no really official way to disable this\n\nThis is an undocumented setting worked for recent windows versions:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionWinlogon\nSFCDisable=0xffffff9d\n\nBUT: It was removed in Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 and in Windows XP!\nWhen you restart your computer, the System event log will contain Event ID\n64032, &quot;Windows File Protection is not active on this system.&quot;\n\nSFCDisable (REG_DWORD)\n0 = enabled (default - WinXP Professional)\n1 = disabled, prompt at boot to re-enable - Require a kernel debugger to be\nhooked up or this will be ignored!\n2 = disabled at next boot only, no prompt to re-enable - Require a kernel\ndebugger to be hooked up or this will be ignored!\n4 = enabled, with popups disabled (default - for all Server Windows)\nMore about this and how to re-enable the 'SFCDisable=0xffffff9d-setting'\n -&gt; http://www.collakesoftware.com/aboutwfp.htm\nTo make this more flexible here is a search'n'replace patch:\n(Rename sfc_os.dll to sfc_os.OUT; copy sfc_os.OUT to sfc_os.dll)\nOpen sfc_os.dll in a hex editor\nSearch for  : 83 f8 9D 75 08 33 C0 40\nReplace with: 83 f8 9D EB 08 33 C0 40\n\nSo this is where it comes from:\n         A1 D8E1C376     MOV     EAX, [SFCDisable]\nPatch- &gt; 83F8 9D         CMP     EAX, -63\t\t\t\t\t;-63 =&gt; 0xffffff9d !\nSearch &gt; 75 08           JNZ     SHORT Don't_Set_SFCDisable_=_1\nData   &gt; 33C0            XOR     EAX, EAX\n       &gt; 40              INC     EAX\n         A3 D8E1C376     MOV     [SFCDisable], EAX\n:Don't_Set_SFCDisable\n\nBtw this fragment is the reason 0xffffff9d don't work anymore - so\nNop Out (=overwrite with 0x90) that bastard\n\n-&gt; You can download a Patch that does that change from antiwpa.tk /others!\n\n\nWell I found a real simple way to disable this for sure:\nRename c:WINDOWSsystem32sfc.dll to sfc-OUT.dll to something else\nAfter Reboot the WFP is disabled.\nBUT I advice to rename sfc-OUT.dll back to sfc.dll soon because I notice\nthat you can't install any new hardware device driver because syssetup.dll\nstatically imports sfc.dll and fail to load if sfc.dll is not found.\n\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\tThe Patcher doesnÃƒÂ¦Ã…Â Ã‚Â° find any offset. / Know problem on Asian systems.\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\nWPA_KILL.EXE currently don't work with Asian Systems (Taiwan, Japan...) with\nDBCS (Double Character Set)\nenabled. \nAn error (unintented behaviour) in the string handling functions  \nof the Patch program causes problems on DBCS systems. \nBut the Patch logic/Algo also works for this systems. \n \n\n\nWorkaround:  \n\n\nWorkaround:\nIf you have such systems disable DBCS.\nOr copy your winlogon.exe to an none DBCS system apply the patch to your winlogon\nand copy the patched winlogon.exe back in your system. \n-&gt; Pay attention that the Windows System File Protection don't restore your original \nwinlogon!(see FAQ: How to disable the Windows File Protection ?)\nHave a look into system events logs or compare both file dates \nto see if WFP has restored winlogon.exe\n\n\nAs far as I found out the Test Version function does not work properly and you\nget 'unknown Version'. A Workaround that might work is to use the offset locator to detect/set the right offset manually.\n(Hint: Compare the detected offset with the known-offset-list)\nThe problem is related to some improper char handling and/or comparing inside\nFrmMain.Test() i.e FileStream::FixedString()\nEveryone how has an Asian System and MSOffice(Note: VBA is always also installed\ntogether with MSO) or Visual Basic 6 is welcome to invite me to a remote\nSession. - so I can examine and fix that problem - Please send me an email...\nAnd of course youÃƒÂ¦Ã…Â Ã‚Â®e also welcome to fix it your self:\nantiwpa.tk\nothercracknfoproblem-onasian-systems.rar\nSRCantiwpa-2.0.0-winxp-2k3-src.zip\n\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\tHow you access/modify the winlogon.exe file while it is running ?\n\tI only saw you are using standart API calls but I must have missed\n\tsomething...\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n\nHow to modify a file (like winlogon.exe) while it is in use:\n\n1.Rename winlogon.exe -&gt; winlogon.bak\n  That's the most important thing about that. You can't delete or\n  modify a file that's in use, but you can RENAME it! (under Win9x\n  this don't work. Rename the dir containing the file instead...)\n\n2.Copy winlogon.bak -&gt; winlogon.exe\n\n3.Now you can edit winlogon.exe. Of course you can't delete (or\n  modify) winlogon.bak as long as it is in use.\n  But you surely want to keep an backup of it, don't you?\n\nOh I almost forgot to mention an other annoy thing:\n&gt;The Windows system File Protection (WFP) &lt;\nWhen renaming/modifying winlogon.exe as described above the WFP will immediately\nrestore the original file without any warning(There will just be an entry in the\nevent logger - but how cares about this).\nTo avoid this:\n* Delete all files in C:windowssystem32dllcache*.*\n* Rename the path were installed your last Service pack or the path to\nthe windows installation file to something else like\n'D:installsWinXP_SP2' -&gt; 'D:installsWinXP_SP2.out'\nSo the WFP won't file them to restore\n\nWell the WPA-Patch doesn't rename your Windows installation path it deletes\ntemporary the path to this in you registry and restores it after the patch\n(actually after you clicked on the OK button of the messagebox).\nThese Registry paths are:\nHKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionSetup\n&quot;SourcePath&quot;= &quot;D:installsWinXP_CD&quot;\n&quot;ServicePackSourcePath&quot; =&quot;D:installsWinXP_SP2&quot;\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nJust a hint to see if the patch worked without to Reboot:\n\n1.Apply the patch\n2.Logon as an other user\n(But don't log of - choose change/disconnect user)\n3.When you login just see if the patch works...\n... or if not this damn\n'You haven't activated your Windows yet...' message\n\n(4.If you logoff the first user now 'winlogon.bak' is no long in use\nand you can delete/modify it)\n\nAh and to get a better overview about the processes which are running on your\nmachine use this: http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/procexp.shtml\nAnd next time you can't delete a files use 'search handle' and enter the\nfilename then close the handle(=file) or kill the process...\n\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\tDoes the AntiWPA Crack make winlogon.exe unstable?\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n\nSince the WPA 1.6.2 disables all anti crack self checks in winlogon.exe it may\nexecute some msec faster :)\nThe patch simply makes winlogon.exe to skip the function which will do the\nWPA-Check( update of WPA trial counter) and block any login if the result is 'negative'.\n\nFrom 'outside' this windows is simple not activated but as long your using a\nvalid CDKEY Windows update will work and is not affected by the WPA-Patch\n&gt; does the patch make winlogon.exe unstable?\nNo. If it is applied correctly winlogon.exe will not become unstable/crash.\n(The only time winlogon.exe becomes unstable is after appling wpa-kill 1.1 to\nWinXP SP1 - but this bug was fix in version 1.2...)\nOf course with the wrong offset in offset locator you can make winlogon.exe\nunstable/crash or by killing the patcher during the patch is applied.\n\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\nPREVIOUS VERSIONS:\n\tI got 'ERROR: Unknown Version of winlogon.exe'.\n\tCan you include this version in your WPA-Patcher ?\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\nWell please try the offset locator button to patch this new Version. Since\nVersion 1.4 I added a heuristic search for offset locator which should find the\nright offset by default and highlight it.\nSo -after you read the warning- just double click on the highlight Offset on the\nList to set this as new patch-Offset.\n\nIf this is not a Beta or Release Candidate Version send me your -unpatched-\nWinlogon.exe by email and add if the default offset (found by the for offset\nlocator) works.\n\n\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\nPREVIOUS VERSIONS:\n\tThe patch don't work - if i click on the 'Activate Windows' link in the\n\tstart menu, it says Windows isn't activated and that there are only xx days\nleft.\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\nThis patch didn't stop the trial counter nor will it 'Activate' your Windows.\n\nThe WPA-Patch fixes the condition jump which decides whether windows was started\nin safe mode\nand the activation check should be skipped or if it was started in normal mode\nand it should be done.\nSo in short it will make winlogon.exe to skip the is-Windows-activated check\nwhen you logon.\n\nTo see if the patch work wait about one minute after you logon -\nif the Activation reminder balloon in the tray bar DON'T pop up - the patch IS\nworking.\nSome other things to see that it works\nThe messagebox that reminders you to active if there are only 5 days left and\nThe messagebox that says you're not allowed to logon until you active will be\naway.\n\nSo patching msobmain.dll just to make it say it's activated is only additional\noverheat and\nalso may cause some problems. Maybe if you want to change your CDKey and you\ndon't reach the CDKEY change dialog because it says already activated...\nOk what I need to do is to include some FAQ-info text in the next version about\nthat issue.\nMaybe I will add a &quot;Let's Activate Windows&quot; force true patch if there is such a\nbig need for this\nI mean if this will make someone sleeps better at night - is enough for a good\nreason.\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nHistory\n2.1.5 jul'05\n\tBugfix: When PE-Checksum was updated PE-Header was incorrectly written to file\n\t\n2.1.4 jun'05\n\tAdd 64-bit detection to PE-File open function\n\n2.1.3 May'05\n\tMinorbugfix: warningmessage when enable menu 'Debug: save to exe' now appears at the right time\n\n2.1.2 May'05\n\tBugfix for 'Remove crypt blocks' (Tail stub is not overwritten anymore)\n\tURL-Updated to http:\\Antiwpa3.tk\n\n2.1.0 Mar'05\n\t'Replace Msoobe.exe with AntiWPA' option added\n\tOptionsdialog for 'Remove selfcheck blocks' added\n\n2.0.2 Feb'05\n\tUpdates in readme\n\n2.0.1 Nov'04\n\t'Remove crypt Blocks' option didn't calculate correct\n\tfixup address for WinLH winlogon.exe fixed\n\tUpdates in readme\n\n2.0.0 Oct'04\n  Patcher is now able to scan the crypt code parts\n  and to finds the right patch offset automatically\n  (no Version and offset locator hassle anymore)\n  PE Checksum of patched file is updated\n  Added Restore Backup Function\n  Added menu bar with Options\n\n1.7.x  Oct'04\n  *Internal Beta Versions*\n\n1.6.2 Sep'04\n  Added MSOOBE Activation Fix\n  Added Readme.txt\n\n1.6 Aug'04\n  Added support for WinXP SP2 2180\n\n1.5 Jul'04\n  BugFix: Changes set by offsetlocator were not written to disk\n\n1.4 Jun'04\n  Added support for WinXP SP2 RC1 2142\n  Added heuristic search for offset locator\n\n1.3 Jun'04\n  Added support for WinXP SP2 RC1 2120\n  smaller changes\n\n1.2 Apr'04\n  Patch recoded in Visual Basic 6\n  Added generic check block disabler\n  Added offset locator to support unknown versions\n  Added support for WinXP SP2 Beta and Win2K3\n  Improved Windows File Protection support\n\n1.1 Nov'03\n  BugFix: SP1 crashed when returning from standby\n  Improved Windows File Protection support\n\n1.0 Sep'03\n  First release using the apatch-engine\n\n\n&lt;http:\\Antiwpa3.tk&gt;\t\t\t\t&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;12716073717965736077207952746077777c77663c7677&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b567dfd28f6f540637985cc6fd693855e85ffe0d","amp;dn":"Windows+2003+%26+XP+%26+LH+Anti+Product+Activation+Crack+v2.1.5.0.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b567dfd28f6f540637985cc6fd693855e85ffe0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,103,223,210,143,111,84,6,55,152,92,198,253,105,56,85,232,95,254,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
