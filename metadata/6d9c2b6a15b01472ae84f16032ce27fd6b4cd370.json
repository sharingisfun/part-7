O'Bannon. It originally aired on NBC between 1993 and 1996.\n\nSet in &quot;the near future&quot;, seaQuest originally mixed high drama with realistic scientific fiction. It starred Roy Scheider as Nathan Bridger, captain of the eponymous high-tech submarine seaQuest DSV 4600, Jonathan Brandis as Lucas Wolenczak, a teenaged computer genius, and Stephanie Beacham as Kristin Westphalen, the chief medical officer and head of the seaQuest science department. Steven Spielberg expressed interest in the project and served as one of the show's executive producers during the first two seasons.\n\nThe 21st century: mankind has colonized the last unexplored region on Earth; the ocean. As captain of the seaQuest and its crew, we are its guardians. For beneath the surface lies the future.\n\n\nSource......: SeaQuest DSV Season 01 PAL DVD\nDuration....: 1 x 97 minutes + 22 x ~44 minutes (17:25:02 total runtime)\nSize........: 1 x 1.2 GB + 22 x 650 MB, 15.1 GB total\nVideo Type..: PAL DEFT conversion from NTSC; de-interlaced with TempGaussMC\nVideo Encode: MPEG-4 AVC L4.0 (no vbv) 688x564 SAR 12:11 25 fps 3-pass 1,883 kbps VBR encoded by x264 67.1130\nPlayback Res: 751x564 4:3\nAudio.......: English AC3 2.0ch 192 kbps CBR 48.0 KHz\nCommentary..: No\nSubtitles...: No\nChapters....: Yes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d9c2b6a15b01472ae84f16032ce27fd6b4cd370","amp;dn":"seaQuest+DSV+S01+PAL+DVD+DD2.0+x264+JCH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d9c2b6a15b01472ae84f16032ce27fd6b4cd370","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,156,43,106,21,176,20,114,174,132,241,96,50,206,39,253,107,76,211,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
