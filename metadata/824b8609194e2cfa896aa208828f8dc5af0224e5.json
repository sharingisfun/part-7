The director discovered hidden visual dynamite in the bottomless text of the dark genius of Dostoevsky. The best actors of the world's oldest acting school perform like there is no tomorrow. Together, they crash on your senses with an impact of a natural disasters rather then a human-made entertainment.\n\nEvery episode goes at amazing pace, rich in events, and crafted brilliantly. It never fails to captivate. Every scene has action, intensity, emotion and impact. TV drama format suits it perfectly - viewers need these breaks.\n\nAlthough the language is a problem for general English-speaking public, the film is strongly recommended to industry professionals and academics. It has material for 10 years of research and following.\n\n21 out of 21 people found the following comment useful :-\nBest 10 Hours Since Decalogue, 11 June 2005\n10/10\nAuthor: Steve from United States\n\nA fantastic achievement! Brilliant acting, especially Mironov and Inna Churikov. Olga Budina (Aglaya), Vladimir Ilyin (Lebedev), Aleksei Petrenko (General Ivolgin), and Vladimir Mashkov (Rogozhin) also give very strong performances. The masterful treatment of even the most minor characters (e.g. Yepanchin's butler) provides an incredibly rich texture for this amazing story. The main difficulty for the non-Russian speaker is the incredibly uneven quality of the English subtitles. As others have stated, the subtitles go from very good to suddenly unintelligible. In parts they annoying lag behind the dialog. The music is weak also, much of it computer-synthesized, and very repetitive. But those quibbles aside, this is a real masterpiece. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:824b8609194e2cfa896aa208828f8dc5af0224e5","amp;dn":"Idiot+2003+mini-series+in+Russian+with+english+subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"824b8609194e2cfa896aa208828f8dc5af0224e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,75,134,9,25,78,44,250,137,106,162,8,130,143,141,197,175,2,36,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
