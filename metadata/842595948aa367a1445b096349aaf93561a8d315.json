The hard-won Soviet victory prevented Hitler from waging the Second World War for another ten years and set the Germans on the road to defeat. The Soviet victory also prevented the Nazis from completing the Final Solution, the wholesale destruction of European Jewry, which began with HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;War of Annihilation&quot; against the Soviets on the Eastern Front.\nGeoffrey Roberts places the conflict in the context of the clash between two mighty powers:their world views and their leaders. He presents a great human drama, highlighting the contribution made by political and military leaders on both sides. He shows that the real story of the battle was the SovietsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ failure to achieve their greatest ambition: to deliver an immediate, war-winning knockout blow to the Germans.\n\nThis provocative reassessment presents new evidence and challenges the myths and legends that surround both the battle and the key personalities who led and planned it.\n\nReview\n`This is vintage history at its best.
