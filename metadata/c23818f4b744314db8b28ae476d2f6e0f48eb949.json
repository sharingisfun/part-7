Microsoft dropped\nmainstream support for XP in April 2009, and Vista in April 2012.\nBeyond version 11.1, Femap is 64-bit only and does not install on\nWindows XP.\n \n \nFemap Version 11.2 \n \nAnalysis Studies \nAnalysis Studies can be used to help organize output into more orderly\nand understandable data sets. You can group output sets from different\nanalysis types into separate analysis studies and operate on them\ncollectively. You can also envelope analysis studies to collect output\nmaxima and minima across collections of output sets. \n \nFree Body Section Cut \nIn Femap 11.2, you can gain a faster understanding of load paths\nthrough the model with a free body section cut, which you can\ninteractively move through the model along a predetermined path. The\nsection cut is defined using a cutting plane where the free body\nsummation is calculated and displayed for all the contributing nodes\nand elements. \n \nGeometry Modification \nFemap 11.2 introduces new geometry modification tools that allow you to\nedit geometry entities interactively, including closing modeling gaps\nthat typically occur following a mid-plane extraction command. You can\ninteractively correct or repair problematic or incorrectly defined\ngeometry as well. The Geometry Solid Slice commands available in\nprevious versions of Femap have been consolidated to provide simpler\nexecution and expanded functionality, and you can now slice solids\nusing surface or curve geometry as cutting tools. \n\n\niNSTALLATiON NOTES\n==================\n\n1. extract with 7-Zip\n2. burn / mount\n3. install\n4. use the LicenseMaker","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c23818f4b744314db8b28ae476d2f6e0f48eb949","amp;dn":"Siemens.Femap.v11.2.with.NX.Nastran.x64.ISO-TBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c23818f4b744314db8b28ae476d2f6e0f48eb949","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,56,24,244,183,68,49,77,184,178,138,228,118,210,246,224,244,142,185,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
