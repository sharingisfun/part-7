But they are also shrouded in mystery, and in this careful reading from one of our most trusted fellow travelers, C.S. Lewis helps us begin to reveal their meaning in our daily lives and in the world. Reflecting again and anew on these beloved passages, we can find both joy and difficulty, but also, always, real enlightenment and moments of transcendent grace.\n\n&quot;This book may not tell the reader all he would like to know about the Psalms, but it will tell him a good deal he will not like to know about himself.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Times Literary Supplement\n\n&quot;[Lewis] . . . displays in this volume the same keen insight and gifted tongue that have made him one of the most highly respected essayists using the English language.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Chicago Sunday Tribune\n\n&quot;Full of illuminating observations.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€New York Times\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nC.
