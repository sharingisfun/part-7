What dub?&quot;, you ask?\n   I created this word, I'm allowed to use it how I want. ;)\n  \n  Growlanser 4 has been a favorite of mine for many years; it\n  was always sad that western fans didn't know what they were\n  missing.  But now this great game finally has a chance to\n  shine in English ...\n  \n  ... and they castrated it by completely removing all of the\n      excellent voice work, leaving it a lame mute husk.\n  \n      Seriously, fuck you ATLUS.\n  \n  Fixing their hatchet job was fairly involved.  I ended up\n  writing special code analysis tools to help identify what\n  they took out so I could patch voice support back in.\n  \n  That was painful enough, but the English scripts also have\n  voice commands stripped.  Parsing the ugly script format to\n  import all the references was not much fun.\n  \n  It was tricky matching up the English and Japanese dialog\n  structure automatically, but I think it's done pretty well.\n  I only tweaked about a hundred of them manually.\n  \n  Note that the original Japanese game is very inconsistent\n  about where it has voices.  Any unvoiced lines are probably\n  not my fault.\n  \n  Overall, this was a complicated series of risky changes so\n  be glad that I am both awesome and love this game.\n  (... and hopefully I didn't break anything)\n  \n  As a bonus, I also patched back in the logic to alternate\n  between two opening\n  \n  There are a handful of short cutscenes with dialog and no\n  subtitles.  Live with it; the video quality is bad enough\n  without nasty re-encoding. \n  \n  tl;dr, Event, battle, movie and familiar chatter voices are\n         completely restored!  Enjoy.\n  \n  Tested on a PSP Slim TA-85v2 with CFW 5.50 GEN-D3.  ISO is\n  patched with Prometheus SRW_Z.  Use the included patch to\n  revert to vanilla if desired.\n  \n  Hackers/coders want to contact me?  Look for a fluffy kitty.\n  \n                     -- Update 1.01 --\n   \n  Well that was fast.   I noticed that if you use the config\n  menu all voices would end up turned off permanently.  This\n  patch fixes the issue even if you have previously done so.\n  \n                   *** USA PUBLISHERS ***\n  \n  Do it right or die in a fire, assholes.  We're sick of you\n  ruining great games.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f81b3b73d5228ee6d325b2921026cb8f3585ac1","amp;dn":"Growlanser+4%3A+Wayfarer+of+Time+USA+UNDUB+1.01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f81b3b73d5228ee6d325b2921026cb8f3585ac1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,129,179,183,61,82,40,238,109,50,91,41,33,2,108,184,243,88,90,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
