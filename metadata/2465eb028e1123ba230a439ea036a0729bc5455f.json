As a trumpet virtuoso, his playing, beginning with the 1920s studio recordings made with his Hot Five and Hot Seven ensembles, charted a future for jazz in highly imaginative, emotionally charged improvisation. For this, he is revered by jazz fans. But Armstrong also became an enduring figure in popular music, due to his distinctively phrased bass singing and engaging personality, which were on display in a series of vocal recordings and film roles.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\t19298-1/2\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.91% CDDA &amp; 99.26% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.
