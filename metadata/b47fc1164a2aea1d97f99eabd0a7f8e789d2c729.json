Numbed by the pain, she seeks a reason to live. Although a woman of the highest integrity, she has become hard and uncompromising. Far away in Italy, Matteo (Luca Barbareschi) is a ruthless, high-powered player for Hong Kong-based Feng Multinational, an international conglomerate with many interests around the world ... not all of which are above board. Lured by the highly lucrative, international trafficking of adulterated foods, the suave and cynical Matteo has abandoned all scruples and conscience and is well on his way up the underworld corporate ladder. Following a series of cold-blooded successes, he is poised to become CEO of the Feng group when fate abruptly intervenes. Crossing paths with Xiwen, the two instantly share a powerfully undeniable attraction. Tentatively, they begin to see one another, each experiencing feelings they no longer thought possible. Simultaneously, a jealous co-worker tired of living in Matteo's shadow has set into motion a plan to frame him for a triple murder. Still unaware of Matteo's involvement in the very black market trade that killed her son, Xiwen - convinced that he is innocent - compromises her own high standards, lying to police to provide him with an alibi. As Matteo attempts to unravel the mystery surrounding the murders and prove his innocence, his relationship with Xiwen continues to deepen and the emotionally damaged lovers fall deeply in love, providing each other with long-abandoned hope for happiness and a new start. But when the truth is revealed - and amidst the chaos swirling around them - Xiwen must now decide to forsake their love ... or to choose a new path together. Inspired by world affairs and headlines on the real-life trafficking of adulterated foods.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53164edde142e.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53164edde142e.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53164ede011c7.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53164ede011c7.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53164ede1460e.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53164ede1460e.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b47fc1164a2aea1d97f99eabd0a7f8e789d2c729","amp;dn":"Something+Good+The+Mercury+Factor+%282013%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b47fc1164a2aea1d97f99eabd0a7f8e789d2c729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,127,193,22,74,42,234,29,151,249,158,171,208,167,248,231,137,210,199,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
