Spanning the years 1958 to 1975, many of the songs featured here are the fiery full length versions as opposed to the single edits found on most compilations. Includes instant party classics like &quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot;, &quot;Papa's Got A Brand New Bag&quot;, &quot;Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine&quot; and &quot;The Payback&quot; as well as songs that helped shape future generations of rock &amp; soul artists such as &quot;Please Please Please&quot;, &quot;It's A Man's Man's Man's World&quot; and &quot;Night Train&quot;. The track &quot;Funky Drummer&quot;, although not a huge hit at the time, was the song sampled by the Stone Roses for their early '90s hit &quot;Fools Gold&quot;, which kickstarted a whole new movement in the UK known as &quot;Madchester&quot;.
