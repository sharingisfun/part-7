Cool Pool has all your favorites: Eight Ball, Cutthroat, Nine Ball, and more. But Cool Pool doesn't stop there. Add five wacky new pool games that could only exist on a computer, like Rocket Ball, Chameleon Ball, and 24 Cents, and you've got more fun than you can shake a cue stick at.\n\n&lt;strong&gt;Install Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt; Run the self extractor and play. Nothing else.
