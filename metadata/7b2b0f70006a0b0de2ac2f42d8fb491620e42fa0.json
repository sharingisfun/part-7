Recorded during the band's American Tour 1981 in the latter portion of that year, it was released in time for their European Tour 1982 continuation the following summer.\n\nThe album cover is a painting by Japanese artist Kazuhide Yamazaki, whose work inspired the tour's stage design.\n\nThe album was preceded by their cover of The Miracles' &quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot;, which became a Top 30 hit in the United Kingdom and United States, while follow-up single, &quot;Time Is on My Side&quot; managed to reach the lower part of the UK charts.\n\n&quot;Still Life&quot; (American Concert 1981) was a commercial success, reaching #4 in the UK and #5 in the US, going platinum there, but was not critically well-received, being admonished for sounding too slick and lacking any rough edges expected in a Rolling Stones performance. Former Stones bassist Bill Wyman may agree; the album received only a brief and dismissive mention in the otherwise heavily detailed chronicle of his life with the band, Rolling with the Stones. Of particular chagrin to Stones fans was the fact that nearly half of the Hampton Coliseum rendition of &quot;Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)&quot; was edited out for the release. (An unedited version was subsequently made available on the album Hampton Coliseum\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b2b0f70006a0b0de2ac2f42d8fb491620e42fa0","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+-+Still+Life+%28American+Concert+1981%29%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b2b0f70006a0b0de2ac2f42d8fb491620e42fa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,43,15,112,0,106,11,13,226,172,47,66,216,251,73,22,32,228,47,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
