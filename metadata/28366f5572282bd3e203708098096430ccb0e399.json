Some of these cults were violent and deadly to their followers or to others. The PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Temple, for example, ordered 918 of its followers to commit suicide in Jonestown; the number included 276 children. \n\nThe Branch Davidians sect had a confrontation with the FBI that resulted in the death of 85 of its members including its leader, David Koresh, along with 28 children. The Charles Manson (Manson Family) cult committed a series of gruesome murders and torture of its victims.\n\nHere, we have 29 titles:\n\n-  Ankerberg &amp; Weldon - Satanism and Witchcraft; the Occult and the East &amp; West (2009)\n\n-  Aquino - The Church of Satan, 6e (2009)\n\n-  Barrington - Anti-Christian Cults; an Attempt to Show That Spiritualism, Theosophy and Christian Science Are Devoid..
