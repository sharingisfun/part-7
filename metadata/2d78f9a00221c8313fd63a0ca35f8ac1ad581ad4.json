The album contains fifteen Top 20 hits from the UK and German charts, but also omits hits such as &quot;Hey Mr. Heartache&quot; (Top 15 Germany) and &quot;It's Here&quot; (Top 15 in Sweden, Norway, Switzerland). Wilde recorded two new songs for the album, including &quot;In My Life&quot; and another hit, dancefloor-influenced single &quot;If I Can't Have You&quot; (a cover of the Yvonne Elliman song) which became her last UK Top 20 hit and in Australia it was one of the biggest hits in her career. The album was certified Gold in the UK (where it reached #11 in the UK Albums Chart), Germany and Australia. It was also released in the United States (the first since Close) and has, according to SoundScan, sold 36,000 copies there.\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Kids In America\n[02] Chequered Love\n[03] Water On Glass\n[04] Cambodia\n[05] View From A Bridge\n[06] Child Come Away\n[07] Love Blonde\n[08] The Second Time\n[09] Rage To Love\n[10] You Keep Me Hangin' On\n[11] Another Step (Closer To You)\n[12] You Came\n[13] Never Trust A Stranger\n[14] Four Letter Word\n[15] Love Is Holy\n[16] If I Can't Have You\n[17] In My Life\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:04m:14s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 442mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
