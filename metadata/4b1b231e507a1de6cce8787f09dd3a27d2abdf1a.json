Eisenstein in 1932. Eisenstein's vision was to end up with a movie about Mexico in six parts called &quot;Calavera&quot;, &quot;Sandunga&quot;, &quot;Maguey&quot;, &quot;Fiesta&quot;, &quot;Soldadera&quot;, and &quot;Epilogue&quot;. The project was cancelled before it was completed due to cost overruns and months-delayed completion, and the producers refused to let Eisenstein attempt to edit anything from the material he had finished after Stalin called him back to the USSR. The 200,000-plus feet of footage was later Edited by Grigori Aleksandrov and Esfir Tobak in 1979. They also added a narrator voice in Spanish.\n\nEnglish subtitles in *.srt file.\n\nAlso Known As:\n&amp;iexcl;Que viva Mexico! (USA)\nDa zdravstvuyet Meksika!
