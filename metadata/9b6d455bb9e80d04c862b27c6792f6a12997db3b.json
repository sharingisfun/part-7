Only five years ago I was asking photographers about digital pho-tography and finding many stalwarts who Ã¢â‚¬Å“would never go digital.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ These days, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s getting harder and harder to find anyone who is shooting film. \n\nThose who do remain tend to be hybrid shooters who use both film and digital, claiming the right tool for the right job\n\nAbout This Book\n\nThis book contains information from top professional photographers who have been in the business for many years and have found solutions that work for them. Through these interviews, I found that album design ac-tually begins with marketing and is shaped by such things as the interview with the bride and groom, the proof-presentation method, the album company, and more. In fact, as you read this book, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see that every part of your business helps to shape your album design.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction, Photography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b6d455bb9e80d04c862b27c6792f6a12997db3b","amp;dn":"Photographer%27s+Guide+to+Wedding+Album+by+Bob+Coates","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b6d455bb9e80d04c862b27c6792f6a12997db3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,109,69,91,185,232,13,4,200,98,178,124,103,146,246,161,41,151,219,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
