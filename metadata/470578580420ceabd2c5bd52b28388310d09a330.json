After releasing her fourth studio album Red (2012) and embarking on The Red Tour (2013Ã¢â‚¬â€œ14), her personal life generated significant media attention. Swift began planning her follow-up project in 2013 and continued work into 2014, during which she collaborated with producers including Max Martin and Shellback, while the former served as the album's executive producer along with Swift. The album's title was inspired by the pop music scene of her birth year.\n\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Apple audio with iTunes info\nCodec ID                                 : M4A \nFile size                                : 45.9 MiB\nDuration                                 : 3mn 39s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 756 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : 1989\nAlbum/Performer                          : Taylor Swift\nTrack name                               : Shake It Off\nTrack name/Position                      : 6\nTrack name/Total                         : 13\nPerformer                                : Taylor Swift\nComposer                                 : Taylor Swift, Max Martin, Shellback\nGenre                                    : Pop\nRecorded date                            : 2014\nCover                                    : Yes\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : ALAC\nCodec ID                                 : alac\nCodec ID/Info                            : Apple Lossless Audio Codec\nDuration                                 : 3mn 39s\nDuration_LastFrame                       : -80ms\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 1 748 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits\nStream size                              : 45.7 MiB (100%)\nLanguage                                 : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:470578580420ceabd2c5bd52b28388310d09a330","amp;dn":"1989.Taylor.Swift.Apple.Lossless.ALAC.24-Bit.iSAAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"470578580420ceabd2c5bd52b28388310d09a330","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,5,120,88,4,32,206,171,210,197,189,82,178,131,136,49,13,9,163,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
