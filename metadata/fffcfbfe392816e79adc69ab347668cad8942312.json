Gregg Allman also started to confront his substance abuse problems in the past on songs such as &quot;All Night Train&quot;. This sold considerably better than its predecessor, Shades of Two Worlds. In 1998, the album went Gold. Nevertheless, critical reception was weaker. This was also the last studio album the group recorded with original second guitarist Dickey Betts.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n   01. &quot;All Night Train&quot; (Gregg Allman, Warren Haynes, Chuck Leavell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n   02. &quot;Sailin' 'Cross the Devil's Sea&quot; (Allman, Haynes, Pearson, Woody) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:57\n   03. &quot;Back Where It All Begins&quot; (Dickey Betts) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:12\n   04. &quot;Soulshine&quot; (Haynes) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:44\n   05. &quot;No One to Run With&quot; (Betts, John Prestia) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:59\n   06. &quot;Change My Way of Living&quot; (Betts) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:15\n   07. &quot;Mean Woman Blues&quot; (Betts) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:01\n   08. &quot;Everybody's Got a Mountain to Climb&quot; (Betts) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n   09. &quot;What's Done Is Done&quot; (Allman, Woody) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n   10. &quot;Temptation Is a Gun&quot; (Allman, John Friga, Neal Schon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:37\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Gregg Allman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ organ, lead vocals\n    * Dickey Betts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead guitar\n    * Warren Haynes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead guitar\n    * Allen Woody ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar\n    * Jaimoe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion\n    * Butch Trucks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fffcfbfe392816e79adc69ab347668cad8942312","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+Where+It+All+Begins+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fffcfbfe392816e79adc69ab347668cad8942312","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,252,251,254,57,40,22,231,154,220,105,171,52,118,104,202,216,148,35,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
