Diddy, and Jerry Seinfeld to more than 20 of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most reclusive billionaires, Chef Neal Salisbury has been serving the world's power elite for more than 15 years. His new book, The Billionaire's Chef: Cooking for the Rich and Famished takes you on a journey around the globe and into the private world of working for, living, and travelling with the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s billionaires.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find stories and tips on event planning and social etiquette, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not all. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get career advice from someone who has been to the top of the game, made mistakes, and groveled his way back into the game. The book goes beyond polite smile-inspiring stories and gets into the real-life challenges lived by Chef Neal and his peers, detailing disappointments and unexpected triumphs, battles of ego, the money, the sex (or sometimes lack of it) coupled with the lonelinessÃ¢â‚¬â€all a part of the job.\n\nWritten with passion, love, and respect for craft and artistry, this book focuses on what is unique about the operation of a superyacht, plane, or makeshift kitchen on a beach. Chef Neal offers an honest, yet surreal view of what it is like to have worked as a top private chef during the &quot;Golden Age&quot; (1998-2008) of superyacht building / cruising and grand estate renovation / building. Whether you read it for escapism, as a practical career reference, or to help you throw better events doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really matterÃ¢â‚¬â€just enjoy the trip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc36af9f093fd790761c29508115ce922bb2974c","amp;dn":"The+Billionaires+Chef+Cooking+for+the+Rich+and+Famished+%5BMyeBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc36af9f093fd790761c29508115ce922bb2974c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,54,175,159,9,63,215,144,118,28,41,80,129,21,206,146,43,178,151,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
