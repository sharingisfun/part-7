Romain (Melvil Poupard) is a 31-year-old gay fashion photographer and not the most likeable man in all Paris; he snaps at his assistants, mistreats his family, snorts copious amounts of coke and is generally quite far up himself. Too bad, then, the more cold-hearted viewer might snort, when he collapses at a fashion shoot and is diagnosed with an advanced form of cancer thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s barely worth treating and given just a few months to liveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nHow to deal with this news? How (indeed if) to tell family and friends? How to consider oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s suddenly shortened life? Such questions are at the heart of OzonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s film, but his treatment of them is elliptical, essential and defiantly in the first-person rather than fully realist or weepingly theatrical in the way that a less contemplative, more tear-jerking effort might attempt. Sure, RomainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attitude to his family softens (thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a quite special interlude when he spends a night with his grandmother, tenderly played by Jeanne Moreau and the only relation who knows of his illness), but our perspective of RomainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death, like his life, remains resolutely selfish. There are some awkward notes. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s difficult to swallow RomainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s late act of charity and sexual exploration: he agrees to impregnate a complete stranger (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi). And nostalgic visions of Romain as a child only just teeter on the right side of cloying. But Ozon succeeds best in presenting deathÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approach as a sort of half-removed, ghostly existence ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a point most movingly made by a beautifully conceived and choreographed final scene.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79802c3e4fbe269fce52211e46d09743accbf8c1","amp;dn":"French+Film+Collection%28Film+37%29+TIME+TO+LEAVE+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79802c3e4fbe269fce52211e46d09743accbf8c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,128,44,62,79,190,38,159,206,82,33,30,70,208,151,67,172,203,248,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
