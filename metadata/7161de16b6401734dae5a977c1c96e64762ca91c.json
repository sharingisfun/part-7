This thorughly unpleasant woman comes to look positively sympathetic by contrast with the raving fanatics she has to deal with. The jail scenes sorta remind me of the Ashley Smith case.\n\nThis movie is not for everyone, but it raher reminds me of The Panic in Needle Park - it should appeal to people who enjoyed that.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7161de16b6401734dae5a977c1c96e64762ca91c","amp;dn":"Citizen+Ruth+%281996%29+Burt+Reynolds+Tippi+Hedren+Laura+Dern","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7161de16b6401734dae5a977c1c96e64762ca91c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,97,222,22,182,64,23,52,218,229,169,119,193,201,110,100,118,44,169,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
