The band originated in Abbotsford, British Columbia. They were named after the town of Hedley, British Columbia, a name chosen after members heard that it was for sale for $346,000. While the idea of buying the town ran its course, the name remained. There are also rumors that the name &quot;Hedley&quot; originated from Hedley Street in Abbotsford, the hometown of Jacob Hoggard.\nHedley is known for its singles &quot;Never Too Late,&quot; &quot;Cha-Ching&quot; (performed at the closing ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver), &quot;Invincible,&quot; and &quot;Kiss You Inside Out,&quot; and for the band members' philanthropic work as ambassadors for the charity Free The Children.
