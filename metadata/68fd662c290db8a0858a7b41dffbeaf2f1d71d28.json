The course covers the use of parametric and graphic EQsÃ¢â‚¬â€and filters such as the high/low pass filters and shelf filtersÃ¢â‚¬â€in a variety of musical settings. These principles can be applied to any digital audio workstation platform, including Logic and Pro Tools, as well as analog workflows. Exercise files are included with the course.\n\nTopics include:\nMeasuring frequency and amplitude\nUnderstanding the relationship between frequency and pitch\nWorking with EQ controls such as bandwidth (Q) and gain\nUsing graphic EQ\nUnderstanding the shelving and high-pass and low-pass filters\nCreating focus with EQ\nCreating complementary EQ curves\nPerforming frequency bracketing with filters\nAutomating EQ\nUsing frequency analyzers\nUsing harmonic generators to excite frequency content\n\n\n\n============================&gt; PLEASE SEED &lt;==========================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68fd662c290db8a0858a7b41dffbeaf2f1d71d28","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Foundations+of+Audio%3A+EQ+and+Filters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68fd662c290db8a0858a7b41dffbeaf2f1d71d28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,253,102,44,41,13,184,160,133,138,123,65,223,251,234,242,241,215,29,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
