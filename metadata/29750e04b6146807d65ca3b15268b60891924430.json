He takes aim and appears to randomly kill five people around the stadium and on the riverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s North Shore Trail before fleeing in the van.\n\nThe police soon arrive, headed by Detective Emerson, and they discover a shell casing as well as the coin used to pay for parking. A fingerprint taken from the coin points to James Barr, a former U.S. Army sniper. When the police raid his house, they find the van, equipment for making bullets, the rifle in question, and Barr, whom they arrest.\n\nDuring an interrogation by Emerson and the District Attorney, Alex Rodin, Barr writes &quot;Get Jack Reacher&quot; on a notepad. Reacher is a drifter and former U.S. Army Military Police Corps officer. Reacher later arrives in Pittsburgh after seeing a news report about Barr and the shooting. Emerson and Robin deny ReacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s request to view the evidence, but agree to let him see Barr, who was brutally attacked by fellow inmates while being transported and is now in a coma. While there, he meets BarrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defense attorney, counselor Helen Rodin, the DAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter, who is trying to save Barr from the death penalty.\n\nSoftware :AnyDVD\n\nCompression :No\n\nFile :DVD9 Full\n\nLanguage :Ita / Eng\n\nSub :Ita/Eng\n\nExtra :Yes\n\nMenÃƒÂ¹: Yes\n\nSize :6,17 GB\n\nFile :Folder\n\n Use NERO to burn .iso, burn to DVD a low speed for best results, or use DEAMON TOOLS to mount .iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29750e04b6146807d65ca3b15268b60891924430","amp;dn":"Jack+Reacher+2012+DVD9+ENG+ITA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29750e04b6146807d65ca3b15268b60891924430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,117,14,4,182,20,104,7,214,92,163,177,82,104,182,8,145,146,68,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
