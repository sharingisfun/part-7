Now, the author uses the same \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;take-no-prisoners\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; attitude in his deliciously funny and shockingly delectable audiobook, sure to delight gourmands and philistines alike. From his first oyster in the Gironde, to his lowly position as a dishwasher in a honky-tonk fish restaurant in Provincetown, from the kitchen of the Rainbow Room atop Rockefeller Center, to drug dealers in the East Village, from Tokyo to Paris and back to New York again, Bourdain\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s tales of the kitchen are as passionate as they are unpredictable. Kitchen Confidential will make your mouth water while your belly aches with laughter. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll beg the chef for more, please. \n\n\n             ****************************************************\n\nIf you like audio books please buy some.
