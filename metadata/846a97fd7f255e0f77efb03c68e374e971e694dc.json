He runs away, taking only a gem-eyed doll he calls Junky, &amp; joins a carnival. Finding acceptance at last, Horty never dreams that Junky is more than a toy, nor does he realize that a threat far greater than his cruel father inhabits the carnival &amp; has been searching for Horty longer than he has been alive.\nThough less well-known than Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke or Robert A. Heinlein, Theodore Sturgeon (1918-85) is even more important to the development of literary &amp; humanistic science fiction. He received the Hugo, Nebula, &amp; International Fantasy Awards, &amp; the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award. The Dreaming Jewels (1950) was his first novel.--Cynthia Ward\nThis book was also published as &quot;Synthetic Man&quot;.\n\nRead by Paul Michael Garcia\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: Variable\nUnabridged\n\nLength: 6 hrs and 18 mins\nRelease Date:29/09/2009\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:846a97fd7f255e0f77efb03c68e374e971e694dc","amp;dn":"Theodore+Sturgeon+-+The+Dreaming+Jewels+%28Synthetic+Man%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"846a97fd7f255e0f77efb03c68e374e971e694dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,106,151,253,127,37,94,15,119,239,176,60,104,227,116,233,113,230,148,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
