Twelve basic questions give copyright law experts from more than forty countries the opportunity to provide answers related to their national law on the following matters: categories of works and subject matter, eligibility conditions, duration, â€œusersâ€™ rights,â€ the three-step test, misuse, differentiations between categories of right holders, TPM, and relations of copyright law to other legal areas such as fundamental rights, competition law, consumer protection law, media law etc. The standardized form of the reports makes it easy to see the impacts of copyright law in the industrialized countries as well as in emerging economies; in common-law and civil-law approaches; in countries of the Andean Community and of the European Union, as well as in countries that are not party to the WIPO Treaties. A detailed preliminary chapter provides an approachable overview of issues and results. This chapter also discusses the voice of academia, represented by the European Copyright Code of the â€œWittem Group.â€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eebcfabb235b9b93b7ba880ff1535646e643ecd","amp;dn":"Balancing+Copyright+%282012%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eebcfabb235b9b93b7ba880ff1535646e643ecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,235,207,171,178,53,185,185,59,123,168,128,255,21,53,100,110,100,62,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
