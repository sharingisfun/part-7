And boy, did she luck out. She found a quietÃ¢â‚¬â€and smokin' hot!Ã¢â‚¬â€librarian looking for marriage. Unfortunately, there was a tiny mix-up at the printerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and aside from the sexy pic, Natalie's perfect man is everything she doesn't want! \n\nMax Dorset is a damn good lawyer who has no time for anything that isn't work. Marriage and relationships? No, thanks. But he offers Natalie a tantalizing temptation. Because even if he isn't her Mr. RightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦he might just be her perfect Mr. Tonight!\n\nKaren Foley - Make Me Melt \n\nHot to the touchÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nTwelve years ago, a teenage Caroline Banks slipped into Jason Cooper's bed, intending to seduce him and all of his tattooed hotness. She failed. Since then, she's wrapped herself in remote iciness, keeping her distance from both him and her home. But then JasonÃ¢â‚¬â€now a mouthwateringly sexy U.S. MarshalÃ¢â‚¬â€shows up suddenly with the news that Caroline's father has been shot and she is now under Jason's protection. \n\nCaroline never knew just how much she tempted him. And now, even with her aloofness, Jason can barely keep himself under control. Because that heatÃ¢â‚¬â€that fiery sexual attractionÃ¢â‚¬â€is stronger than ever. His job is to keep her safe, and not let himself fall into the flames. But the fire started so long ago won't be contained any longerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\nLeslie Kelly - Double Take \n\nGetting under her skinÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nWhen her research about orgasms goes viral, sex therapist Lindsey Smith needs a place to lie low. Substitute teaching on Wild Boar Island, Michigan, promises not only privacy, but an opportunity to not think about sex. Which, thanks to the town's too-tasty police chief, lasts exactly one second. \n\nAfter the dangerous streets of Chicago, Mike Santori figured the island was a safe, sane place to settle down. Getting hot for the new teacher wasn't in the plan. Especially when he discovers that Lindsey is more than she claims to be. Mike decides to use every sexy trick in the book to strip Lindsey of her defenses and reveal all of her secrets. It's a wickedly sensuous journey, one that pushes both of them beyond their limitsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦to the heart of their desires.\n\nSusanna Carr - Wild Weekend \n\nOne small gamble. \n\nOne BIG (sexy) payoff! \n\nBank manager Christine Pearson is dismayed when she finds her old &quot;bucket list.&quot; After ten years, nothing is crossed off. Nothing. So she does the sensible thingÃ¢â‚¬â€ditches her &quot;reliable&quot; shoes, grabs some kick-ass heels and hits Vegas! But the second she sees the tall glass of sexiness heading her way, Christine's list is suddenly updatedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦to include one wicked night with Travis Cain. \n\nBut when her naughty one-nighter shows up in her small town, Christine panics. After all, she's Sensible Christine. Not Christine-Who-Did-Sexy-Things-with-a-Scrumptious-Stranger. The weird part is that Travis keeps behaving as if she stole something important from him. Something valuable. But until he tells her the truth, Naughty Christine will take advantage of itÃ¢â‚¬â€and him. Because now her bucket list has gone from mildÃ¢â‚¬Â¦to wild!\n\nFormat: EPUB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a1d8f5b338b5464d68cff463000e85c621e18e0","amp;dn":"Harlequin+Blaze+-+May+2014+%28Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a1d8f5b338b5464d68cff463000e85c621e18e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,29,143,91,51,139,84,100,214,140,255,70,48,0,232,92,98,30,24,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
