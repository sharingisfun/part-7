Eager for her family, a fresh start and some fun, she doesn't count on being rescued by the chief of police her very first night back in town. Drew is everything she's not looking forÃ¢â‚¬Â¦so why is she still so attracted to him? \n\nAfter a brief, forbidden rendezvous at her brother's wedding, Drew Miller expects Liz to return to New Mexico and stay there. He's searching for someone to settle down with, not a casual fling with his best friend's sister. But when they're stuck together on the annual Kowalski camping trip, things start going a little sideways. Keeping their hands off each other proves just as impossible as keeping their secret from becoming public knowledge. \n\nAmid family, mud and melted marshmallow, Liz and Drew try to fight what's growing between them. But a little time alone, a lot of chemistry and too many opinions might be just what it takes to bring together two people so determined not to fall in love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c05ee503bf8e2f419ae391f50837d12f39654e5d","amp;dn":"Love+a+Little+Sideways+by+Shannon+Stacey+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c05ee503bf8e2f419ae391f50837d12f39654e5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,94,229,3,191,142,47,65,154,227,145,245,8,55,209,47,57,101,78,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
