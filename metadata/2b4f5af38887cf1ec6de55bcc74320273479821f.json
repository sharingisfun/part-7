Now you can quickly perform actions on the import, processing and display images, as well as their management - one shot, and for a series of shots. Enhanced correction tools, powerful features and flexibility in print settings accelerate the process work. Using Lightroom can reduce the time spent at the computer, and spend free time to work with the lens.\n\nAdditional Information:\nLightroom combines photos into &quot;collections&quot; - a virtual gathering of files, which can quickly do a search. It stores information about keywords, preview and metadata for each image file, and a centralized database (engine SQLite). Therefore, the database can be accessed at the photos, which are now in the archives on DVD. The size is significantly smaller than the Bridge, it runs faster and uses less memory. In general, Lightroom is targeted exclusively to photographers who are interested in processing and cataloging of photographs and not the other way around. Another feature of the package Photoshop Lightroom - division of work with images in separate stages. For each of them is a functional module with the appropriate set of tools and palettes settings.\n\nThe functionality of Lightroom include not only the RAW-converter and image processing, but also a powerful system of cataloging photographs, as well as tools for creating slide shows and web pages. Like many of today's RAW-converters, Lightroom uses the principle of non-destructive editing. This means that information about all transactions executed by the user and the settings stored in the Service file, while the original image remains intact. This approach allows us not only to minimize the likelihood of irreparable loss of the original processed images, but also allows you to create and print many different variants of the same image without the need to maintain an appropriate number of full-length graphic files quickly eat up free space on your hard drive. Upon completion of the work on the snapshot, you can save the processed version in a separate graphic file.\n\nThe program has five modules:\n- Downloading, cataloging and searching photos (Library)\n- Correction of color and tone of image parameters (Develop)\n- Creating a slide show (Slideshow)\n- Printing (Print)\n- Creating Web Pages for publishing collections of images on the Internet (Web)\n\nNew features:\n- Local adjustment brush\n- Enhanced organizational tools\n- Extensible architecture\n- Support for multiple monitors\n- Upgraded integration with Adobe Photoshop CS5\n- Enhanced output sharpening\n- Support for 64-bit Windows and Mac OS.\n[Collapse]\nWhat's New in This Release:\nLightroom 3,5 and 6,5 Camera Raw are now available as release candidates on Adobe Labs. The label &quot;release candidate&quot; means that this update is well tested but would benefit from additional testing community before it is distributed automatically to all of our clients. The final version of Lightroom 3.5 and Camera Raw 6,5 may have additional corrections or camera support.\n\nFuji FinePix F600EXR\nOlympus E-P3\nOlympus E-PL3\nOlympus E-PM1\nPanasonic DMC-G3\nPanasonic DMC-GF3\nPhase One IQ140\nPhase One IQ160\nPhase One P40 +\nPhase One P65 +\nSony Alpha NEX-C3\nSony SLT-A35\nHasselblad &quot;FFF&quot; files created by the software Hasselblad Phocus for supported models are also now supported.
