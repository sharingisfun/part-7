Hibernate, the most popular Java persistence tool, provides automatic and transparent object/relational mapping so it's a snap to work with SQL databases in Java applications. Hibernate conforms to the new EJB 3.0 and Java Persistence 1.0 standards.\nJava Persistence with Hibernate explores Hibernate by developing an application that ties together hundreds of individual examples. You'll immediately dig into the rich programming model of Hibernate 3.2 and Java Persistence, working through queries, fetching strategies, caching, transactions, conversations, and more. You'll also appreciate the well-illustrated discussion of best practices in database design, object/relational mapping, and optimization techniques.\n\n- O/R mapping concepts\n- Get started with Hibernate and Java Persistence\n- Efficient database application design\n- Comprehensive Hibernate and Java Persistence reference\n- Unmatched breadth and depth\n\nThe book ends with detailed coverage of JBoss Seam, a revolutionary web application framework for Java EE that builds on EJB 3.0, JavaServer Faces, and Hibernate concepts\n\nAuthor - Christian Bauer and Gavin King\nPublisher - Manning Publications Co.\nYear release - 2006\nGenre - Educational\nFormat - pdf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49eb26aa679c7603bb357f89262805716f5ac95a","amp;dn":"Java+Persistence+With+Hibernate.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49eb26aa679c7603bb357f89262805716f5ac95a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,235,38,170,103,156,118,3,187,53,127,137,38,40,5,113,111,90,201,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
