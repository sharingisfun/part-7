Small price to pay, however.\n\nIf you happen to get a &quot;Unable to parse the package&quot; error upon install, check the file against the checksum of the torrent. If it doesn't match, redownload because its corrupted.\n\nSeed, protest SOPA, and have a good day.\n\n~andersonrclark","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b7022513056221cf6a1a568481e15df63f266f1","amp;dn":"Wolfram%7CAlpha+1.0.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b7022513056221cf6a1a568481e15df63f266f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,112,34,81,48,86,34,28,246,161,165,104,72,30,21,223,99,242,102,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
