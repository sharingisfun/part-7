After building a strong reputation from live shows and their first self titled EP, they released the massive &quot;Secrets Of The Universe&quot; EP in June 2006, which gave us two of the biggest tracks on Triple J and community radio last year: &quot;45 &amp; Rising&quot; and &quot;Shadows&quot;. Since then they have been touring the country and building a following that resulted in sold out shows everywhere they have played including The Metro (wall to wall dancing) in Sydney and The Prince in Melbourne just a few months ago\nAnd now, the long awaited debut album is upon us: &quot;Dystopia&quot; Vincent, Andy &amp; newest addition Dan (ex VALENTINOS) have delivered beyond expectations.\nTheir masterful blend of electro &amp; indie with insanely catchy songwriting will make genres and comparisons irrelevant, their appeal is that broad\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:852febd343521c37bbb02b0619aac05d537205eb","amp;dn":"Midnight+Juggernauts+-+2007+-+Dystopia+%5BLE-2CD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"852febd343521c37bbb02b0619aac05d537205eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,47,235,211,67,82,28,55,187,176,43,6,25,170,192,93,83,114,5,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
