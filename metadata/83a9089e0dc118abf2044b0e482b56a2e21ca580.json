The band was formed in 1983 by step-sisters Kristin Hersh (vocals/guitar) and Tanya Donelly (guitar/vocals), who were both at high school at the time. Initially called Kristin Hersh And The Muses, the line-up was completed by bassist Elaine Adamedes and drummer Becca Blumen, who eventually gave way to Leslie Langston and David Narcizo respectively.\n\nThrowing Muses:\n\n1. The Real Ramona - 1991\n2. In A Doghouse - 1998 (Disc 1-2)\n3.
