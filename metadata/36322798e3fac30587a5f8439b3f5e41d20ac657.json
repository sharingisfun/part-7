The film starred Dolly Parton and Burt Reynolds and also featured Noah Beery, Jr., Jim Nabors, Charles Durning, Dom DeLuise, Robert Mandan, Lois Nettleton, Theresa Merritt, Barry Corbin, Mary Jo Catlett, and Mary Louise Wilson.\n\nDurning was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the Texas governor. Golden Globe nominations went to the film for Best Motion Picture (Comedy or Musical) and Parton for Best Actress in a Motion Picture (Comedy or Musical).\n\n\nPlot\n\nThe plot is basically the same as that of the stage production, with one significant difference. In the original, Ed Earl and Miss Mona had had a one-night stand fifteen years earlier, but in the film they maintain an ongoing affair.\n\nThe relationship in the film brings about not only the accusatory scene, when the sheriffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½disappointed that Mona has broken her promise to close the Chicken Ranch down long enough for things to cool offÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½calls her a whore, but also the happy ending, when he proposes marriage to Mona, even though that might endanger his chances to be elected as a state legislator. (The epilogue comments state that he is elected anyway.)\n\nThe house used in the film is located at Universal Studios in Hollywood and can be viewed as part of the backlot tram tour. (It was also seen in the Ghost Whisperer television series episode &quot;The Lost Boys.&quot;) The inspiration for the set came from a real ranchhouse located outside Austin, Texas, which is featured in scenes from the movie.\n\nThe role of Melvin P. Thorpe (portrayed by Dom DeLuise) is based on Marvin Zindler, an eccentric consumer reporter for Houston's KTRK-TV.\n\nCast\n\nBurt Reynolds as Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd\nDolly Parton as Mona Stangley\nDom DeLuise as Melvin P.

Two additional Parton compositions appear in the film: &quot;Sneakin' Around&quot;, performed as a duet with Parton and Reynolds, and a two-stanza version Parton's 1973 composition &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;. The film version of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; -- the original recording having been a U.S. country chart topper for Parton in the spring of 1974 -- was released as a single in July 1982, and again reached number one on the U.S. country singles chart. (It also was a mid-level hit on Billboard pop and adult contemporary charts.) An altered version of Hall's &quot;Hard Candy Christmas&quot;, in which Parton sings both the chorus and the verses of the song (as opposed to the film version, which is partially sung by some of the other female cast members), was also released as a single, reaching the top-ten on the country singles chart in late 1982.\n\nParton wrote several additional new songs for the film which were ultimately not used, including &quot;Down At The Chicken Ranch&quot; and &quot;Where Stallions Run&quot; -the latter was filmed (performed by Reynolds), but cut prior to the film's release. It was restored for the network television broadcast of the film, as the film was too short for its time slot after the censors finished their broadcast edits and additional material was needed. Parton recorded two of the deleted songs, &quot;A Gamble Either Way&quot;, and &quot;A Cowboy's Ways&quot; (a reworking of &quot;Where Stallions Run&quot;), and included them on her 1983 album Burlap &amp; Satin.\n\nFilm censorship\n\nThe film version presented some difficulties for Universal, particularly with advertising for the film. In 1982, the word whorehouse was considered obscene in parts of the United States, resulting in the film being renamed The Best Little Cathouse in Texas in some print ads, while television ads were either banned outright in some areas, or the offending word was censored. During interviews, Parton sometimes referred to the film as The Best Little Chicken House in Texas.\n\nThe film is sometimes accused of bowing to then-current racial attitudes by showing the sole black football player dancing with Ruby Rae, the sole black prostitute, although the latter also appears in a later scene in a tryst with a different, white, football player.\n\nTrivia\n\nOther people that were up for Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton's roles in the film included Willie Nelson for the role of Ed Earl Dodd and Barbara Mandrell and Crystal Gayle for the role of Miss Mona Stangley.\n\nThe exterior of the Chicken Ranch was built on the Universal lot where the Bates house from Psycho originally stood. The Bates house was moved to a more permanent location when filming began on Psycho II.\n\nIn terms of box-office, The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas was the most successful movie-musical of the 1980s.\n\nThe film went over budget because of the various production problems. Several directors came and went, the script was always being rewritten and Dolly Parton wrote several more songs than were eventually included.\n\nThe Chicken Ranch house went on to be the Firefly residence in House of 1000 Corpses.\n\nThe courthouse scene was not filmed in La Grange but in the near by town of Hallettsville, Texas.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36322798e3fac30587a5f8439b3f5e41d20ac657","amp;dn":"The+Best+Little+Whorehouse+in+Texas+%28Complete+-+Extras%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36322798e3fac30587a5f8439b3f5e41d20ac657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,50,39,152,227,250,195,5,135,165,248,67,155,63,94,65,210,10,198,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
