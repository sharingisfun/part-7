These consoles were \n   custom-built  for EMI's  studios and  have been  the centrepiece  of Abbey \n   Road's mastering rooms for more than 30 years. \n             \n   The TG12410's Tone Control and Filter modules have become secret weapons of \n   Abbey Road's  mastering engineers  and these  were studied  and modelled to \n   create the TG Mastering Pack. The plug-ins bring the smooth, musical  sound \n   of the original TG hardware to users of computer-based audio workstations. \n             \n   The TG12412 is a four-band, semi-parametric EQ with selectable  frequencies \n   and curve shapes on each band. The Shape control provides the shelving  and \n   variable  bell curves  from the  original module.  The TG12414  provides a \n   presence section and  low- and high-pass  filters. The presence  section is \n   the same as the presence EQ on the legendary TG12345 mixing console. \n             \n             \n   Key Features \n             \n             \n   Four band semi-parametric EQ  \n             \n   Selectable curve shapes on each band  \n             \n   Presence band and variable low- and high-pass filters  \n             \n   Exact replication of original TG controls  \n             \n   Automation and control surface support \n                                              \n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\n\nTested clean on a Windows 8 x64 virtual machine running with ESET Nod 32 5.2.9.1\nVirus database v.8361 (2013 05 22)\n\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n\n\n     1.Uninstall previous versions.                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     2.Unrar and install.                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n     3.Enjoy!                                                    \n\n\n\nIn case the Plugins don't show up in your VSTPlugins list\n\n                Google for Microsoft's free Visual C++ Runtimes:\n\n                             vcredist 2005 sp1\n                                   \n                                    and\n                             \n                             vcredist 2008 sp1\n\n             Install these runtimes, reboot and rescan your plugs\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\nSupport the software creators !\n\n________________\n\nPS: Help me to seed please, I have a 1 mbps bandwidth and this is the only release of Abbeyroadplugins.TG.Mastering.Pack on The Pirate Bay !\nPost feedback please as i'm a new uploader ! :)\n\n________________\n\nTHANKS TO TEAM AiR.\nABOD.
