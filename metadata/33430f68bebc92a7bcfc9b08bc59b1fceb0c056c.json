The scenery comes with unprecedented detail in effects , animations and awe inspiring views.\nThere are three main helipads in the scenery, the major one for sightseeing flights on the Canadian side, a smaller one very close to the Falls on the US side of the river and a medical rooftop pad on the Women and ChildrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hospital in Buffalo. Furthermore the package includes a bunch of International Airports and small airfields in the area in nice detail.\nUS Cities X is a series of city scenery for FSX that covers US cities created by LimeSim. Based on an extensive aerial image it will have all the major buildings and landmarks plus all the airports and heliports that are inside the covered areas.\nIt is clearly intended to fill the gap between the default scenery and very high dense city scenery such as Manhattan X, London VFR or Venice X. Because the file size is rather large due to the ground image it only includes one season (in most cases this is not a real issue) and no night textures. The VFR flights over these cities are mostly a day time affair anyway.\nFeatures:\n Aerial image coverage with up to 15cm/pix resolution (see attached Google Earth file)\n More than 850 major buildings included\n About 70,000 autogen buildings placed realistically\n Extremely realistic animations of the Falls\n Scheduled sightseeing boats going to the falls\n Many sightseeing around the Falls like:\n Skylon Tower with animated outside elevators\n Marineland with animated -2G tower (check out the Orcas!)\n Rainbow and other bridges crossing Niagara River\n Spanish Cable Car crossing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe WhirlpoolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n SkyWheel\n Captive Balloon (animated)\n Prospect viewing platform\n Hydro plants\n Major airports in and around the city are covered with new ground images (no new building structures added):\n KBUF ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Buffalo Niagara International Airport\n KIAG ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Niagara Falls International Airport\n D77 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Buffalo-Lancaster\n 0G0 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ North Buffalo Suburban Airport\n 9G0 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Buffalo Airfield\n CNJ3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Ft Erie\n NY49 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mesmer\n 77NY ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Pendleton Airpark\n 79NY ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Smith\n 62NZ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Lockport Cambria\n 85N ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Hollands Intl Field\n D80 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Olcott-Newfane\n 63NY ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Shear\n NY24 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Taylor\n 5 heliports:\n CNF9 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Niagara Helicopters (high detail)\n INK80 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Rainbow Helicopters Niagara (high detail)\n 7NK2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Buffalo Women and ChildrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hospital Helipad\n CNF7 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Niagara Falls Fire Station No.1\n CNJ3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Ft Erie Helipad (part of the airport)\n Sound effects like downtown- and highway traffic, the waterfalls...\n Traffic on most major roads\n Low price, very good value for money\n Includes a separate Scenery Density tool\nView aerial coverage &gt;&gt; Download KMZ-file &lt;&lt;\nGoogle Earth is required for viewing this file.
