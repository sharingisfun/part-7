But when his parents are murdered and he stands accused, he must flee for his life through the brutal Wild West. Take control of Billy and his hunter (Reverend Ray McCall), who believes he is Billy's judge, jury, and executioner. Each character has a different weapon set and different styles as they explore the ruthlessness that made the frontier a theater of war. Handle duels at nigh noon, nasty shootouts, and saloon brawls. Then challenge your friends as your band of money-hungry outlaws takes on theirs in a variety of game options and different terrain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d87c48ae9cc05f29d8b6d54ef9f0ec875b595ae0","amp;dn":"Call+of+Juarez+RF+Xbox+360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d87c48ae9cc05f29d8b6d54ef9f0ec875b595ae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,124,72,174,156,192,95,41,216,182,213,78,249,240,236,135,91,89,90,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
