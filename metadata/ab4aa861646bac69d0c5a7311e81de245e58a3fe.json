He flees through the sky to his home city to confront the ruler who betrayed him. And perhaps even to regain his lovely, powerful, and subversive wife, Venera, who he has not seen since she fled with the key to the artificial sun at the center of Virga, Candesce.\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab4aa861646bac69d0c5a7311e81de245e58a3fe","amp;dn":"Karl+Schroeder+-+Pirate+Sun+%28Virga+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab4aa861646bac69d0c5a7311e81de245e58a3fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,74,168,97,100,107,172,105,208,197,167,49,30,129,222,36,94,88,163,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
