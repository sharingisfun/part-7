Devoted to her husband, a pediatric oncologist at a major cancer hospital, their young son Henry, and the patients she sees in her therapy practice, her days are full of familiar things: she lives in the very New York apartment in which she was raised, and sends Henry to the school she herself once attended. Dismayed by the ways in which women delude themselves, Grace is also the author of a book You Should Have Known, in which she cautions women to really hear what men are trying to tell them. But weeks before the book is published a chasm opens in her own life: a violent death, a missing husband, and, in the place of a man Grace thought she knew, only an ongoing chain of terrible revelations. Left behind in the wake of a spreading and very public disaster, and horrified by the ways in which she has failed to heed her own advice, Grace must dismantle one life and create another for her child and herself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cb37b90d5d594c356acfd0855519f4883d4f29b","amp;dn":"You+Should+Have+Known+-+Jean+Hanff+Korelitz+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cb37b90d5d594c356acfd0855519f4883d4f29b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,179,123,144,213,213,148,195,86,172,253,8,85,81,159,72,131,212,242,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
