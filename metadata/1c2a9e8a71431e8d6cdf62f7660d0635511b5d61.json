OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Toole decreed that they should each play Hamlet afterwards under the direction of John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier in either London or New York, with a coin toss deciding who would be assigned which director and which city. OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Toole won London and Olivier in the toss, with Burton being assigned Gielgud and New York. OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Toole kept his part of the agreement, appearing as Hamlet under Olivier's direction in the premiere production of the Royal National Theatre later that year, and Burton approached producer Alexander H. Cohen and Gielgud about mounting a New York production\n\nBecause Burton disliked wearing period costumes, and for aesthetic reasons of his own, Gielgud conceived of a production performed in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“rehearsalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ setting with an incomplete set and the actors wearing what appeared to be street clothes (although the costumes were actually the result of continuous trial-and-error in rehearsals, with the actors bringing in countless variations of attire for Gielgud to consider). Gielgud also opted to depict the Ghost as a shadow against the back of the stage wall, voicing the character himself on tape (since he was unavailable while the production was in performance).\n\nThe production was a financial smash, achieving the longest run for the play in Broadway history at 137 performances, which broke the previous record set by Maurice Evans's GI Hamlet in the 1940s. The run's popularity was due in no small part to attention Burton received for his romance with Elizabeth Taylor, whom he married while the production was in Toronto pre-Broadway; crowds gathered outside the New York theater to get a glimpse of Burton, and sometimes Taylor, after the show. Burton was passionate, virile, calculating and sardonic in the role, varying his interpretation throughout the run, giving free rein to his magnificently effective[neutrality is disputed] voice, and wearing a v-necked black sweater or jacket and simple slacks. Burton's reviews in the title role were largely favorable and he received a Tony Award nomination for his performance. A distinguished aspect of the production was Hume CronynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s puckish performance as Polonius, which won him the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play. Eileen Herlie, who played Queen Gertrude, had already played the role in Laurence Olivier's Oscar-winning 1948 film version. Less favorably received were Linda Marsh as Ophelia and Alfred Drake as King Claudius, whom Gielgud had considered replacing with respectively Sarah Miles and either Harry Andrews or himself in rehearsals. (Gielgud did play the ghost of Hamlet's father as a disembodied voice, with only the Ghost's shadow seen.)\n\nBy contractual agreement, all prints of the film were to have been destroyed after its theatrical run. However, by chance, a single print was discovered in Burton's garage following his death, and his widow allowed it to be distributed on VHS, and later on DVD. The film was originally titled Hamlet, but the VHS and DVD covers read Richard Burton's Hamlet.\n\nCast\n\nHamlet - Richard Burton\nPolonius - Hume Cronyn\nClaudius - Alfred Drake\nGertrude - Eileen Herlie\nGuildenstern - William Redfield\nFirst Gravedigger - George Rose\nPlayer King - George Voskovec\nVoltemand - Philip Coolidge\nLaertes - John Cullum\nFrancisco/ Fortinbras - Michael Ebert\nReynaldo/Osric - Dillon Evans\nRosencrantz - Clement Fowler\nLucianus - Geoff Garland\nMarcellus/Priest - Barnard Hughes\nOphelia - Linda Marsh\nHoratio - Robert Milli\nCornelius/ Second Gravedigger/ English Ambassador - Hugh Alexander\nBernardo/Ensemble - Robert Burr\nPlayer Queen - Christopher Culkin\nEnsemble - Alex Giannini\nGhost - John Gielgud\nEnsemble - Claude Harz\nPlayer Prologue/Ensemble- John Hetherington\nEnsemble - Gerome Ragni\nEnsemble - Linda Seff\nGentleman - Richard L.
