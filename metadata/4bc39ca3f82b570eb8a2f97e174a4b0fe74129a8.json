Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore Kelp Forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful.\r\nScavenge, Craft, and Survive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter waking up in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft knives, lights, diving gear and personal water craft. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items.\r\nConstruct Underwater Habitats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean.\r\nDisrupt the Food Chain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators.\r\nFear the Night\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unawares in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see.\r\nShape the World\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Subnautica sea-floor is presented using a dynamic voxel terrain system. Dig caves to hide, store loot, or short-circuit cave systems. Impacts from vehicles, or even exploding creatures, will change the way the world looks.\r\nGo Below The Deep\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.\r\nOpen Development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet weekly or daily updates, see what the development team is working on, view real time change logs, and give feedback from inside the game. Subnautica Early Access development is open, and the development team wants to hear from you.\r\nAbout the Development Team\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubnautica is being created by Unknown Worlds, a small studio founded by Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire that traces its roots back to the 2003 Half-Life mod Natural Selection. The team is scattered around the globe, from the United States to the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic, Russia, Thailand, Australia, and many more places. There is a central office in San Francisco, California that serves as home base for the whole team","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bc39ca3f82b570eb8a2f97e174a4b0fe74129a8","amp;dn":"Subnautica+B.678+%28Build+33514%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bc39ca3f82b570eb8a2f97e174a4b0fe74129a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,195,156,163,248,43,87,14,184,162,249,126,23,74,75,15,231,65,41,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
