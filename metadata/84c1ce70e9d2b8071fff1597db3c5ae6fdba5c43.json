The group combines the\n  punky tunefulness and speedy rhythms of the Descendents with a heavy,\n  prog-influenced sound that owes more to the &quot;math rock&quot; and &quot;screamo&quot; scenes.\n  &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; begins with complex Rush-like start-stop unison fills, before\n  giving way to an ultra-catchy chorus that would make fellow Midwesterners\n  Cheap Trick smile, while &quot;Ohio Is for Lovers&quot; adds a healthy dose of guttural\n  throat-shredding over lyrics that examine love and death. &quot;Niki FM&quot; uses\n  metallic riffing and careening lead guitars to evoke a seemingly obsessive\n  relationship. Equal parts raging post-hardcore and gentle melodicism,\n  The Silence in Black and White is a dynamic, appealing emo album.\n  \n- Uploader Notes ------------------------------------------------------------ -\n\t\n  Dear Hawthorne Heights fans,\n  this is my own rip from original CD, extracted and remastered in my studio\n  because it's the golden album of Hawthorne Heights. The original recording\n  quality is not good and I decided to remaster the CD and upload exclusively\n  for you. You can now enjoy the best quality on the internet supplied by me.\n  I used the new LAME MP3 Encoder 3.99 and the best high quality settings for\n  MP3. All the tags are filled with information about the album. Please seed\n  as long as you can. I'm able to upload FLAC version too for the lovers.\n  Any feedback and comments are more than welcome! Thanks.\n  \n  HH_Fan - http://thepiratebay.se/user/HH_Fan\n  \n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01 Hawthorne Heights - Life on Standby                                 [4:11]\n  02 Hawthorne Heights - Dissolve and Decay\t\t\t\t [3:44]\n  03 Hawthorne Heights - Niki FM\t\t\t\t\t [3:59]\n  04 Hawthorne Heights - The Transition\t\t\t\t\t [4:04]\n  05 Hawthorne Heights - Blue Burns Orange\t\t\t\t [3:19]\n  06 Hawthorne Heights - Silver Bullet\t\t\t\t\t [4:03]\n  07 Hawthorne Heights - Screenwriting An Apology\t\t\t [3:43]\n  08 Hawthorne Heights - Ohio Is For Lovers\t\t\t\t [4:04]\n  09 Hawthorne Heights - Wake Up Call\t\t\t\t\t [4:02]\n  10 Hawthorne Heights - Sandpaper and Silk\t\t\t\t [3:36]\n  11 Hawthorne Heights - Speeding Up The Octaves\t\t\t [4:10]\n  \n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84c1ce70e9d2b8071fff1597db3c5ae6fdba5c43","amp;dn":"Hawthorne+Heights+-+The+Silence+in+Black+and+White+%28Remastered+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84c1ce70e9d2b8071fff1597db3c5ae6fdba5c43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,193,206,112,233,210,184,7,31,255,21,151,219,60,90,230,253,186,92,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
