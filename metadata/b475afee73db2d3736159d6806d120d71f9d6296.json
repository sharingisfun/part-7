A former television producer and journalist who has covered assignments from Washington to the Middle East, Silva fills The Marching Season with the political suspense that churns through present-day Northern Ireland. In 1998, as the Good Friday peace accords go into effect, world leaders hope for an end to the bloody Irish troubles. But terrorists are moving to shatter that fragile peace through a series of brutal assassinations. CIA officer Michael OsbourneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s job is to stop October, their deadliest hit man. As Osbourne tracks the elusive October, he begins to realize that an even more powerful organization is using the terrorists. In this world of espionage and counter-espionage, no place is safe, and no detail too small to ignore. Frank MullerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s narration swirls the currents of danger and deceit around each scene in SilvaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s compelling novel.\n\n  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\n  From danielsilvabooks.com:\n\nWith The Marching Season, Silva delivers his most entertaining novel yet-an electrifying tale of terror, revenge, and greed, straight out of tomorrow's headlines. \n\nIt is the first uncertain year of the peace process in Northern Ireland, a land ravaged by centuries of religious and political conflict. On a single night, a renegade group of Protestant extremists tries to turn back the hands of time with three savage acts of terrorism. Their goal: to shatter the peace and make certain Ulster remains forever part of the United Kingdom. \n\nRetired CIA officer Michael Osbourne, the hero of Mark of the Assassin, is lured back to the Agency after his father-in-law, former U.S. Senator Douglas Cannon, is nominated to be the new American ambassador to London. When Michael discovers that the Protestant gunmen have marked Cannon for execution, he sets in motion a deadly contest of wits and deception, which will determine whether the peace in Northern Ireland will survive and whether his father-in-law lives or dies. What Michael Osbourne does not realize is that he is a pawn in a much larger game. Once again, Michael's destiny is controlled by the Society, a secret order that uses its power and influence to foster global unrest for financial gain. And once again, he is matched against his personal bÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªte noire, Jean-Paul Delaroche, the world's most dangerous assassin, who slipped through Michael's fingers at the climax of The Mark of the Assassin. \n\nFilled with breathtaking plot twists, The Marching Season is a novel of power and intrigue, where appearance and reality are enemies and trust is betrayed as often as it is honored.\n\n  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\n  From Wiki:\n\nDaniel Silva (born 1960) is the best-selling American author of 11 thriller and espionage novels.
