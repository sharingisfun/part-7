He shouted the gospel, screamed the blues, all with a touch of aggressive, near-punk sneer. Success took long for Pickett, and every track on this hits CD caught the joy of achieving it and the pain and anger of waiting for it.\n\nWorking with R&amp;B\\&amp;#039;s finest producers (Jerry Wexler, Rick Hall, Gamble-Huff, Tom Dowd) and best sidemen (that\\&amp;#039;s Duane Allman\\&amp;#039;s guitar on \\&quot;A Man And A Half,\\&quot; and an impressive \\&quot;Hey Jude\\&quot;), Pickett turned fast (\\&quot;Land of 1000 Dances,\\&quot;) slow (\\&quot;634-5789,\\&quot; \\&quot;Mustang Sally,\\&quot;) hard (\\&quot;You Keep Me Hangin\\&amp;#039; On\\&quot; Staxifies the Vanilla Fudge arrangement!) soft (\\&quot;I Found A True Love\\&quot;), groovy (\\&quot;Mama Told Me Not to Come\\&quot;) and even bubblegum (hear what happens to \\&quot;Sugar Sugar\\&quot;) into Memphis/Muscle Shoals soul stew. Legendary Philadelphia DJ Hy Lit covered it when calling Pickett\\&amp;#039;s music \\&quot;psychedelic soulization.\\&quot;\n\nThe hits, some of the 60s sweatiest and intense, are all here, ironically ending at the beginning with three songs Pickett recorded with the Falcons (his hit \\&quot;If You Need Me,\\&quot; is here, but not \\&quot;You\\&amp;#039;re So Fine.\\&quot;) His voice is powerful and raw, raising the roof, testifying about the infamous \\&quot;midnight hour,\\&quot; but without the controlled fury he gave the rest, and best, of his music. This is R&amp;B coming at you 90 miles an hour, three minutes at a time, and is an essential set from a soul survivor. (Amazon)\n\n\n\n\n01.
