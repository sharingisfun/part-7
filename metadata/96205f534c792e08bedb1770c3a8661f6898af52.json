In his most epic adventure yet, Robson s journey spans 14 countries and four continents. Along the way, he does more than just catch a lot of fish! Like never before, Robson also experiences the heart and soul of the local communities for whom fishing is not a hobby...it s survival. Amongst many things, Robson finds himself attempting to settle a score with an old nemesis in Kenya; practicing an extraordinary Octopus-fishing technique in China; dicing with death in Japan and coming face to face with the ferocious Bull Shark in Florida. Doing battle with some of the deadliest, strongest, heaviest and fastest, will he need a bigger boat?!\n\n\n1)  Zimbabwe \nThe actor begins his journey at Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, where he hunts down the vundu catfish, known locally as the `steam train' because of its strength. He also examines the kapenta fishing industry, which is integral to life in the country because it provides protein for the low-income populace. In Victoria Falls, he has to prove his courage when angling for tiger fish in a deep pool called the `boiling pot', before braving the Zambezi white-water rapids\n\n2)  Kenya \nThe actor heads for the east coast of Kenya, where the Indian Ocean offers some of the best game fishing in the world. Joining a local expert, he encounters a large wahoo fish while searching for the elusive dorado, before going back to basics to learn a traditional fishing technique that consists of just lines and bare hands. Robson also visits Lake Victoria, where an unusual method is employed to catch whitebait\n\n3)  China \nThe actor casts off in the Chinese regions of Zhejiang and Xiu Shan, where fishing is a very important skill. At Qiando Lake he joins 100 locals in trying to land a bighead carp and samples the revered catch. More culinary experiences await as a result of Green's hunt for octopus, and he tries his hand at cormorant fishing - but has trouble restraining his bird's constant efforts to escape\n\n4)  Sri Lanka \nThe actor continues his journey in Sri Lanka, where fishing is the lifeblood of the coastal communities. He visits the Kandy Perahera festival, where he observes the traditional water-cutting ceremony, and heads for the seaside town of Koggala to join the Weligama stilt fishermen, who have practised their technique of balancing on poles for decades. He also confronts his dislike of the dark at the Uda Walawe national park, and tries to catch a mahseer in the Mahaweli river\n\n5)  Brazil \nRobson travels to Brasil where he attempts to catch deadly black piranhas in the Amazon river. He then makes his way to Rio Negro where he encounters pink river dolphins, and goes to the remote fishing community of Jaraua. The Amazon is the biggest forest in the world, covering more than half of Brazil. From the 3 meter long Brazilian Catfish to the 3ft long Peacock Bass, if Robson goes hungry in the Amazon, he'll only have himself to blame.\n\n6)  Senegal \nRobson travels to the coast of West Africa where he makes some mammoth catches and there is also a surprise appearance from a large shark. Located on the very west of the African continent, Senegalese natives are blessed with great access to the seas of the Atlantic down their entire west coast. After Robson has fished in Senegal he will travel south to the Bilagos Islands off Guinea-Bissau.\n\n7)  Cuba \nRobson travels to Cuba, where he discovers an unexpected fishing wonderland. Robson attempts to catch the spectacular tarpon and the grouper. Robson Green is on a mission to discover the weird, the wonderful and the way-off-limits of the fishing world. Chasing some of the most elusive and terrifying fish on the planet.\n\n8)  Japan \nRobson travels to to Japan, where he learns more about a culture obsessed with fish. He has a difficult time when he attempts to catch and eat the highly poisonous fugu. He also goes in search of the tiny ayu, some bottom-dwelling sea snails and the oilfish. On the shores of Tokyo Bay lie Yokohama, Kawasaki and Tokyo. The bay makes for a surreal combination of natural beauty with kilometres of coastlines. Robson will be heading out on the bay with local fishermen.\n\n9)  Panama \nRobson travels to to Panama in Central America where he goes in search of peacock bass, tarpon, dorado, sierra mackerel and billfish. Robson is on a mission to discover the weird, the wonderful and the way-off-limits of the fishing world. Chasing some of the most elusive and terrifying fish on the planet.\n\n10)  India \nRobson travels to India but is unable to catch any of the huge fish that are reported to occupy the surrounding waters. Robson then decides to go to the Maldives where he ends up encountering some rare bad weather. An amazing country for some of the world's largest fish, India is the perfect place for Robson's next fishing expedition. Robson will enjoy a spot of mackerel fishing with Chinese fishing nets and Giant Catfish fishing off an Indian houseboat.\n\n11)  Florida \nRobson travels to Florida where anglers from all over the world gather to fish the thousands of miles of sea andinland waters. Robson manages to catch some good- sized grouper, a tilapia and a giant sailfish before going in search of the ultimate catch.\n\n12)  USA \nRobson travels to California where he wrestles with a big blue shark.
