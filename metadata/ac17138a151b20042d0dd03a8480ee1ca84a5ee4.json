Ingredients are left to shine. . . . So, if on your visit, I hand you an apron, your work will be easy. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll start with primo ingredients, a little flurry of activity, perhaps a glass of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, and soon weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be carrying platters out the door. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have as much fun setting the table as we have in the kitchen. Four double doors along the front of the house open to the outsideÃ¢â‚¬â€so handy for serving at a long table under the stars (or for cooling a scorched pan on the stone wall). Italian Philosophy 101: la casa aperta, the open house.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€from the Introduction \n \nIn all of Frances MayesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bestselling memoirs about Tuscany, food plays a starring role. This cuisine transports, comforts, entices, and speaks to the friendly, genuine, and improvisational spirit of Tuscan life. Both cooking and eating in Tuscany are natural pleasures. In her first-ever cookbook, Frances and her husband, Ed, share recipes that they have enjoyed over the years as honorary Tuscans: dishes prepared in a simple, traditional kitchen using robust, honest ingredients.\n            \nA toast to the experiences theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had over two decades at Bramasole, their home in Cortona, Italy, this cookbook evokes days spent roaming the countryside for chestnuts, green almonds, blackberries, and porcini; dinner parties stretching into the wee hours,  and garden baskets tumbling over with bright red tomatoes. \n            \nLose yourself in the transporting photography of the food, the people, and the place, as FrancesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrical introductions and headnotes put you by her side in the kitchen and raising a glass at the table. From Antipasti (starters) to Dolci (desserts), this cookbook is organized like a traditional Italian dinner.\n            \nThe more than 150 tempting recipes include:\nÃ‚Â·         Fried Zucchini Flowers\nÃ‚Â·         Red Peppers Melted with Balsamic Vinegar \nÃ‚Â·         Potato Ravioli with Zucchini, Speck, and Pecorino\nÃ‚Â·         Risotto Primavera\nÃ‚Â·         Pizza with Caramelized Onions and Sausage\nÃ‚Â·         Cannellini Bean Soup with Pancetta\nÃ‚Â·         Little Veal Meatballs with Artichokes and Cherry Tomatoes\nÃ‚Â·         Chicken Under a Brick\nÃ‚Â·         Short Ribs, Tuscan-Style\nÃ‚Â·         DomenicaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rosemary Potatoes\nÃ‚Â·         Folded Fruit Tart with Mascarpone\nÃ‚Â·         Strawberry Semifreddo\nÃ‚Â·         Steamed Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Sauce\n \nFrances and Ed also share their tips on stocking your pantry, pairing wines with dishes, and choosing the best olive oil. Learn their time-tested methods for hand rolling pasta and techniques for coaxing the best out of seasonal ingredients with little effort. \n            \nThrow on another handful of pasta, pull up a chair, and languish in the rustic Italian way of life. \n\n\n\nBy Frances Mayes, Edward Mayes\nPublished by Clarkson Potter Publishers in 2012\nEPUB, Retail, 224 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac17138a151b20042d0dd03a8480ee1ca84a5ee4","amp;dn":"The+Tuscan+Sun+Cookbook+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac17138a151b20042d0dd03a8480ee1ca84a5ee4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,23,19,138,21,27,32,4,45,13,208,58,132,128,238,28,168,74,94,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
