Also if you use your PC to watch it, installing LAV Filter will help you a lot if you want to use KMPlayer or PotPlayer. However, MPC-HC (preferably in K-Lite Media Codec Pack) is the recommended. Many updated players have native support for the codec. To play on Android, use MX Player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cec905af8669814975d18eacdc7f44d3b2be986","amp;dn":"PixAndVideo+Alexis+Brill+Taking+Care+Of+The+Wife+720p+HEVC+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cec905af8669814975d18eacdc7f44d3b2be986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,236,144,90,248,102,152,20,151,93,24,234,205,199,244,77,59,43,233,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
