Formed by Pop and friend Daddy Long Legs in 1992, the group was first called Bang Chamber 8 before they lifted the name Bloodhound Gang from the '70s children's public television show 3-2-1 Contact. Calling Howard Stern a key influence, Pop designed the band to &quot;hurt everyone's feelings; it makes us feel better about ourselves.&quot; Naming one of the group's early demo tapes The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack to Hitler's Handicapped Helpers proved they meant it, but the Universal-associated label Cheese Factory Records shared the Gang's sense of humor and released their debut EP, Dingleberry Haze, in 1994.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Strictly For The Tardcore\n02.Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo\n03.The Ballad Of Chasey Lain\n04.Fire Water Burn\n05.The Bad Touch\n06.Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)\n07.Mope\n08.I Hope You Die\n09.Hell Yeah\n10.I Wish I Was Queer So I Could Get Chicks\n11.Kiss Me Where It Smells Funny\n12.Pennsylvania\n13.Along Comes Mary\n14.I'm The Least You Could Do\n15.Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss\n16.Farting With A Walkman On\n17.Why's Everybody Always Pickin' On Me\n18.Legend In My Spare Time\n19.Asleep At The Wheel\n20.No Hard Feelings\n21.Something Diabolical\n\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.The Inevitable Return Of The Great White Dope\n02.Ralph Wiggum\n03.Balls Out\n04.Fire Water Burn (Donkey Version)\n05.Magna Cum Nada\n06.Going Nowhere Slow\n07.Yummy Down On This\n08.Three Point One Four\n09.Boom\n10.Shut Up\n11.Your Only Friends Are Make Believe\n12.Rang Dang\n13.We Are The Knuckleheads\n14.Mama Say\n15.One Way\n16.Go Down\n17.No Rest For The Wicked\n18.Coo Coo Ca Choo\n19.It's Tricky\n20.Kids In America\n21.K.I.D.S.
