Just a very nice, mellow, pastoral psych-pop sound that might be a bit too lightweight for some listeners, but some of these songs (&quot;Christmas on Easter Island&quot;, &quot;The Sky Is a Glove&quot;) are just too gorgeous to resist. Basically, this is exactly what you'd expect an album called Treehouse Poetry by a band called Sad Lovers &amp; Giants to sound like. Now why this fantastic record went unnoticed? Since bands making ugly grunge rock were sadly ruling every freaking charts, TV and radio stations. \n\n\n1 Toy Planes in a Southern Sky   5:02 \n2 Lizard King   5:39 \n3 Still Restless   2:43 \n4 Parachute of Love   4:41 \n5 Christmas on Easter Island   5:10 \n6 Criminally Sane   3:30 \n7 Jungle of Lies   4:52 \n8 The Sky Is a Glove   5:44 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78de772ea6234e5532f8102f435468dab8c2b03b","amp;dn":"Sad+Lovers+and+Giants+-+Treehouse+Poetry+%5B1991%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78de772ea6234e5532f8102f435468dab8c2b03b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,222,119,46,166,35,78,85,50,248,16,47,67,84,104,218,184,194,176,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
