In the course of his trial, it becomes clear that what is at stake :\n : is more than one man's guilt. For on San Piedro, memories grow as thickly  :\n : as cedar trees and the fields of ripe strawberries - memories of a charmed :\n : love affair between a white boy and a Japanese girl; memories of land      :\n : desired, paid for, and lost. Above all, San Piedro is haunted by the memory:\n : of what happened to its Japanese residents during World War II, when an    :\n : entire community was sent into exile while its neighbours watched.         :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d7ac6b7e3a8e5cf27309ae3298b56538e619637","amp;dn":"David+Guterson+Snow+Falling+on+Cedars+2009+Retail+EPUB+eBook-Bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d7ac6b7e3a8e5cf27309ae3298b56538e619637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,122,198,183,227,168,229,207,39,48,154,227,41,139,86,83,142,97,150,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
