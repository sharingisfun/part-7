This series ain't your father's Archie, that's for sure! Tackling two major parallel universes - one in which Archie marries Betty, the other in which he marries Veronica - and the consequences of when they merge, along with more serious issues than is typical of Archie Comics, this highly-praised series is just now entering its 4th year, so this is everything you need to get caught up! Also a few of the later issues were not available on TPB so that has been rectified with this release. Enjoy and please seed! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c751aca4d7d78111998bbb55d5679464904d3dd2","amp;dn":"Life+With+Archie+01-32+%282010-Ongoing%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c751aca4d7d78111998bbb55d5679464904d3dd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,81,172,164,215,215,129,17,153,139,187,85,213,103,148,100,144,77,61,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
