And one that I ultimately had to leave.&quot; Trained to become a geisha from the age of five, Iwasaki would live among the other &quot;women of art&quot; in Kyoto's Gion Kobu district and practice the ancient customs of Japanese entertainment. She was loved by kings, princes, military heroes, and wealthy statesmen alike. But even though she became one of the most prized geishas in Japan's history, Iwasaki wanted more: her own life. And by the time she retired at age twenty-nine, Iwasaki was finally on her way toward a new beginning.\n\nGeisha, a Life is her story -- at times heartbreaking, always awe-inspiring, and totally true.\n\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35fd53b94f78ba71470a9abef860c2280fbb840a","amp;dn":"Geisha%2C+A+Life+by+Mineko+Iwasaki+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35fd53b94f78ba71470a9abef860c2280fbb840a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,253,83,185,79,120,186,113,71,10,154,190,248,96,194,40,15,187,132,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
