The Constitution grants each American the right to self-determination, to be protected from others whose actions are destructive to their lives and property. Yet as Kibbe persuasively shows, the political and corporate establishment consolidates its power by infringing upon our independenceÃ¢â‚¬â€from taxes to regulations to spyingÃ¢â‚¬â€ultimately eroding the ideals, codified in law, that have made the United States unique in history.\n\nKibbe offers a surefire plan for reclaiming our inalienable rights and regaining control of our lives, grounded in six simple rules:\n\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hurt people: Free people just want to be left alone, not hassled or harmed by someone else with an agenda or designs over their life and property.\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stuff: AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s founders fought to ensure property rights and our individual right to the fruits of our labors.\nTake responsibility: Liberty takes responsibility. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sit around waiting for someone else to solve your problems.\nWork for it: For every action there is an equal reaction. Work hard and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be rewarded.\nMind your own business: Free people live and let live.\nFight the power: Thanks to the Internet and the decentralization of knowledge, there are more opportunities than ever to take a stand against corrupt authority.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f85f4a59c330ec8b807fadc554a6a463d362a50","amp;dn":"Don%27t+Hurt+People+and+Don%27t+Take+Their+Stuff+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f85f4a59c330ec8b807fadc554a6a463d362a50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,133,244,165,156,51,14,200,184,7,250,220,85,74,106,70,61,54,42,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
