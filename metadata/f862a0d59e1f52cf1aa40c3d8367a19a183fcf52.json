With this collection, posterity may now play a nearly comprehensive collection of the best classic games (even the translated and obscure ones) without tons of research or sorting through full ROM collections that are 90% crud.\r\n\r\nPlease seed and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f862a0d59e1f52cf1aa40c3d8367a19a183fcf52","amp;dn":"Golden+Age+of+Video+Games+-+Age+of+the+Cartridge+v2.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f862a0d59e1f52cf1aa40c3d8367a19a183fcf52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,98,160,213,158,31,82,207,26,164,12,61,131,103,161,154,24,63,207,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
