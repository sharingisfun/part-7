In many\nways, Weezer have always been the unlikeliest of pop rock bands, earning major\nradio and video play for leftfield singles like &quot;Undone The Sweater Song&quot; and\n&quot;Buddy Holly,&quot; songs that hardly seem calculated to become radio hits. It is\nexactly this &quot;uncalculated&quot; quality that the band returns to on their eighth\nalbum. Hurley is as warm and embracing as the glowing smile on actor Jorge\nGarcia's face that graces the cover, as ragged and endearing as fan favorite\nPinkerton, as bold and hooky and open as &quot;Pork and Beans.&quot; In other words,\nHurley is in the classic tradition of the best Weezer albums, clever and\nconfessional and quirky and hugely sing along.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nInfo:\n\nLike it?
