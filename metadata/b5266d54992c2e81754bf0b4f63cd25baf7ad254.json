He was given a life sentence before he was even born, and grew up within prison walls. His mother died when he was just six years old, and he was placed in the general population. Later, when he incurred the wrath of the warden, he was locked in a dank, solitary cell for a decade. There, he learned to survive by feasting on rats, and to train his body and mind using techniques of his own devising. When he was eventually brought back into the general population of the prison, he had become a legend, and soon battled his way to the top of the prison gangs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5266d54992c2e81754bf0b4f63cd25baf7ad254","amp;dn":"Batman%3A+Vengeance+of+Bane+I+%26amp%3B+II+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5266d54992c2e81754bf0b4f63cd25baf7ad254","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,38,109,84,153,44,46,129,117,75,240,180,246,60,210,91,175,122,210,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
