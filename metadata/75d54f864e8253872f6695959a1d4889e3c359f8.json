Furthermore, her style - a sort of ultra-sophisticated take on Carole King and Elton John - was perfect for the times. But, for various reasons (an aversion to self-promotion, in particular), she never consolidated her initial success, and settled instead for a small, but loyal cult following, both in North America and Europe. Chi (pronounced &quot;shy&quot;) Coltrane (b.Nov 16, 1948 Racine, Wisconsin) was one of seven children born to a Canadian mother, and a German violinist father. She studied a number of instruments as a child, and gave her first piano recital at 12. In 1970, she formed Chicago Coltrane, playing blues, funk and gospel in local clubs and bars.She was signed to Columbia in 1972, on the strength of a six-song demo tape, and her first album, the entirely self-written Chi Coltrane appeared that year. In November 1972, her first single 'Thunder and Lightning' reached number 17.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Thunder And Lightning\n02.You Were My Friend\n03.Myself To You\n04.Go Like Elijah\n05.Feeling Good\n06.The Wheel Of Life\n07.Who Ever Told You\n08.It's Not Easy\n09.Let It Ride\n10.Hallelujah\n11.Fly Away Bluebird\n12.I Will Not Dance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75d54f864e8253872f6695959a1d4889e3c359f8","amp;dn":"Chi+Coltrane+-+The+Best+Of++%282004%29+CBR320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75d54f864e8253872f6695959a1d4889e3c359f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,213,79,134,78,130,83,135,47,102,149,149,154,29,72,137,227,195,89,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
