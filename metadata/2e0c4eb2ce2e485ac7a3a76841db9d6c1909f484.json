The three emu chicks are beginning to wreak havoc, the camels are rapidly outgrowing their backyard enclosure and Pete, the southern hairy-nosed wombat, is proving to be quite a handful.\r\nTo help, Brolga's looking to move some of the animals to his 80-acre sanctuary. But, a clash with his old sparring partner, Roger the alpha male kangaroo, has left Brolga on crutches and put all of his plans, including those for the new wildlife hospital, on hold.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen0.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c2/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen1.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/60/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen2.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/14/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen3.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8e/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen4.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen5.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bf/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen6.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fe/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen7.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8c/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen8.jpg\r\n\r\n  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen9.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/db/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen10.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/44/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen11.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen12.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/77/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen13.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e3/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen14.jpg\r\n\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/15/Kangaroo-Dundee-and-Other-Animals-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3009 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 2\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b079s2ph","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e0c4eb2ce2e485ac7a3a76841db9d6c1909f484","amp;dn":"BBC.Natural.World.2016.Kangaroo.Dundee.and.Other.Animals.2of2.72","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e0c4eb2ce2e485ac7a3a76841db9d6c1909f484","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,12,78,178,206,46,72,90,199,163,167,104,65,219,157,108,25,9,244,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
