It's a multi3 european version, you can choose English, French or German.\n\nX-COM UFO Defense Gold Edition includes two sets of executables, the old MS-DOS set and a new Windows 95 set.\n\nMy suggestion is that you try the Windows 95 method first, because, as a general rule, a native executable is better than an emulator.\nX-COM UFO Defense for Windows 95\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n-Create the folder that will contain the game (Ej. C:gamesxcom)\n-Decompress &quot;X-COM UFO Defense.7z&quot; to the previous folder. You'll need 7-zip for this task. Get it from http://7-zip.org/\n-Double-click on &quot;UFO Defense_Patched.exe&quot; to run the game. If that one doesn't work for you, try &quot;UFO Defense.exe&quot;. If that one doesn't work either, read the next section.\n\nX-COM UFO Defense for MS-DOS\n\nIf, for some reason, the Windows 95 executables don't work on your system, you'll have to go the DosBox way.\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n-Create the folder that will contain the game (Ej. C:gamesxcom)\n-Decompress &quot;X-COM UFO Defense.7z&quot; to the previous folder. You'll need 7-zip for this task. Get it from http://7-zip.org/\n-Download and install DosBox.\n\nThe most confortable option to run X-COM is to create a shortcut to DosBox that passes the location of the game's executable as an argument, &quot;c:gamesxcomufocd.bat&quot; in this case. What I'm asking you to do is Windows general culture, but if you don't know what I'm talking about, read this excellent tutorial.\n\nI'm not going to take up any more of your time. Enjoy this masterpiece!\n\n2010/06/02, trapacer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:274aab393d9442a7c1ba2d39216f5dbd5bdfbbf7","amp;dn":"%5BPC%5D+X-COM+UFO+Defense+Gold+Edition+%5Bby+trapacer%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"274aab393d9442a7c1ba2d39216f5dbd5bdfbbf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,74,171,57,61,148,66,167,193,186,45,57,33,111,93,189,91,223,187,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
