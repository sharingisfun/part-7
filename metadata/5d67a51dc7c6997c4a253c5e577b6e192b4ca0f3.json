She is the great-niece of legendary singer/actress Ethel Waters.\n\nCareer\n\nWaters enjoyed three major popÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“dance hits in the early/mid '90s: &quot;Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)&quot; (1991), &quot;100% Pure Love&quot; (1994) and &quot;Say... If You Feel Alright&quot; (1997).\n\nShe is also the singer in &quot;Destination Calabria&quot;, a 2007 hit release by Alex Gaudino, a mashup which uses vocals from her 2004 &quot;Destination Unknown&quot; and instrumental from Rune RK's 2003 &quot;Calabria&quot;.\n\nWaters lived in New Jersey, but later moved to Washington, D.C., to study computer science at Howard University. After graduation, she worked as a computer technician at the Washington, D.C., Parole Board[1]. She took her demo tape of &quot;Gypsy Woman&quot; to a Music Business Forum, and the only people to call her about it were a trio of club disc jockeys who formed the Basement Boys.\n\n&quot;Gypsy Woman&quot; became a worldwide hit, memorable for its la da dee la dee da refrain and its often sampled keyboard riff. The track reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100, and found even more success in Europe, reaching #2 on the UK Singles Chart. The track was also parodied in the memorable sketch &quot;My Songs Are Mindless&quot; (Performed by Kim Wayans) on the television series In Living Color in 1991. Wayans skewered the song's simple rhythm and melody by singing &quot;Hey look at that it's Fred and the Flintstones! That's a song now, I got a song now: Yabba Dabba Doo Yabba Dabba Da, Yabba Dabba Doo Yabba Dabba Da....&quot; The clip from the comedy show would sometimes show up mixed into Waters' own composition at Gay clubs with video screens. Scarcely a year after its release, a new version turned up on the Red Hot + Dance AIDS fundraiser disc (1992, distributed by Sony Music), gaining its remixer (Joey Negro) his first real American exposure.\n\nDespite some additional contributions by remixer Steve &quot;Silk&quot; Hurley, Waters' next releases were promoted only in the dance music markets, but she made an unexpected mainstream comeback in 1994 when &quot;100% Pure Love&quot; hit #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became one of the longest charting singles on the Hot 100 at 45 weeks (&quot;Gypsy Woman&quot; remained on the chart for an average 16 weeks).\n\nHer 1997, self-titled album included another Top 40 US hit, &quot;Say...If You Feel Alright,&quot; but mainstream success in the US has since eluded her. However, Waters remains successful on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play and the Hot Dance Airplay charts with recent hits like &quot;Come On Down&quot; and &quot;My Time,&quot; both of which peaked at #1, the latter making top 40 in the UK. &quot;Gypsy Woman&quot;'s keyboard-chord was recently sampled on rapper T.I.'s 2006 mega-hit &quot;Why You Wanna.&quot;\n\nIn 2007 Waters embarked on a world tour; performing sold out shows in Russia, Egypt, the United Kingdom, Germany, Mexico, and Dubai, among other locations. In 2007 her track &quot;Destination Calabria&quot; hit the Top 10 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn May 2008, Waters issued the single &quot;Dancefloor&quot;, giving Waters yet another Top 10 Dance hit. &quot;Never Enough&quot; hit #20 on the US Dance Charts in February 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d67a51dc7c6997c4a253c5e577b6e192b4ca0f3","amp;dn":"crystal+waters+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d67a51dc7c6997c4a253c5e577b6e192b4ca0f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,103,165,29,199,198,153,124,74,37,60,94,87,123,110,25,43,76,160,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
