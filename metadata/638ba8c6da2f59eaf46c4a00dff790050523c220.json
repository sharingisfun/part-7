Her operatically-trained, five-octave instrument was the very model of beauty and control. Consequently, her signature tune, Lovin You, is likely the breeziest bit of pop you may ever hear. In addition to her own songs, Riperton also makes light work of material as lovely and strong as Stevie Wonders Perfect Angel and Joni Mitchells Woman of Heart and Mind. The only misstep on this collection, in fact, is yet another unnecessary take of The Doors Light My Fire.\n\nAllmusic Review:\nUntil 1999s Free Soul (Capitol) and 2001s exhaustive but more excellent overall Petals (The Right Stuff) came along, Capitol Gold offered the best summation of this true originals horribly undervalued solo career. As with Free Soul, Capitol Gold leaves a significant gap by excluding the best moments from Minnie Ripertons debut (Come to My Garden), an album that was released on GTR. This issue would be rectified by The Right Stuff, a subsidiary of Capitol, for Petals. Still, Capitol Gold makes for a fine substitute introduction to Riperton; it includes all of her significant singles and a good survey of album tracks that didnt receive the notice they deserved when they were originally released.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:638ba8c6da2f59eaf46c4a00dff790050523c220","amp;dn":"Minnie+Riperton+-+The+Best+of+Minnie+Riperton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"638ba8c6da2f59eaf46c4a00dff790050523c220","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,139,168,198,218,47,89,234,244,108,74,0,223,247,144,5,5,35,194,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
