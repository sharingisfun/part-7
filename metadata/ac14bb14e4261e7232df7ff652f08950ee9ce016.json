A memorable work of noir fiction and a classic film is They Shoot Horses, DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t They? (1935), filmed in 1969 with Sydney Pollack as the director, which achieved its aim of illustrating the pain and hopelessness of the Great Depression, using a marathon dance contest as a metaphor, with the exhausting and pointless expenditure of energy for participants being analogous to the plight of the majority of Americans; No Pockets in a Shroud (1937) was filmed in France in 1975.\n\nNovels:\nI Should Have Stayed Home\nNo Pockets in a Shroud\nThey Shoot Horses, Don't They?\nKiss Tomorrow Goodbye\n\nShort Stories:\nBombs for the General\nFrost Rides Alone\nTrapped by Silver\nThe Mopper-Up\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac14bb14e4261e7232df7ff652f08950ee9ce016","amp;dn":"Horace+McCoy+Noir+Collection+%288+Novels+and+Short+Stories%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac14bb14e4261e7232df7ff652f08950ee9ce016","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,20,187,20,228,38,30,114,50,223,127,246,82,240,137,80,238,156,224,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
