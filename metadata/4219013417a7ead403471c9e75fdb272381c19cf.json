Spot has been kidnapped by the yellow trash monster, who is wanted for drash-dumping and spot-napping. Unfortunately, Blasternaut\\\\\\'s spaceship is out of fuel, so Blasternaut must recycle the trash into fuel before he goes and defeats the yellow trash monster. In four stages Blasternaut will gather trash, convert the trash to fuel, fly through a cave, and finally destroy the yellow trash monsters\\\\\\' spaceship, all while collecting as many bonus points as possible along the way in hopes of making a high score. Difficulty is scaleable, and should provide a challenge to kids from pre-school to middle schoolers. At the highest difficulty settings the game can even be fairly challenging for adults as well.\n\n    As stated above, I could not get the game to work in the 64-bit version of Windows 7. Most likely the game will not work under any 64-bit operating system; however, you should be able to run it under any 32-bit Windows system, even if it is Windows 7 or Vista. I was able to successfully run the game under Windows XP.\n\n    I will keep this on my seed list, so don\\\\\\'t give up if you don\\\\\\'t see any seeders; sooner or later I\\\\\\'ll be around to send you some data. :)\n\n    Be sure to view the \\\\\\'Read me first!!!\\\\\\' text file for instructions on setting up the game.
