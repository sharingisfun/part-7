The new tracks - featuring an amazing and idiosyncratic cast of collaborators including Paul McCartney, Grohl's former Nirvana and current Foo Fighters bandmates, Stevie Nicks, Rick Springfield, Trent Reznor, Joshua Homme of Queens of the Stone Age, Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick, Lee Ving of Fear, Corey Taylor of Slipknot, Brad Wilk and Tim Commerford of Rage Against The Machine and more - passionately exemplify SOUND CITY's celebration of the human element of musicianship and recording in an increasingly digital world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34c57412eedd82e9c45b5009c2c332246e6ddf53","amp;dn":"Various+Artists+-+Sound+City%3A+Reel+To+Reel+%5B2013%5D%5BV0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34c57412eedd82e9c45b5009c2c332246e6ddf53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,197,116,18,238,221,130,233,196,91,80,9,194,195,50,36,110,109,223,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
