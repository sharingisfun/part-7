Matsch), for numerous theatres and above all (on his own this time) for the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, where he completed, in a coolly photographic style, the work begun by Makart. At the age of thirty he moved into his own studio and turned to easel painting. At thirty-five he was one of the founders of the Vienna Secession; he withdrew eight years later, dismayed by the increasingly strong trend towards naturalism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:280f05eafe8096bbee2541ab432f2e795c2b4aa0","amp;dn":"Klimt.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"280f05eafe8096bbee2541ab432f2e795c2b4aa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,15,5,234,254,128,150,187,238,37,65,171,67,47,46,121,92,43,74,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
