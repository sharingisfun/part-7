The same\npoor printing occurs for Gladstone's issues on Ghost of the\nGrotto and No such Varmint.  I chose the Dynabrite version \nof No such Varmint for the CBDA as the best of three\nversions.\n\nSet 5 is now available!\n\n*************\n\nI am still putting together set 9-12.\n\nI found 20 HQ comics in Italian for Set 9.\nSo, if I can't find an english HQ comic for Set 9,\nthen I can always copy and paste the english script \ninto the italian comic.\n\nSet 10 will have the fewest recent HQ comics, since\nmost of the comics were only reprinted in soft cover\ngraphic albums.  I have the WDSC graphic \nalbums on hand, but I'm not willing to \nbend them all out of shape to scan.\nAny suggestions?\n\nSet 11: \n\na. Barks Bear book and updated scans\nb. Unexpurgated Barks\nc. Chronological DD by CB \nmkv videos (Done)\nd. Pluto saves the ship\nscanlation (Done)\ne. Coo Coo # 01 magazine reprint\n\nSet 12:\n\na. artwork\ni.

Abbeville CB trilogy:\n (Abbeville has cropped CB's work too much and \nhas made these comics incompatible for updating comics.)\nii.informal biography of Scrooge McDuck\niii. Authorized DD biograpy + CD of Barks interview\niv. maybe, US life and times\nv. Don Rosa related stories\n\n\n**********\n\nThe excellent free disney comics website is available if you just\nwant to read the un-cropped comics online.\nMuch thanks goes to that guy who has posted many more recent \nscans of wdc&amp;s stories.  It gives me a quite a few more comics\nto update though.\n\n\nThe CBDA collection will be complete, but if you can find better scans \nthan posted within this collection, then\nplease leave a message and post up your comic scans.\n\nI will update this request list as I go along.\nThanks for helping!\n\n\n*******************************************\nScan Request of more recent colored published issues:\n\n*******************************************\n\n(Gold Key comics are not quite as good as original Dell comic.)\n\nSet 8:\n\nWDCS 097 Pearls of wisdom\nWDCS 101 DD's Worst Nightmare\nWDCS 108 The great Duckburg frog jumping contest\n\n*****************\n\nRequest list updated and transferred to Set 5!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c2c58baf0a8b07fb73b683cb31522bc2d476285","amp;dn":"Carl+Barks+Digital+Archive+Set+8+of+12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c2c58baf0a8b07fb73b683cb31522bc2d476285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,44,88,186,240,168,176,127,183,59,104,60,179,21,34,188,45,71,98,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
