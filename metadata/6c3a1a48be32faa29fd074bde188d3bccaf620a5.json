She is a founding member and past president of Novelists, Inc., a national organization of published writers of popular fiction. She is also co-founder and past-president of PENNWRITERS, a statewide writer's organization in Pennsylvania. Victoria has served on the board of directors of Romance Writers of America (RWA) for four years, and was co-founder and the first President of New Jersey Romance Writers. Victoria lives in Pennsylvania with her family.\n\nVictoria Thompson's Gaslight mystery series starring midwife Sarah Brandt and cop Frank Malloy combines an interesting as well as historical look at life in New York City in the late 1990's, as the main characters solve, against all odds, difficult murder crimes. Sarah Brandt, the strong female character, is more modern than her Victorian times allow, but Thompson doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make her too anachronistic. She may be rebellious for her times but she is still far removed from our 21st century sensibilities. It is a strange time Ã¢â‚¬â€police corruption is the norm, in fact it is expected, as is police brutality, misogyny is rampant in all levels of society, poverty is everywhereÃ¢â‚¬â€ with medical and industrial advancements bumping up against the ingrained restraints and buttoned up collars of Victorian society. A woman that chooses to make her own way in the world instead of allowing her wealthy parents to take care of her is considered unnatural.\nDetective Sergeant Frank Malloy is a man of his times; it would be difficult for any modern reader to root for a hero that beats confessions out of his suspects and takes bribes just to close a case. But times are changing... and he is the one with the most changing to do. . .\n\nist of Books:\n\n01. Murder on Astor Place (1999)\n02. Murder at St. Mark's Place (2000)\n03.
