Alongside reviewing the current level of knowledge, they also put forward novel ideas to foster research and development in such expanding fields as nanobiotechnology and nanomedicine. As such, the book covers DNA-induced nanoparticle assembly, nanostructured substrates for circulating tumor cell\r\ncapturing, and organic nano field effect transistors, as well as advanced dynamic gels and self-healing electronic nanodevices.\r\n\r\nWith its interdisciplinary approach this book gives readers a complete picture of nanotechnology with soft matter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1e8ea2ac3de3c68d68b66d685060e6f574b49d7","amp;dn":"Soft+Matter+Nanotechnology+-+From+Structure+to+Function","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1e8ea2ac3de3c68d68b66d685060e6f574b49d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,232,234,42,195,222,60,104,214,139,102,214,133,6,14,111,87,75,73,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
