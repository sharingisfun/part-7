Not my own scan, harvested off other P2P. \n\nHas an ugly watermark on the cover and inside-front (because I used trial software to fix the page order in two-up reading mode), middling scan quality, and haphazard alignment. It is, however, what's available. A more polished PDF will doubtless surface eventually.\n\nMeanwhile, enjoy. In the grim darkness of the 41st millenium, there is only war- and swashbuckling pirate accountants!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faf68270409fd67800a882f78d62cf4b59b9b669","amp;dn":"Rogue+Trader+%282009%29+-+Core+Rulebook.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faf68270409fd67800a882f78d62cf4b59b9b669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,246,130,112,64,159,214,120,0,168,130,247,141,98,207,75,89,185,182,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
