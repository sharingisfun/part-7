Edits made with Audacity.\n\nThis an updated final FLAC version of my compilation. The Cardinal Jams (originally Discs 7-8) and some tracks from disc 6 have been removed and are now included in the &quot;Sing You A Song&quot; Jam &amp; Improv Collection (updated 6 CD final version coming soon). Although &quot;Petal In A Rainstorm&quot; was released by now, I found it to be too pretty to be taken out. I included &quot;Testy, Testy&quot; and &quot;21st Century Wars&quot;, since unlike the available demos the live versions have lyrics.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1 - 1994-1998\n\n01.
