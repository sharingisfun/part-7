However, St. Vincent's beguiling sounds helped Actor rise to number 90 on the Billboard Top 200 album charts, and its follow-up, Strange Mercy, confirmed her newfound stardom by debuting on Billboard at number 19 in the fall of 2011.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcd3012dfb1368b2f0c3d295935c39962ea1421a","amp;dn":"St.+Vincent+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcd3012dfb1368b2f0c3d295935c39962ea1421a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,211,1,45,251,19,104,178,240,195,210,149,147,92,57,150,46,161,66,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
