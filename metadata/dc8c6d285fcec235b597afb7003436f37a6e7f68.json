Jackson is starring as a maverick American cop in a UK police thriller. Andy uses lies and excuses to shake off a dull extra who wants to befriend him. The man&amp;#039;s insistence causes Andy to cave in and have dinner with him, but it ends with Andy telling women surrounding him that they are not a couple and ends up putting his face in his soup before leaving. Maggie is attracted to a young black actor. Despite some initial misunderstandings due to her over-sensitivity about race, she successfully asks him out on a date, but further misunderstandings end the date early. When she chats with Jackson on set the day after, she confuses him with Laurence Fishburne. Andy tries to save the ailing conversation and, when this fails, Andy is asked to leave the set, forfeiting the line he had earlier managed to get with Jackson","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc8c6d285fcec235b597afb7003436f37a6e7f68","amp;dn":"Extras+%28BBC%29+-+5+-+Ricky+Gervais+%26+Samuel+L.Jackson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc8c6d285fcec235b597afb7003436f37a6e7f68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,140,109,40,95,206,194,53,181,151,175,183,0,52,54,243,122,110,127,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
