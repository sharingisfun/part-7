In addition to summarizing the generally used plastic feedstocks and technologies, the book will also cover some of the more remarkable advances in plastics manufacturing in recent years, including ultrasonic and laser plastics welding to optical curing and enhanced biodegradable properties. The material has been presented in this book in such a way that it can be a prerequisite for university courses on polymer technology. It will also serve as a basis for advanced studies, not only for lectures and seminars at the graduate level, but also for engineers entering the field of plastics engineering research and applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:200b8494e3b8a326824139f48f877a8e25c5d800","amp;dn":"Basics+of+Polymers+-+Fabrication+and+Processing+Technology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"200b8494e3b8a326824139f48f877a8e25c5d800","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,11,132,148,227,184,163,38,130,65,57,244,143,135,122,142,37,197,216,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
