There are 35 tracks spread over two CDs and the only thing this set reveals is that Greenbaum was completely intoxicated with the early blues, warm climes, and possibly, quite possibly, Harry Nilsson. His lyrics are precious and, worst of all, cute, and his arrangements and melodies are disposable pop pablum at best. If anyone ever deserved one-hit wonder status it's Greenbaum; &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot; was a fluke, not because it was a hit, but because -- given the rest of the crap he's written -- it's not only a good song, but a great one.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c502436bd2b613a4e0a338a429a6e4a2fee25769","amp;dn":"Norman+Greenbaum+-+Sp+The+Sky%3A+The+Definitive+Anthology+%282003%29+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c502436bd2b613a4e0a338a429a6e4a2fee25769","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,2,67,107,210,182,19,164,224,163,56,164,41,166,228,162,254,226,87,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
