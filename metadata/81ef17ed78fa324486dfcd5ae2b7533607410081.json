Following the traditional format for koan collections, John Daido Loori Roshi, an American Zen master, has added his own commentary and accompanying verse for each of DogenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s koans. Zen students and scholars will find The True Dharma Eye to be a source of deep insight into the mind of one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest religious thinkers, as well as the practice of koan study itself.\n\nAuthor: John Daido Loori\n\nPublisher: Shambhala Publications Inc.\n\nYear released: 3 Oct 2008\n\nGenre: Non fiction\n\nFormat: epub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81ef17ed78fa324486dfcd5ae2b7533607410081","amp;dn":"Loori%2C+John+Daido.+The+True+Dharma+Eye%2C+Dogen%27s+Three+Hundred+Ko","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81ef17ed78fa324486dfcd5ae2b7533607410081","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,239,23,237,120,250,50,68,134,223,205,90,226,183,83,54,7,65,0,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
