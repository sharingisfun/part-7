Otherwise check Steam forums for updates  on  how  issues  like\n this can be fixed or wait for a patch that adresses it.\n\n\n Game information:\n =================\n\n Featuring a co-op campaign for 1 to 4  players,  Nazi  Zombie  Army  is  a\n horrifying new stand-alone expansion of  the  award-winning  Sniper  Elite\n series.\n In the dying flames of World War II, a  despairing  Hitler  unleashes  one\n final, unholy gamble - a legion of undead super soldiers that threatens to\n overwhelm the whole of Europe.\n You are Karl Fairburne - the sniper who shaped world history. You are  one\n of  the  last  living  souls  in  Germany.  You  must  team  up  or   die.\n American, German,  Russian  -  previous  military  allegiances  no  longer\n matter. Now it's just the living versus the dead.\n Only a Sniper Elite with nerves of steel and a steady aim stands a  chance\n against Hitler's Nazi Zombie Army!\n\n\n Features:\n =========\n * Battle through blood-drenched levels in a Berlin overrun by Hitler's\n   supernatural forces.\n * Adapt to harrowing new enemies - occult commanders, roof-jumping\n   snipers, undead suicide infantry and worse...\n * Test your sniping skills under extreme pressure, keep your cool, and\n   keep a boomstick handy - just in case.\n * For the first time in Sniper Elite history, battle your way through a\n   campaign built for up to four players.\n * Fight back-to-back with a German officer, a scientist and a Russian\n   soldier.\n * Work together or face annihilation - plan your positions, set your traps\n   and make your stand.\n * See every putrid lung burst, every rotten bone shatter with the return\n   of Sniper Elite's acclaimed X-Ray 'kill cam'.\n * Experience the genre-best sniping ballistics and precise controls that\n   made the series a best-seller.\n * Take into account gravity, wind, velocity, stability and more under the\n   pressure of the zombie onslaught. You don't want to miss.\n\n\n Installation Information:\n =========================\n\n * Burn or mount\n * Install\n * Play the game\n\n NOTE: As usual, block the game exe in your firewall.\n\n                                                             /TEAM FAiRLIGHT\n\n\n                    +-+  QUALITY, TRADITION  AND PRIDE +-+\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff5bf052afcb2eb6592dc7015762d050fe783588","amp;dn":"Sniper_Elite_Nazi_Zombie_Army-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff5bf052afcb2eb6592dc7015762d050fe783588","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,91,240,82,175,203,46,182,89,45,199,1,87,98,208,80,254,120,53,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
