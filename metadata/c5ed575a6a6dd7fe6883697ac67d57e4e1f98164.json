Whether it's a business card, a poster, or a book, your design will look better if you use a grid. Join designer Nigel French as he takes you through a brief history of gridsÃ¢â‚¬â€why you should use them and when you should break them. He'll show you how to establish margins and columns, set up a layout grid, and how to fit text to a baseline grid. Plus, learn how to break the grid for graphic effect and experiment with different types of grids like 5- or 7-column layouts and radial grids.\nTopics include:\n\n    Why grids matter\n    Determining your page size\n    Creating margins and defining your type area\n    Setting up a baseline grid\n    Understanding the power of InDesign's Gridify feature\n    Breaking your grid with images\n    Maximizing white space with a grid\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5ed575a6a6dd7fe6883697ac67d57e4e1f98164","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Designing+with+Grids+in+InDesign","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5ed575a6a6dd7fe6883697ac67d57e4e1f98164","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,237,87,90,106,109,215,254,104,131,105,122,198,125,87,228,225,249,129,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
