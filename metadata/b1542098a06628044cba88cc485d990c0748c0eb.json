It's like writing a cooking recipe: you write the recipe and the computer cooks it.\n\nTo write Haskell programs, you need a program called a Haskell compiler. A compiler is a program that takes code written in Haskell and translates it into machine code, a second, more primitive language which only computers can understand. Using the above analogy, the compiler is the oven that bakes your batter (code) into a cookie (executable file), and you can't get the recipe from the cookie afterward.\n\n\nBook Details :\n\nSize : 3.7 Mb\nTitle : Haskell Programming Language\nPages : 597\nFormat : pdf\n\n\n\nFollow us on facebook...\n\nhttp:// www. facebook .com/ torrentsharing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1542098a06628044cba88cc485d990c0748c0eb","amp;dn":"Haskell+Programming+Language%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+torrents+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1542098a06628044cba88cc485d990c0748c0eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,84,32,152,160,102,40,4,76,186,136,204,72,93,153,12,7,72,192,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
