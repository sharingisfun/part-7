The first settled line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Ian Stewart (piano), Mick Jagger (lead vocals, harmonica), Keith Richards (guitar), Bill Wyman (bass), and Charlie Watts (drums). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as occasional pianist until his death in 1985. Jones departed the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1975. Subsequently, Ronnie Wood has been on guitar in tandem with Richards. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones has been the main bassist. Other notable keyboardists for the band have included Nicky Hopkins, active from 1967 to 1982; Billy Preston through the mid 1970s (most prominent on Black and Blue); and Chuck Leavell, active since 1982. The band was first led by Jones, but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed de facto leadership.\n\nThe Rolling Stones were in the vanguard of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the US in 1964Ã¢â‚¬â€œ65. At first noted for their longish hair as much as their music, the band are identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. Critic Sean Egan states that within a year of the release of their 1964 debut album, they &quot;were being perceived by the youth of Britain and then the world as representatives of opposition to an old, cruel order Ã¢â‚¬â€ the antidote to a class-bound, authoritarian culture.&quot; They were instrumental in making blues a major part of rock and roll, and of changing the international focus of blues culture to the less sophisticated blues typified by Chess Records artists such as Muddy Waters, writer of &quot;Rollin' Stone&quot;, the song after which the band is named. After a short period of musical experimentation that culminated with the poorly received and largely psychedelic album Their Satanic Majesties Request (1967), the group returned to its bluesy roots with Beggars' Banquet (1968) which Ã¢â‚¬â€œ along with its follow-ups, Let It Bleed (1969), Sticky Fingers (1971) and Exile on Main St. (1972) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is generally considered to be the band's best work, and are considered the Rolling Stones' &quot;Golden Age&quot;. Musicologist Robert Palmer attributed the &quot;remarkable endurance&quot; of the Rolling Stones to being &quot;rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music&quot; while &quot;more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone&quot;.\n\nThe band continued to release commercially successful records through the 1970s and selling many albums with Some Girls (1978) and Tattoo You (1981) being their two most sold albums worldwide. In the 1980s, a feud between Jagger and Richards about the band's musical direction almost caused the band to split but they managed to patch their relationship and had a big comeback with Steel Wheels (1989) which was followed by a big stadium and arena tour. Since the 1990s, new recorded material from the group has been both increasingly less well-received and less frequent. Despite this, the Stones have continued to be a huge attraction on the live circuit with big stadium tours continuing through the 1990s and 2000s. By 2007, the band had made what were then four of the top five highest-grossing concert tours of all time (Voodoo Lounge Tour (1994Ã¢â‚¬â€œ95), Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997Ã¢â‚¬â€œ99), Licks Tour (2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œ03) and A Bigger Bang Tour (2005Ã¢â‚¬â€œ07)).\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them fourth on the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; list, and their estimated album sales are above 250 million. They have released twenty-nine studio albums, eighteen live albums and numerous compilations. Let It Bleed (1969) was their first of five consecutive number one studio and live albums in the UK. Sticky Fingers (1971) was the first of eight consecutive number one studio albums in the US. In 2008 the band ranked 10th on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists&quot; chart. In 2012, the band celebrated its 50th anniversary.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSome Girls is the 14th British and 16th American studio album by The Rolling Stones, released in 1978 on Rolling Stones Records, catalogue COC 39108. It peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200, and became the band's top selling album in the United States, certified by the RIAA as having six million copies sold as of 2000. It was a major critical success, becoming the only The Rolling Stones album in their complete discography to be nominated for a Grammy in the Album of the Year category the following year and with many reviewers calling it a classic return to form, and their best album since 1972's Exile on Main St.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Rolling Stones:\n\n\nMick Jagger: lead and backing vocals, electric guitar; piano on &quot;Faraway Eyes&quot;; bonus tracks: piano on &quot;Petrol Blues&quot;; electric piano on &quot;No Spare Parts&quot;; harmonica on &quot;When You're Gone&quot; and &quot;Keep Up Blues&quot;; handclaps on &quot;Tallahassee Lassie&quot;\n\nKeith Richards: electric and acoustic guitars, backing vocals; lead vocals on &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot;, bass guitar on &quot;Some Girls&quot; and &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot;; piano on &quot;Faraway Eyes&quot;; bonus tracks: lead vocals on &quot;We Had It All&quot;; piano on &quot;No Spare Parts&quot; and &quot;I Love You Too Much&quot;; electric piano on &quot;You Win Again&quot;\n\nRonnie Wood: electric, acoustic, pedal steel and slide guitar, backing vocals; bass guitar and bass drum on &quot;Shattered&quot;\n\nBill Wyman: bass guitar; synthesizer on &quot;Some Girls&quot;; bonus tracks: marimba on &quot;Don't Be a Stranger&quot;\n\nCharlie Watts: drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03d4c2976f5bafbff500eec2fb1c12fa3779153e","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones%2FSome+Girls+%5B2CD%27s%5D%5B1978%5D%5B2011%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03d4c2976f5bafbff500eec2fb1c12fa3779153e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,212,194,151,111,91,175,191,245,0,238,194,251,28,18,250,55,121,21,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
