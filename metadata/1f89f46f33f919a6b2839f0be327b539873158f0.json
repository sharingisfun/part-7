One of pianist Bill Evans' earlier influences was Lennie Tristano so on the date Evans' trio (with bassist Eddie Gomez and drummer Eliot Zigmund) was teamed with Tristano's two top &quot;students&quot;: altoist Lee Konitz and tenor saxophonist Warne Marsh. The quintet performs four standards (all of which fit easily into Evans' repertoire) plus &quot;Pensativa&quot; and Steve Swallow's &quot;Eiderdown.&quot; Konitz and Marsh always worked very well together and their cool-toned improvising makes this outing by Bill Evans something special. The CD reissue adds three alternate takes to the original program. Recommended. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Eiderdown\n02 - Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\n03 - Pensativa\n04 - Speak Low\n05 - When I Fall in Love\n06 - Night and Day\n07 - Eiderdown (take 9)\n08 - Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye (take 7)\n09 - Night and Day (take 9)\n\nEnjoy and share!
