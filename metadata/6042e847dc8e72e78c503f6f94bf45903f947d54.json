It's both a blessing and a curse, because the millions of fans of the original and its two expansion packs will no doubt be happy to receive more of the same park-building fun but crestfallen over how few changes have been made by developer Chris Sawyer. Though newcomers will likely find the sequel enjoyable for the simple, engaging fun that it shares with the original game, if you were already a fan of RollerCoaster Tycoon, you'll probably have a hard time believing that you waited so long for what the sequel has to offer: the same old graphics, the same old rides, and the same old objectives.
