It's portion of the Mustard Seed Garden Manual are nice, although a mere fraction of the illustrations in the original. It introduces a bit of Taoist philosophy and it's implications in painting. Practicing the drawings from the manual really helps to understand the formation of expressive lines in their simplest forms. Highly recommended for artists and those studying Chinese philosophy as well. The basic idea here is to not just render a physical likeness of the subject, but to portray it's character in as simple a fashion as possible so as to challenge the viewers imagination to engage in the creation of the painting. And also to get to the heart of the subject and 'portray it's soul'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8463c1e72da7f1d3dd3c1b8ac0d471d0839c1685","amp;dn":"The+Way+of+Chinese+Painting+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8463c1e72da7f1d3dd3c1b8ac0d471d0839c1685","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,99,193,231,45,167,241,211,221,60,27,138,192,212,113,208,131,156,22,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
