In 1963 he moved to Athens, terminating his law studies in favour of his career in music. He met great success since his early days as a musician and soon became very popular, both in Greece and abroad.\n\nSavvopoulos has been noted for being politically active throughout his career in music. In 1967, Savvopoulos was imprisoned for his political convictions by the Greek military junta.\n\nMost of his songs are written by himself (both lyrics and music). He is still singing but no longer composing (since his last CD &quot;The Millennium&quot;).
