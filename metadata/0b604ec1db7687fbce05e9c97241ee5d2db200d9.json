In addition, the new edition expands and updates the discussion of theoretical concepts and ideas which underpin contemporary artistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ video.\n\nTracking the changing forms of video art in relation to the revolution in electronic and digital imaging that has taken place during the last 50 years, A History of Video Art orients video art in the wider art historical context, with particular reference to the shift from the structuralism of the late 1960s and early 1970s to the post-modernist concerns of the 1980s and early 1990s. The new edition also explores the implications of the internationalisation of artistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ video in the period leading up to the new millennium and its concerns and preoccupations including post-colonialism, the post-medium condition and the impact and influence of the internet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b604ec1db7687fbce05e9c97241ee5d2db200d9","amp;dn":"A+History+of+Video+Art+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b604ec1db7687fbce05e9c97241ee5d2db200d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,96,78,193,219,118,135,251,206,5,233,201,114,65,238,93,45,178,0,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
