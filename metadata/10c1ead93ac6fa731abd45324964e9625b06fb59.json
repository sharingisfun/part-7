Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents (major sections, not every poem) in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\nCzeslaw Milosz (1911-2004) was a Polish poet who spent much of his life in the USA. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1980. In addition to poetry he wrote novels and essays on many topics. His book The Captive Mind (available here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8060555 ) remains well-known as a dissection of the Communist mind-set he experienced in Poland.\n\nMilosz is my favorite poet, though I've read only the poetry from late in his life; the early stuff is much harder to understand. His late poetry is deceptively simple and direct. But with a bit of mulling it's transcendent beauty becomes visible.\n\nThis poem from 1985 was the first Milosz poem I read, and remains one I love:\n\n\nA CONFESSION\n\nMy Lord, I loved strawberry jam\nAnd the dark sweetness of a woman's body.\nAlso well-chilled vodka, herring in olive oil,\nScents, of cinnamon, of cloves.\nSo what kind of prophet am I? Why should the spirit\nHave visited such a man? Many others\nWere justly called, and trustworthy.\nWho would have trusted me? For they saw\nHow I empty glasses, throw myself on food,\nAnd glance greedily at the waitress's neck.\nFlawed and aware of it. Desiring greatness,\nAble to recognize greatness wherever it is,\nAnd yet not quite, only in part, clairvoyant,\nI knew what was left for smaller men like me:\nA feast of brief hopes, a rally of the proud,\nA tournament of hunchbacks, literature.\n\n\nIf you can see why this is so wonderful, you might like this book.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10c1ead93ac6fa731abd45324964e9625b06fb59","amp;dn":"Czeslaw+MIlosz+-+Collected+Poems+%28Nobel+Prize+winner%29%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10c1ead93ac6fa731abd45324964e9625b06fb59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,193,234,217,58,198,250,115,26,189,69,50,73,100,233,98,91,6,251,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
