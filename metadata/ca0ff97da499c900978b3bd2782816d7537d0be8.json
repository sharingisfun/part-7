Unfortunately Garth has not released his single to iTunes, Amazon or any other online service for digital download, so what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve included is an Internet rip (which still isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t too bad but far from broadcast quality.  Leave it to Garth).  Updated versions of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Drunk On A PlaneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (clean edit) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leave The Night OnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (much different from the iTunes download) are also included.\n\nSo here are the Top 30 U.S. Country Singles as ranked by Mediabase for the week of Sept 9, 2014 in Stereo mp3 CBR (constant bit rate).
