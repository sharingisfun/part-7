During its heyday, the band consisted of Roberts, Ellen Reid (co-vocals, keyboards), Brad's brother Dan Roberts (bass guitar), Benjamin Darvill (harmonica, mandolin), and Mitch Dorge (drums, percussion). Today, only Brad Roberts and Ellen Reid have appeared on every album with the other members being busy pursuing their own projects. However, the full band (minus Ben Darvill) reunited for a show in October 2010.[1]. Brad Roberts, Ellen Reid and Stuart Cameron have continued to tour throughout 2010/2011.\n\nIn many ways, the origin of the Crash Test Dummies is tied to the history of two Winnipeg nightspots, the Spectrum Cabaret and the Blue Note Cafe, owned by Curtis Riddell.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Riddell joined with Brad Roberts to form the decidedly less-than-serious bar band Bad Brad Roberts and the St. James Rhythm Pigs. Over time, the band evolved into the Crash Test Dummies, a name suggested by a friend of the band who was in medical school. The diagnostic mannequin, known colloquially as a crash test dummy, was known to the public already by this time. Ellen Reid and Benjamin Darvill became permanent additions. George West, the original bass player, quit and was replaced by Dan Roberts, Brad's brother. Riddell was replaced by Vince Lambert, who was fired and replaced by Mitch Dorge just before the release of The Ghosts that Haunt Me.\n\nAfter signing with BMG Records, the band signed with manager Jeff Rogers (Swell).[2]\n\nThe band first began to achieve commercial success in Canada with the release of The Ghosts that Haunt Me in 1991. The album eventually reached sales of 400,000 in Canada, largely due to the overwhelming popularity of the hit single &quot;Superman's Song&quot;, which earned the band the 1991 Juno Award for Group of the Year.\n\nThe band did not receive much international recognition until the 1993 release of their second album, God Shuffled His Feet. Particularly instrumental in increasing the band's exposure in the American market was the appearance of a new type of radio format, adult album-oriented alternative rock (AAA). These stations put the first single &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; in high rotation and the song peaked at #4 in the US Hot 100. &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; did even better in the United Kingdom, where it was a #2 hit, and Australia where it peaked at #1.\n\nIn their native Canada, &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; was a comparative disappointment on the charts, only peaking at #14. Two other songs from the album went top 10 in Canada: &quot;Swimming In Your Ocean&quot; and &quot;Afternoons &amp; Coffeespoons&quot;. This latter song was also a top 40 hit in Australia and the United Kingdom and hit the lower portion of the US Hot 100. The result was that by mid-1994 the album had passed the platinum sales mark (one million) in the United States and had also earned the band three Grammy nominations and three more Juno nominations. To date, God Shuffled His Feet has sold more than five and a half million copies worldwide.\n\nIn January 1995, the band released &quot;The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead&quot; (a cover of XTC's 1992 track) as a single and on the soundtrack of the Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels comedy Dumb and Dumber. The single, credited to The Crash Test Dummies and Ellen Reid, charted at No. 30 in the UK singles chart and was a #4 hit in Canada.\n\nIn 1996, the Dummies' third album, A Worm's Life, was released to mixed critical and moderate commercial success. The guitar-heavy singles were warmly received in some markets (lead single &quot;He Liked To Feel It&quot; hit #2 in Canada), but internationally nothing matched the runaway success of either &quot;Superman's Song&quot; or &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot;. Still, the album went platinum in Canada in less than one month.\n\nGive Yourself A Hand, the Dummies' fourth album, was released March 23, 1999. The album showcased a new sound for the Dummies, as it featured Ellen Reid singing lead vocals on three tracks, and Brad Roberts singing in a falsetto on several others. The whole sound of the album was much more electronic than the previous recordings. Once again, the lead single (&quot;Keep A Lid On Things&quot;) was a top 10 hit in Canada.\n\nDuring a hiatus between albums, Benjamin Darvill became the first Dummy to release solo material. Under the name Son Of Dave, Darvill first brought out the album B. Darvill's Wild West Show, followed with 01, both released on Benjamin's own label, Husky Records.[2]\n\nThe less-than-stellar commercial success of both A Worm's Life and Give Yourself a Hand resulted in the band feeling much more restricted by their label BMG, especially after the label rejected 35 songs during the production of Give Yourself a Hand. As a result, the band and the label parted ways, and Brad Roberts formed his own independent label &quot;Cha-Ching Records&quot; (later renamed to &quot;Deep Fried Records&quot;).[3]\n\nFree from major-label restrictions, the Dummies surprised their fans in 2001 by putting their solo projects on hold for a fifth studio album and tour. After suffering a near-fatal car accident in the fall of 2000, Brad found himself recuperating in the town of Argyle, Nova Scotia. It was there that he met some local &quot;lobster fishermen&quot; who happened to be quite musically inclined - Kent Greene, Dave Morton, and Danny MacKenzie. Together, they recorded the bulk of I Don't Care That You Don't Mind, which was to have been Brad's first solo album. Later on, Ellen was brought in to record backing vocals for a few tunes, and Dan agreed to tour with Brad. When Ellen and Mitch agreed to tour as well, the Crash Test Dummies name was put on the record. This album saw the Dummies returning to their acoustic roots. Brad compared this album to the Dummies' first, The Ghosts That Haunt Me, though he calls it more atmospheric and polished.\n\nNear the end of 2001, some new Dummies solo albums were released. First, Ellen Reid launched her debut solo effort, Cinderellen. Soon after, Brad Roberts' long-awaited double-live CD and rockumentary entitled Crash Test Dude were made available through MapleMusic. 2002 opened with the surprise of Mitch Dorge's debut album, As Trees Walking. On the CD, Mitch played almost all of the instruments, took some of the photos for the liner notes, and won a Prairie Music Award for Best Instrumental Recording.\n\nBrad, Dan, and Ellen returned as Crash Test Dummies at the end of 2002 with Jingle All the Way, a long-rumoured Christmas album.\n\nIn 2003, Puss 'n' Boots was released. Much like I Don't Care, the album began life as a Brad Roberts solo project. Co-written by Stuart Cameron, 13 songs were selected from a pool of 30. Ellen sang backing vocals and Dan played bass, though much of the music - funky grooves that would not have seemed out of place on Give Yourself A Hand - was performed by other musicians.\n\nSongs of the Unforgiven, the eighth studio album under the Crash Test Dummies name, was recorded not long after Puss 'n' Boots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ghosts That Haunt Me 1991\n\n\nThe Ghosts That Haunt Me is the 1991 debut album by Crash Test Dummies. It featured their hit &quot;Superman's Song&quot;.\n\nThe artwork featured on the cover, and throughout the liner notes, is by 19th-century illustrator Gustav DorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and is from 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The same painting would later be used for black metal band Judas Iscariot's final full length, &quot;To Embrace the Corpses Bleeding&quot;. Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave it 3Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ out of 5 stars and called it &quot;a fine debut album by the ever-smug, collegiate, folk-pop humorists.&quot;\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Winter Song&quot;-4:01\n2.\t&quot;Comin' Back Soon (The Bereft Man's Song)&quot;-4:27\n3.\t&quot;Superman's Song&quot;-4:31\n4.\t&quot;The Country Life&quot;-4:02\n5.\t&quot;Here on Earth (I'll Have My Cake)&quot;-3:03\n6.\t&quot;The Ghosts That Haunt Me&quot;-3:45\n7.\t&quot;Thick-Necked Man&quot; (Benjamin Darvill)-3:19\n8.\t&quot;Androgynous&quot; (Paul Westerberg)-2:36\n9.\t&quot;The Voyage&quot;-3:13\n10.\t&quot;At My Funeral&quot;-4:02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod Shuffled His Feet 1993\n\n\nGod Shuffled His Feet is the second album by the Crash Test Dummies, released in 1993. It features their most popular single, &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot;. The cover art superimposes the band members' faces over the figures of Titian's painting Bacchus and Ariadne. It was their most successful album commercially, charting at #9 in the U.S. charts, as well as #2 in the UK charts.\n\n\nThe album was the band's biggest mainstream hit. Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who gave it 4Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ out of 5 stars, attributes the album's success to &quot;Jerry Harrison's remarkably clear and focused production&quot; and that &quot;apart from the relatively concise pop smarts of the singles &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; and &quot;Afternoons and Coffeespoons,&quot; God Shuffled His Feet isn't all that different from the band's first album.\n\n\nGod Shuffled His Feet was a number-one album in Austria and New Zealand, and also reached the top five in the national albums charts of numerous countries such as Australia, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. In addition, the album reached number six in the Netherlands national albums chart,[2] and number nine in the United States Billboard 200 albums chart.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;God Shuffled His Feet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:10\n2.\t&quot;Afternoons &amp; Coffeespoons&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n3.\t&quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n4.\t&quot;In the Days of the Caveman&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n5.\t&quot;Swimming in Your Ocean&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n6.\t&quot;Here I Stand Before Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n7.\t&quot;I Think I'll Disappear Now&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:52\n8.\t&quot;How Does a Duck Know?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n9.\t&quot;When I Go Out with Artists&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n10.\t&quot;The Psychic&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n11.\t&quot;Two Knights and Maidens&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n12.\t&quot;Untitled&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:43\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Worm's Life 1996\n\n\nA Worm's Life is the third album by Crash Test Dummies, released in 1996. It came after their successful album, God Shuffled His Feet.\n\nAfter the band finished touring their hit album God Shuffled His Feet, frontman Brad Roberts spent considerable time traveling abroad, relocating to London, England at the time to escape the pressures of fame and celebrity where, because they didn't get MTV Europe, no one recognized him there &quot;except German and Italian tourists.&quot; [1] During his travels, Roberts began penning new material. Though he briefly visited New York City, most of the material he had written was outside North America, including one notable stay in Prague, Czech Republic [2]. Finally, after having compiled much written material, Roberts reconvened with the rest of the band at Compass Point Studios in The Bahamas in the winter of 1995 to begin recording the follow-up to God Shuffled His Feet. As a departure from the recording sessions of their first two records, the band decided to self-produce A Worm's Life. Pursuing a more guitar-heavy sound, the band drafted acclaimed music producer and recording engineer Terry Manning (known notably for his work with ZZ Top) to engineer the record. The band's producer, Jeff Rogers, noted: &quot;Terry has got a guitar collection to rival Randy Bachman's. And Brad got to play every one of them on the record.&quot; Roberts had claimed on record that A Worm's Life &quot;does go a little further than the other ones in terms of odd melodies, wacky key signatures, and chord changes.&quot; while continuing to adopt a lyrical approach that looks &quot;at simple things in unusual ways rather than the other way around.&quot;\n\nThe album was originally planned for release on August 28, 1996. However, the release date would later be moved back to October 2, 1996, with BMG Canada citing the need for &quot;more set-up time&quot;. Originally &quot;Overachievers&quot; was planned as the album's lead single (then titled &quot;The Over-Achievers&quot;), with the band's producer Jeff Rogers even noting at the time that the band had contacted three different directors for music video concepts to complement that track's release. However, &quot;He Liked to Feel It&quot; would later replace &quot;Overachievers&quot; as the lead single as the album's release date drew closer. &quot;He Liked to Feel It&quot; proved to be a hit in the band's native Canada, becoming their highest-peaking career single at #2 on the Canadian singles chart. Despite the single's success domestically, &quot;He Liked to Feel It&quot; made minimal chart impact abroad, perhaps due to controversy surrounding the track's music video hindering its promotional efforts. A second single, &quot;My Own Sunrise&quot;, would follow in January 1997, becoming a minor hit for the band, with &quot;My Enemies&quot; following as the album's third and final single later that year, also making limited impact.\n\nA Worm's Life enjoyed strong initial sales in Canada; achieving a platinum certification less than one month after its release date. However, the album sold disappointingly elsewhere, and would have a considerably shorter chart life compared to its predecessor God Shuffled His Feet in Canada.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Overachievers&quot;-3:44\n2.\t&quot;He Liked to Feel It&quot;-3:55\n3.\t&quot;A Worm's Life&quot;-2:56\n4.\t&quot;Our Driver Gestures&quot;-3:36\n5.\t&quot;My Enemies&quot;-3:14\n6.\t&quot;There Are Many Dangers&quot;-3:44\n7.\t&quot;I'm Outlived by That Thing?&quot;-3:15\n8.\t&quot;All of This Ugly&quot;-3:19\n9.\t&quot;An Old Scab&quot;-3:50\n10.\t&quot;My Own Sunrise&quot;-3:35\n11.\t&quot;I'm a Dog&quot;-3:47\n12.\t&quot;Swatting Flies&quot;-2:51\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive Yourself A Hand 1999\n\n\nGive Yourself a Hand is the fourth album by the Crash Test Dummies, released in 1999, and their final album for BMG. The album spawned a quirky hit &quot;Keep a Lid on Things&quot;. The Times review of the album described it as &quot;the best music of their career...an album of rare wit and vitality.&quot;\n\nFor their third album A Worm's Life, Crash Test Dummies were given a lot of creative freedom, thanks to the success of God Shuffled His Feet. However, the album was considered a disappointment and, the band's label, BMG pressured the band into immediately writing a follow-up. During the initial song-writing process, the band wrote and recorded 35 demos, all of which were rejected by BMG.[1] The demos from these sessions would be shelved until 2011, when a selection of them were released on the compilation album Demo-litions. In 1998, the band would then proceed to write and record the album that became Give Yourself a Hand. At the time, Brad Roberts had moved to Harlem and was greatly inspired by the urban music he heard in the area. As a result, he began the writing an album that was full of soul and hip-hop beats, including Roberts singing in Falsetto for the first time. The sound of the album can also to attributed to the contributions from co-writer/producer Greg Wells.[2] The band's keyboardist Ellen Reid is featured singing lead vocals on several tracks, including the album's second single &quot;Get You in the Morning&quot;.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Keep a Lid on Things&quot;-2:45\n2.\t&quot;A Cigarette Is All You Get&quot;-2:27\n3.\t&quot;Just Chillin'&quot;-3:32\n4.\t&quot;I Want to Par-tay!&quot;-2:29\n5.\t&quot;Give Yourself a Hand&quot;-3:00\n6.\t&quot;Get You in the Morning&quot;-2:57\n7.\t&quot;Pissed With Me&quot;-3:09\n8.\t&quot;Just Shoot Me, Baby&quot;-3:34\n9.\t&quot;A Little Something&quot; (Ellen Reid, Brad Roberts, Greg Wells)-4:36\n10.\t&quot;I Love Your Goo&quot; (Brad Roberts)-3:31\n11.\t&quot;Aching to Sneeze&quot; (Brad Roberts)-3:23\n12.\t&quot;Playing Dead&quot;-3:15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Don't Care That You Don't Mind 2001\n\n\nI Don't Care That You Don't Mind is the fifth studio album by Crash Test Dummies. The album began as a solo album for Brad Roberts, while he was recuperating in the town of Argyle, Nova Scotia after suffering a near-fatal car accident in the fall of 2000. Crash Test Dummies' name was put on the album after the band (minus Benjamin Darvill) agreed to tour the album.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;I Don't Care That You Don't Mind&quot;\n2.\t&quot;On And on&quot;\n3.\t&quot;The Day We Never Met&quot;\n4.\t&quot;Let It Feel Like Something Else&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Little Secret&quot;\n6.\t&quot;Sittin' on a Tree Stump&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Buzzin' Flies&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Yer Devil Ways&quot;\n9.\t&quot;Hangin' Tree&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Every Morning&quot;\n11.\t&quot;Never Comin' Back&quot;\n12.\t&quot;Put Me in a Corner of Your Mind&quot;\n13.\t&quot;Shoot 'Em Up, Shoot 'Em Down&quot;\n14.\t&quot;I Never Fall Asleep at Night&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJingle All The Way 2002\n\n\nJingle All the Way is a 2002 Christmas album by Crash Test Dummies.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;White Christmas&quot;\n2.\t&quot;O Little Town of Bethlehem&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Jingle Bells&quot;\n4.\t&quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot;\n5.\t&quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot;\n6.\t&quot;We Three Kings&quot;\n7.\t&quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot;\n8.\t&quot;The First Noel&quot;\n9.\t&quot;Silent Night&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;\n11.\t&quot;The Huron Carol&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuss 'n' Boots 2003\n\n\nPuss 'N' Boots is the sixth studio album by Crash Test Dummies, released in 2003. The album began life as a Brad Roberts solo project. While the lyrics were written by Brad Roberts, most of the music was written by Stuart Cameron. Perhaps not coincidentally, this album is, musically-speaking, more conventional, less original. Ellen sang backing vocals and Dan played bass, though much of the music was performed by other musicians.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;It's a Shame&quot;\n2.\t&quot;Everything Is Better with Me&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Triple Master Blaster&quot;\n4.\t&quot;I'm the Man (That You Are Not)&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Stupid Same&quot;\n6.\t&quot;I'll See What I Can Do&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Your Gun Won't Fire&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Flying Feeling&quot;\n9.\t&quot;If Ya Wanna Know&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Bye Bye Baby, Goodbye&quot;\n11.\t&quot;I Never Try That Hard&quot;\n12.\t&quot;Never Bother Looking Back&quot;\n13.\t&quot;It'll Never Leave You Alone&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSongs Of The Unforgiven 2004\n\n\nSongs of the Unforgiven is the seventh album recorded by the Crash Test Dummies, released in 2004. Almost immediately after recording &quot;Puss 'n' Boots&quot;, Brad Roberts, Ellen Reid and Dan Roberts proceeded to prepare recording the follow-up, with Roberts acknowledging he went &quot;through this phase where I was extremely prolific and I wrote like three records worth of material in a space of months.&quot; The band pursued a decisively raw, acoustic, stripped-down sound for &quot;Songs of the Unforgiven&quot;, and turned to the Internet in search of a recording studio that featured a pipe organ. By Googling &quot;recording studios&quot; plus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpipe organÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the first result revealed Sacred Heart Studios in Duluth, Minnesota: a church originally constructed in 1894 that was later abandoned and eventually restored and turned into a venue for concerts. Having discovered Sacred Heart Recording Studio included a 1493-pipe, Felgemaker pipe-organ, the band drove to Duluth and recorded the album the following January.\n\nThe album is decidedly apocalyptic thematically, featuring lyrics replete with Biblical references and imagery. Other unconventional instruments appear on the record, including the harp and kettle drums.\n\nSuzzy Roche (of female vocal group &quot;The Roches&quot; fame) provides backing vocals on the album's three sonnets.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Prelude&quot;\n2.\t&quot;Sonnet 1 (And When the Sun Goes Down)&quot;\n3.\t&quot;And So Will Always Be&quot;\n4.\t&quot;The Unforgiven Ones&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Interlude 1&quot;\n6.\t&quot;Come Down to the Sinkhole&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Is the Spell Really Broken?&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Everlasting Peace&quot;\n9.\t&quot;Sonnet 2 (And Back in Ages Past)&quot;\n10.\t&quot;The Beginning of the End&quot;\n11.\t&quot;Interlude 2&quot;\n12.\t&quot;You've Had Your Run&quot;\n13.\t&quot;There Is No Final Winner&quot;\n14.\t&quot;You've Done It Once Again&quot;\n15.\t&quot;Sonnet 3 (The Cold Is Here)&quot;\n16.\t&quot;The Wicked and the Evil&quot;\n17.\t&quot;Postlude&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOooh La La! 2010\n\n\nOooh La La! is the eighth album by the Crash Test Dummies, released 11 May 2010 on Deep Fried Records, distributed by MRI Records.[1] The songs on the album are based around the Optigan and Omnichord toy instruments. The seeds for Oooh La La! were first planted when Brad Roberts and producer Stewart Lerman (Antony &amp; the Johnsons, The Roches) became infatuated with vintage analog musical toys, particularly one manufactured by the Mattel company called the Optigan (an acronym for &quot;optical organ&quot;). Using celluloid discs, the Optigan projects the sounds of other instruments with different sets of keys triggering chords and individual notes. The discs, with names like &quot;Nashville,&quot; &quot;Swing It!&quot; and &quot;Guitar Boogie,&quot; rotate to produce different arrays of sounds. The process is eerily similar to the digital sampling that is so common today, but the antiquated analog system produces quite a different effect. &quot;Because we wrote using these discs, we were inspired to do things that we wouldn't have done,&quot; Roberts points out. &quot;I don't write big band style, but all of a sudden I had this big band [on disc], so I'm writing in a genre that I normally wouldn't be writing in. I can't say enough about how great it is to write on these toys.&quot;\n\nBrad Roberts originally stated that he planned to release the album as a digital-only release, since he couldn't afford the CD distribution costs (and he believed that CDs would be out of date by 2015).[3] However, plans were later changed and Roberts signed a distribution deal with MRI Records, which distributed the album via Sony's RED Distribution division.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Songbird&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n2.\t&quot;You Said You'd Meet Me (In California)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n3.\t&quot;And It's Beautiful&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n4.\t&quot;Paralyzed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n5.\t&quot;The In-Between Place&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:50\n6.\t&quot;Not Today Baby&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n7.\t&quot;Heart Of Stone'&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:52\n8.\t&quot;Lake Bras d'Or&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:25\n9.\t&quot;What I'm Famous for&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:57\n10.\t&quot;Now You See Her&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n11.\t&quot;Put a Face&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Of 2007\n\n\nThe Best of Crash Test Dummies is a 2007 compilation album by the Crash Test Dummies.
