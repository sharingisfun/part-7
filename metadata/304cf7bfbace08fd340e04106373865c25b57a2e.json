On &quot;Tea for Two,&quot; Rich's drumming brings out the charming show-off in Powell, and on &quot;Hallelujah,&quot; Powell plays with a hysterical clarity. &quot;Oblivion&quot; and &quot;Hallucinations&quot; are the most masterful of the eight solo cuts. \r\n\r\nHere Powell swings effortlessly and seems to be speaking his own, true language. The elegance of another era pervades the Gershwin-esque &quot;Parisian Thoroughfare&quot; and &quot;Dusk in Sandi.&quot; And one can imagine a young Bill Evans listening to &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot; and taking note of the rich, logical voicings coupled with a wonderful singing tone.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Tea for Two (take 5)\r\n02 - Tea for Two (take 6)\r\n03 - Tea for Two (take 10)\r\n04 - Hallelujah\r\n05 - Parisian Thoroughfare\r\n06 - Oblivion\r\n07 - Dusk in Sandi\r\n08 - Hallucinations\r\n09 - The Fruit\r\n10 - A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square\r\n11 - Just One of Those Things\r\n12 - The Last Time I Saw Paris\r\n\r\n*1988 Verve / PolyGram | 827 901-2\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nJuly 1, 1950, New York, tracks 1â€“4.\r\nBud Powell â€“ piano\r\nRay Brown â€“ bass\r\nBuddy Rich â€“ drums\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 1951, New York, tracks 5â€“12.\r\nBud Powell â€“ piano (solo)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:304cf7bfbace08fd340e04106373865c25b57a2e","amp;dn":"Bud+Powell+-+The+Genius+of+Bud+Powell+%281951%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"304cf7bfbace08fd340e04106373865c25b57a2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,76,247,191,186,206,8,253,52,14,4,16,99,115,134,92,37,181,122,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
