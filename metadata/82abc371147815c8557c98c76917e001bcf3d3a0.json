UK version, see more below! \n \n \nI downloaded a similar torrent from piratebay a while ago, hoping to play this wonderful game once more. Unfortunately, that torrent failed me. I wouldn't say that it was a, so called, &quot;bad&quot; torrent but it just didn't want to work on my computer with it's settings. With great luck at my hand I came over a original copy of the game at my girlfriend's. Her brother had it stashed (YEAAAAH!!!). Since I've seen many out there who really want to play this game so bad I just couldn't keep this treasure for myself. \n \nThis good old game is a blast but let's face it, it's also buggy as hell! And it isn't playable if you don't patch it (for Vista and XP users that is). This torrent is the UK version of the game and since the UK 1.09 patch is hard to find I have posted a link to the patch, there are some other fixes for bugs on that page but I haven't needed them and therefore not tried them. You may find many broken links to silver related topics over the net but this one still works (24/3 -09): http://hampe.1go.dk/mirror/silver/  \n \nNoob Instructions: \nFinish the download (!?)  \nMount the ISO-files with deamon tools light (or any other virtual drive-/image mounter-program for that matter). \nInstall the game. \nPaste the downloaded patch into the installation folder on your hard drive. \nKeep the corresponding cd mounted while you play or find a crack at (maybe) http://www.gamecopyworld.com/\nYou're done! Play!\n \nIf you need any help just email me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e4908b8588819090809d8f8596818aa48c8b9089858d88ca878b89ca&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; I will also answer questions here. It's a human right to be able to bring this fucking game to life on ones machine. \n \nSome other useful links: \nIf you find it hard there's a walkthrough: http://www.geocities.com/silverhints/walkthrough/main.htm \nYou may want a savegame or two, the &quot;bell scene&quot; for instance (you veterans know what I'm talking about!) but it isn't really necessary, it can be done, believe me! Savegames: http://www.cheats.ru/english/pc/s/silver/silversavegamecollection.zip \n \nLast but not least: I promise that there are no viruses in this download. Enjoy but seed like a mother or I will haunt you down in vengeance :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82abc371147815c8557c98c76917e001bcf3d3a0","amp;dn":"Silver+%281999%29+-+NodScene","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82abc371147815c8557c98c76917e001bcf3d3a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,171,195,113,20,120,21,200,85,124,152,199,105,23,224,1,188,243,211,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
