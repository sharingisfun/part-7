Think of it as a kind of Buena Vista Social Club \nfor the great 60s architects of Jamaican music. It is also a beautiful portrait of Jamaica.\nIn 1962, Jamaica gained its independence from Great Britain. There was celebration, \noptimism, economic growth and opportunity. Recording studios popped up all over \nKingston and a generation of great singers and players emerged playing the tuneful, \nmellow music that became known as rocksteady - tunes like The Tide Is High, \nRivers of Babylon and You Don't Love Me Anymore, No No No, which were so \nsuccessfully celebrated by UB40 on their Labour of Love albums. By 1968, \nJamaica's economic bubble had burst and social unrest took to the streets. \nAs poverty, violence and political upheaval spread, rocksteady became politicised, \nupped its tempo and began to evolve into the music they call reggae.\n\nRipping &amp; Transfer &amp; Dvd Creation, \nDvd Title Music, Dvd Information , Screenshot's, \nAnd Distribution By Sean A.k.a Soul Rebel\n\nIssued Too :www.marleyandtoshtorrents.net\nDate Off Issue:19th February 2011\n\nMD5 Included.\n\nDo Not Remove These Notes\nKeep It Lossless \nKeep A Seed\nShare It Freely\nDo Not Use For Tradeing\nThis Is Issued As Free\nAs Your Getting Now.\nFree !\n\nThat Is All I ask Of You !!\nThank You !!\nAnd\nEnjoy !!
