On the back of ever more powerful computers and graphical user interfaces CFD provides engineers with a reliable tool to assist in the design of industrial equipment often reducing or eliminating the need for performing trial-and-error experimentation.\n\nAn Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics is the ideal text for the newcomer to the area whether they be undergraduates, graduates, or professionals. It provides thorough yet accessible coverage of commercial finite volume based CFD codes within the context of the underlying theory, giving the reader a full appreciation of CFD and its numerous engineering applications.\n\nKey features\n* Offers essential support for novice users of commercial CFD codes such as ANSYS CFX, FLUENT, STAR-CD and PHOENICS.\n* Covers fluids and turbulence physics together with computational modelling techniques\n* Uses a step-by-step approach to introduce the methodology\n* Chapter summaries and worked examples throughout to reinforce understanding of the key concepts\n\nNew to this edition\n* A new chapter describing unstructured meshing techniques\n*A new chapter on CFD uncertainty\n*New coverage of the fundamentals of Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) techniques\n*Summaries of TVD techniques and multi-grid solution techniques\n*Added examples of the SIMPLE algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling\n*Two new chapters with advanced material covering combustion and radiative heat transfer modelling\n\nH K Versteeg and W Malalasekera are both senior lecturers in Thermo-Fluids, at Loughborough University.\n\nThis established, leading textbook, is suitable for courses in CFD. The new edition covers new techniques and methods, as well as considerable expansion of the advanced topics and applications (from one to four chapters).\n\nThis book presents the fundamentals of computational fluid mechanics for the novice user. It provides a thorough yet user-friendly introduction to the governing equations and boundary conditions of viscous fluid flows, turbulence and its modelling, and the finite volume method of solving flow problems on computers.\n\nSEED as long as you can","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b44b8d69c4f29d937ad46ec239a152f368f5d3cc","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Computational+Fluid+Dynamics%3A+The+Finite+Volu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b44b8d69c4f29d937ad46ec239a152f368f5d3cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,75,141,105,196,242,157,147,122,212,110,194,57,161,82,243,104,245,211,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
