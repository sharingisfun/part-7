It is the first installment in the Dylan bootleg series, comprising material spanning the first three decades of his career, from 1961 to 1989. It has been certified with a gold record by the RIAA as of August 1997, and peaked at #49 on the Billboard 200 and #32 in the UK\nOf the 58 total tracks, 46 are session outtakes from the recording sessions for studio albums. The remaining dozen tracks are with one exception live recordings and demo records, three of latter being later duplicated on Volume 9 of the series.  Released in 1991 to satisfy enormous demand for Dylan's much-bootlegged unissued material, it contains rarities and unreleased works from the sessions for 1962's eponymous debut Bob Dylan to 1989's Oh Mercy. Unlike subsequent editions, which to date have all been double-disc packages, each volume in this set is a single compact disc, and the three volumes are not available separately..\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Hard Times In New York Town\n[02] He Was A Friend Of Mine\n[03] Man On The Street\n[04] No More Auction Block\n[05] House Carpenter\n[06] Talkin' Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues\n[07] Let Me Die In My Footsteps\n[08] Rambling, Gambling Willie\n[09] Talkin' Hava Negeilah Blues\n[10] Quit Your Low Down Ways\n[11] Worried Blues\n[12] Kingsport Town\n[13] Walkin' Down The Line\n[14] Walls Of Red Wing\n[15] Paths Of Victory\n[16] Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\n[17] Who Killed Davey Moore?\n[18] Only A Hobo\n[19] Moonshiner\n[20] When The Ship Comes In\n[21] The Times They Are A-Changin'\n[22] Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 01h:17m:04s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Seven Curses\n[02] Eternal Circle\n[03] Suze (The Cough Song)\n[04] Mama, You Been On My Mind\n[05] Farewell, Angelina\n[06] Subterranean Homesick Blues\n[07] If You Gotta Go, Go Now (Or Else You Got To Stay All Night)\n[08] Sitting On A Barbed Wire Fence\n[09] Like A Rolling Stone\n[10] It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry\n[11] I'll Keep It With Mine\n[12] She's Your Lover Now\n[13] I Shall Be Released\n[14] Santa-Fe\n[15] If Not For You\n[16] Wallflower\n[17] Nobody 'Cept You\n[18] Tangled Up In Blue\n[19] Call Letter Blues\n[20] Idiot Wind\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 01h:16m:40s\n\nCD-03 Track Listings\n\n[01] If You See Her, Say Hello\n[02] Golden Loom\n[03] Catfish\n[04] Seven Days\n[05] Ye Shall Be Changed\n[06] Every Grain Of Sand\n[07] You Changed My Life\n[08] Need A Woman\n[09] Angelina\n[10] Someone's Got A Hold Of My Heart\n[11] Tell Me\n[12] Lord Protect My Child\n[13] Foot Of Pride\n[14] Blind Willie McTell\n[15] When The Night Comes Falling From The Sky\n[16] Series Of Dreams\n\n\tCD-03 Play Time - 01h:16m:52s\n\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 03h:50m:36s\nTotal File Size....................... 589mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
