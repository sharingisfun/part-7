Very sorry to all who were frustrated with the last version 0.12. \nI guess I haven't gotten enough sleep yet.\n\n\nv0.12\nChanged a couple of lines of code to fix the unnecessary messages that appear at times due to ending parts of the code prematurely.\nDue to completely to a lack of sleep and writing the code going to bed, If I remember correctly. I am sorry about that and I hope this will alleviate any confusion.\n\n\nv0.11\nAdded the possibility to automatically close any open Quickbooks or Intuit programs that may interfere with the backing up, replacing and restoring of the patched file, provided a certain Windows program exists.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b23a5e4defe8357bab74e086f3a63b5e7a35d1ff","amp;dn":"Quickbooks+2013+Activator+v0.13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b23a5e4defe8357bab74e086f3a63b5e7a35d1ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,58,94,77,239,232,53,123,171,116,224,134,243,166,59,94,122,53,209,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
