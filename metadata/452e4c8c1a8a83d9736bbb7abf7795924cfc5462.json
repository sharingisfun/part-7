He knows what he wants, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll go after it no-holds-barred.\n\nAnd what he wants is Charlotte Baird.\n\nCharlotte knows sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a mouse. Emotionally scarred and painfully shy, she just wants to do her job and remain as invisible as possible. But the new CEOÃ¢â‚¬â€a brilliant, broad-shouldered T-Rex of a man who growls and storms through the office, leaving carnage in his wakeÃ¢â‚¬â€clearly has other plans. Plans that may be equal parts business and bedroom.\n\nIf Charlotte intends to survive this battle of wits and hearts, the mouse will have to learn to wrangle the T-Rex.\n\nWritten by Nalini Singh\nRead by Justine O.
