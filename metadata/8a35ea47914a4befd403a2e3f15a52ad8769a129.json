Although it would have been preferable to hear Coltrane play in the Duke Ellington orchestra instead of the other way around, the results are quite rewarding. Their version of &quot;In a Sentimental Mood&quot; is a high point, and such numbers as &quot;Take the Coltrane,&quot; &quot;Big Nick,&quot; and &quot;My Little Brown Book&quot; are quite memorable. Ellington always recognized talent, and Coltrane seemed quite happy to be recording with a fellow genius.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n01.
