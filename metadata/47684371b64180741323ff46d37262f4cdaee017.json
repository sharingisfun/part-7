Ajayan et al. (Wiley-VCH, 2003).pdf\r\n\r\nIn recent years, nanocomposites have captured and held the attention and imagination of scientists and engineers alike. Based on the simple premise that by using a wide range of building blocks with dimensions in the nonosize region, it is possible to design and create new materials with unprecedented flexibility and improvements in their physical properties.\r\nThis book contains the essence of this emerging technology, the underlying science and motivation behind the design of these structures and the future, particularly from the perspective of applications. It is intended to be a reference handbook for future scientists and hence carries the basic science and the fundamental engineering principles that lead to the fabrication and property evaluation of nonocomposite materials in different areas of materials science and technology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47684371b64180741323ff46d37262f4cdaee017","amp;dn":"Nanocomposite+Science+and+Technology+-+P.M.+Ajayan+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47684371b64180741323ff46d37262f4cdaee017","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,104,67,113,182,65,128,116,19,35,255,70,211,114,98,244,205,174,224,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
