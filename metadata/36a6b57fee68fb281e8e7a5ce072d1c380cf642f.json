It was released on 10 May 2005 in the UK, Australia (as Ultimate Aaliyah), and Japan (as Special Edition: Rare Tracks and Visuals). It includes two CDs and one DVD video disc.  The first compact disc is a greatest hits collection, including all of Aaliyah's significant U.S. hits (in their LP versions) and two of her minor UK hits, but leaves out her top ten R&amp;B hit, &quot;Come Over&quot; (#9 Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs); one of her minor U.S. hits; and the rest of her minor U.K. hits, such as &quot;Age Ain't Nothing But a Number&quot; (#75 U.S. Billboard Hot 100), &quot;Journey to the Past&quot; from the film Anastasia (#22 UK Top 40, #28 Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks), &quot;Down with the Clique&quot; (#33 UK Top 40), &quot;The Thing I Like&quot; from the film A Low Down Dirty Shame (#33 UK Top 40), and &quot;Are You Ready?&quot; from the film Sunset Park (#42 Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay).  The second disc is entitled Are You Feelin' Me? It contains material from soundtracks and from studio albums by labelmate Timbaland. The title track was released as a single in the UK to promote the album but failed to chart. Are You Feelin' Me? was also made available as a standalone download, allowing purchasers to obtain the rarities without duplicating the Greatest Hits.  The bonus DVD runs for sixty minutes, and features The Aaliyah Story Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a documentary compiled of promo clips, interviews, and special features, including MTV special, MTV News Now: The Life of Aaliyah, a Tribute to Aaliyah, Aaliyah's VH1 Behind the Music installment, and her E! True Hollywood Story episode.  Ultimate Aaliyah debuted at #32 on the UK Albums Chart, with 20,000 copies sold. It has sold over 1.4 million copies worldwide.  Special Edition: Rare Tracks and Visuals was released two months later, and included the songs &quot;Are You Feelin' Me?&quot; and &quot;Messed Up&quot; as its first two tracks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as on the second disc of Ultimate Aaliyah Ã¢â‚¬â€œ plus remixes of &quot;Rock The Boat&quot;, &quot;More Than A Woman&quot;, and &quot;Try Again&quot;. The DVD contains the same documentary as Ultimate Aaliyah.\n\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] One In A Million\n[02] If Your Girl Only Knew - - - Aaliyah Featuring Timbaland &amp; Missy Elliott\n[03] Hot Like Fire - - - Aaliyah Featuring Timbaland &amp; Missy Elliott\n[04] The One I Gave My Heart To\n[05] Got To Give It Up - - - Aaliyah Featuring Slick Rick\n[06] 4 Page Letter\t\n[07] We Need A Resolution - - - Aaliyah Featuring Timbaland\n[08] Rock The Boat\n[09] More Than A Woman\n[10] I Care 4 U\n[11] Try Again - - - Aaliyah Featuring Timbaland\n[12] Back &amp; Forth - - - Aaliyah Featuring R Kelly\n[13] Are You That Somebody? - - - Aaliyah Featuring Timbaland\n[14] Don't Know What To Tell Ya\n[15] Miss You\n[16] At Your Best\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 01h:12m:03s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Are You Feelin' Me?\n[02] Messed Up\n[03] Come Back In One Piece - - - Aaliyah Featuring DMX\n[04] I Don't Wanna\n[05] Man Undercover\n[06] John Blaze\n[07] I Am Music\n[08] More Than A Woman (Bump N Flex Club Mix)\n[09] Hold On\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 00h:38m:45s\n\nDVD Contents\n\n[01] The Aaliyah Story\n[02] Photo Gallery\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............. 01h:50m:48s\nTotal File Size....................... 3.77GBs (Including DVD, FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
