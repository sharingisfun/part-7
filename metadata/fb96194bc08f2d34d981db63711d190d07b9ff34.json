Signing with Capitol after a feeding frenzy of label offers, the Knack released their debut, Get the Knack, in 1979. With its leadoff single, &quot;My Sharona,&quot; the Knack climbed both the album and singles charts (eventually selling millions of copies around the globe), gained wide commercial acceptance, and regenerated the power pop scene that had laid dormant for half a decade.\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.My Sharona\n02.Your Number Or Your Name\n03.One Day At A Time\n04.The Hard Way\n05.Good Girls Don't\n06.(She's So) Selfish\n07.Just Wait And See\n08.Baby Talks Dirty\n09.We Are Waiting\n10.I Want Love\n11.Africa\n12.Can't Put A Price On Love\n13.Rocket O' Love (Demo Version)\n14.Another Lousy Day In Paradise\n15.Sweet Dreams\n16.Don't Look Back (Previously Unreleased)\n17.Pay The Devil (Ooo Baby Ooo)\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb96194bc08f2d34d981db63711d190d07b9ff34","amp;dn":"The+Knack+-+Retrospective+The+Best+Of+%281992%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb96194bc08f2d34d981db63711d190d07b9ff34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,150,25,75,192,143,45,52,217,129,219,99,113,29,25,13,7,185,255,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
