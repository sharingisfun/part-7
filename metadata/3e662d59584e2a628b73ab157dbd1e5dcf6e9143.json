When two vowels appear together, each is pronounced as a separate syllable. For example, babae (woman) is pronounced as ba-ba-e.\nFilipino uses affixes, which are letters that attach to root words. Affixes determine the wordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s meaning. For example: \nwill eat\tkakain\nis eating\tkumakain\nate\tkumain\nLearning prepositions is easy in Filipino since the language has only two prepositions, nasa and sa.\nContractions are commonly used in Filipino. For example:\npula na libro (red book) becomes pulang libro\nbata na lalaki (young male) becomes batang lalaki\nFilipino speakers employ polite speech when conversing with strangers or elders. Use of the word po or plural pronouns in speech are common ways to show respect.\nWhen asking a question that can be answered with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“yesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“no,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ speakers use the question marker ba. Rosetta Stone will teach you how to use this important word in asking questions.\nIn addition to learning the Filipino words for numbers, you will learn the Spanish words for the numbers one through twelve, which are used in telling time.\n\nThis level will help you:\n\nLearn intermediate-level conversational skills\nSpell and write accurately\nSpeak without a script\nRetain what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve learned\nRead and understand in your new language\nSample topics include:\n\nDestinations, directions, locations, telling time\nPast and future tenses\nLetter writing and polite requests\nCelebrations, meal courses\nEmotions\n\nRequirements for Rosetta Stone User Workstations\n\nWindows 2000 or later\nMac OS 10.4 or later\n512 MB RAM\n1 GHz or faster processor speed\n600 MB free hard-drive space (per level)\n16-bit sound card\n800 x 600 display resolution (1024 x 768 recommended)\nInternet or phone connection required for product activation\nSpeech recognition feature requires a USB headset microphone (included with purchase)\n16X CD-ROM Drive (for installation)\nNote for MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Windows VistaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ users:\n\nCurrent Rosetta Stone products have been engineered to install and run on the Windows Vista operating system.
