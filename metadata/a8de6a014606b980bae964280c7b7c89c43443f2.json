But when the confused and curious boy discovers that a mysterious virus is spreading through town, he decides to enter an otherworldly house to stop it. After meeting Suzy Blue and the first part of &quot;the Will&quot; (a frog-looking entity that knows everything about the House), Arthur learns that he's been selected as Rightful Heir to the House and must get the other part of the clock hand in order to defeat Monday. That means getting past Monday's henchmen and journeying to the Dayroom itself. Thankfully, Arthur is up to the challenge, but as he finds out, his fight seems to be only one-seventh over.\n\nWith a weapon-wielding hero and a villain who doesn't make Mondays any nicer, Nix's Keys to the Kingdom launch is imaginative and gripping. After an action-packed crescendo to the book's middle -- when Arthur finally learns his destiny -- Nix keeps the drama going and doesn't let it fall. By the end, you might be winded from all the fantastic explanation, but you'll definitely be salivating for what's to come. Matt Warner\n\n\n\nBook 2: Grim Tuesday\nThe second incredible book in The Keys to the Kingdom, now in hardcover\n\nArthur doesn't think he will ever have to return to the strange house that nearly killed him on Monday -- the house that contains an entire world. But Tuesday brings new challenges -- in the form of an enemy named Grim Tuesday, who threatens the well-being of both Arthur's family and his world. Arthur must retrieve the Second Key from Grim Tuesday in order to save everything -- an adventure that will include stealing a Sunship, surviving a very weird work camp, befriending a bearlike spirit, fighting the voidlike Nithlings, and traveling to the scary Far Reaches for the ultimate showdown.\n\n\n\nBook 3: Drowned Wednesday\nOn the third day, there were pirates.\n\nWednesday has rolled around, and Arthur Penhaligon has an invitation to return to the House that he can't refuse. Drowned Wednesday has sent a ship to pick him up from the hospital...even though his hometown is miles away from any ocean.\n\nFrom hospital room to the high seas, Arthur finds himself on an adventure that will pit him against pirates, storms, explosions of Nothing-laced gunpowder, and a vast beast that eats everything it encounters. Through it all, he is drawn deeper into the central mystery of the House. Arthur must find the third part of the Will and claim the Third Key - not just for himself, but for the millions (if not trillions) who will suffer if he doesn't.\n\nThe first step? Surviving life aboard a ship on the Border Sea...\n\n\n\nBook 4: Sir Thursday\nThe stellar fourth book in Garth Nix's masterpiece series... now in paperback! \nOn the fourth day there was war...\nFollowing their adventures in the Border Sea, Arthur and Leaf head for home. But only Leaf gets through the Front Door. Arthur is blocked because someone . . . or something . . . has assumed his identity and is taking over his life.\nBefore Arthur can take action, he is drafted by Sir Thursday and forced to join the Glorious Army of the Architect. While Leaf tries to banish Arthur's doppleganger on earth, Arthur must survive his basic training, avoid getting posted to the Front and work out how he can free Part Four of the Will....\n\n\n\nBook 5: Lady Friday\nThe fifth book in Garth Nix's New York Times bestselling series!\n\nFour of the seven Trustees have been defeated and their Keys taken, but for Arthur, the week is still getting worse. Suzy Blue and Fred Gold Numbers have been captured by the Piper, and his New Nithling army still controls most of the Great Maze. Superior Saturday is causing trouble wherever she can, including turning off all the elevators in the House and blocking the Front Door. \nAmidst all this trouble, Arthur must weigh an offer from Lady Friday that is either a cunning trap for the Rightful Heir or a golden opportunity he must seize - before he's beaten to it!\n\n\n\nBook 6: Superior Saturday\nOn the sixth day, there was sorcery.\n\nArthur Penhaligan has wrested five of the Keys from their immortal guardians, the Trustees of the Will. But gaining the Sixth Key poses a greater challenge than any he has faced before. Superior Saturday is not just one of the Trustees Ã¢â‚¬â€œ she is also the oldest Denizen and the most powerful and knowledgeable sorcerer within the House. She has tens of thousands of sorcerers at her command, and she has been preparing her forces all along for the WillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s escape and the activities of the Rightful Heir. \n\nAs SaturdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s schemes become evident, Arthur is beset on all sides. The House is being destroyed, and only the power of the Keys can hold back the tide of destruction. ArthurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home city is under attack. His allies are unreliable. He canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even get into the apparently impregnable Upper House . . . and even if he does, finding the Sixth Part of the Will and gaining the Sixth Key might not be enough to counter SaturdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bid for ultimate power. \n\nThe Stakes are getting higher and higher. Can Arthur survive?\n\n\n\nBook 7: Lord Sunday\nOn the seventh day, there was a choice.\n\nThe House is falling apart, and when it is destroyed, all existence will be destroyed with it, Arthur Penhaligon and his friends Leaf and Suzy are caught in the chaos, separated by events but drawn together in their fight to survive. They must use every power at their disposal - magical or practical - to defeat the enemies attacking them from all sides.\n\nFor Arthur, the biggest challenge comes from Lord Sunday, the most illusive of the trustees of the will. Lord Sunday's magic is unlike any Arthur has encountered before - and his secrets have the potential to destroy not only Arthur but also the people he holds most dear.\n\nOn Monday, Arthur Penhaligon was just an ordinary boy thrust into an extraordinary situation. From Tuesday to Saturday, he emerged as the Rightful Heir to the Architect who created everything within the House. Now, on Sunday, he will face a choice of astonishing proportions - the remarkable conclusion to a completely unforeseen adventure.\n\n\nGenre: Childrens | Adventure | Fantasy | Science Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8de6a014606b980bae964280c7b7c89c43443f2","amp;dn":"The+Keys+to+the+Kingdom+series+-+Garth+Nix+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8de6a014606b980bae964280c7b7c89c43443f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,222,106,1,70,6,185,128,186,233,100,40,12,123,124,137,196,52,67,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
