And you know what that means :)\n\nBrought to you by TQMP\nThe Quality Music Project\n\nMisa Negra, the four part suite written in 1969 by Jesus &quot;Chucho&quot; Valdes, from which this Irakere album takes its name, is a musical description of the Yoruba religious ceremony which is still practiced to this day in Cuba. Anthropologically, an important album for anyone interested in native Cuban culture.\nHighly Recommended. (BP, 2004-07-13)\n\nReviews: \n&quot;I'm not sure if I included this in the first Descarga catalog a few years ago. If I didn't, I should have. If I did, please disregard. This is the best of the post-Paquito (D'Rivera) and Arturo (Sandoval) Irakere groupings and recordings of the 80s. This CD shows why Chucho Valdes' group has remained atop the heap and continues undisputed as the most important jazz ensemble in Cuban history. The playing and arrangements are hot, sweaty and inspiring. An ear and eye opening recording that will have your jaw dragging the floor. Cuban jazz at its best.
