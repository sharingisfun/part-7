It is considered to be one of the most detailed descriptions of the inner workings and leadership of Nazi Germany but is controversial because of Speer's lack of discussion of Nazi atrocities and questions regarding his degree \n\nCreation\n\nAt the Nuremberg Trials, Speer was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his use of slave labor while Minister of Armaments. From 1946 to 1966, while serving the sentence in Spandau Prison, he penned 1,300 manuscript pages of personal memoirs. Because he was not allowed to write such memoirs while in prison, he smuggled these notes out, and returned to them after his release. He was aided by Joachim Fest. The manuscript led to two books: first Erinnerungen (&quot;Recollections&quot;) (PropylÃƒÂ¤en/Ullstein, 1969), which was translated into English and published by Macmillan in 1970 as Inside the Third Reich; then Spandauer TagebÃƒÂ¼cher (&quot;Spandau Diaries&quot;) (PropylÃƒÂ¤en/Ullstein, 1975), which was translated into English and published by Macmillan in 1976 as Spandau: The Secret Diaries.\ne of awareness or involvement with them.\n\nOverview\n\nInside the Third Reich is written in a semi-autobiographical style. While Speer begins with his childhood, he spends most of the memoirs describing his work in the Nazi hierarchy.\n\nSpeer, by his account, entered the Nazi hierarchy by an unusual chain of events. He said that he first joined after attending a rally, at the behest of some of his students, at which Hitler spoke. Early on Speer was used mainly as a driver due to his being the only member with a car in the Wannsee area. As an architect commissioned by the party, he achieved an excellent turnaround time on a building project, which attracted attention from senior leaders. Because Adolf Hitler saw himself as both an architect and artist, he warmed to Speer and gradually brought him into his inner circle.\n\nDue to his relative closeness to Hitler, Speer found himself in an enviable but precarious position. He later remarked, &quot;I would have been Hitler's best friendÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ if Hitler had been capable of having friends.&quot;\n\nHis duties until 1942 were occupied exclusively by architectural work, mainly large works that Hitler planned but would never build. Then, after the Minister of Armaments, Fritz Todt, died in a plane crash, Hitler unexpectedly tapped Speer for the position.\n\nUnder Speer, German arms production improved greatly. Prior to his appointment, the economy was run by Hermann GÃƒÂ¶ring. However, GÃƒÂ¶ring had fallen out of favor. After a power struggle, Speer managed to get most of the economy under his control. (Some aspects of it had fallen under the control of Heinrich Himmler's secret police, and remained so until the collapse of government.)\n\nSpeer introduced economic reforms that the United States and Great Britain had implemented long beforeÃ¢â‚¬â€namely, the full mobilization of factories for war purposes and the use of female workers. However, although more arms were produced, by the time Speer accomplished this, the war was already lost. Many people among the Western allies believed that the dictatorship in Germany gave that country's wartime economy frightening advantages by creating great efficiencies throughout the economy (in comparison to the cacophony of forces that shaped the production possibilities curve in democracies). Speer took pains in his memoirs to argue that this theory was not supported by the facts. In fact, he felt that in some ways the democracies ended up with better efficiencies in production than Germany did. He judged that the pathological secrecy and corruption within a dictatorial system more than canceled out the theoretical benefits of greater centralization.\n\nBy the end of the war, Speer was disillusioned by the war, by the Nazis, and with Hitler himself. Despite being one of the few people to stay close to Hitler until the end, he sabotaged Hitler's scorched earth policy to prevent the complete destruction of Germany. The main body effectively ends when Speer, by this point having joined Karl DÃƒÂ¶nitz's government seated in Schleswig-Holstein, receives news of Hitler's death. This is followed by an epilogue dealing with the end of the war in Europe and the resulting Nuremberg Trials, in which Speer is sentenced to a two-decade prison sentence for his actions during the war.\n\nThe memoirs Inside the Third Reich end as Speer begins his 20-year term in Spandau Prison. His memoirs Spandau: The Secret Diaries cover the following span of incarceration\n\nSignificance\n\nSpeer was one of the highest-ranking Nazi officials to survive both the war and the Nuremberg trials. He was also, even during World War II, described by both sides as one of the most intelligent people in the Nazi hierarchy. Because of these factors, Inside the Third Reich has become the definitive work on the inner workings of Nazi Germany.\n\nDue to his position, Speer was able to describe the personalities of many Nazi officials, including Joseph Goebbels, Hermann GÃƒÂ¶ring, Heinrich Himmler, Rudolf Hess, Martin Bormann and, of course, Adolf Hitler himself\n\nDescription of the Nazi hierarchy\n\n\nSpeer's memoirs revolutionized the study of Nazi Germany. At the time, the popular vision of Nazi Germany was that of a country as a monolithic, totalitarian state that ran smoothly and proficiently at first before gradually breaking down under the strains of war. Speer revealed that the country was actually sharply divided from the start by overlapping responsibilities, court politics, and incompetent leaders. Most surprisingly, he portrayed Hitler not as an intelligent, decisive leader, but rather as a lazy, artistically tempered bohemian who worked in spurts. He also described Hitler as an incompetent, unprofessional, self-taught layman: &quot;Without any sense of the complexities of any great task, he boldly assumed one function after another.&quot;[1]\n\nSpeer's personal insights into Nazi leaders themselves are nothing short of remarkable, especially since many other Nazis and their families chose him as a neutral confidant. Speer described how Joseph Goebbels' wife, Magda, complained about her husband's infidelity, and how she in turn had had an affair with one of Speer's old friends, Karl Hanke. Personally meeting with GÃƒÂ¶ring on his estate, Speer wrote how the by-then overweight Luftwaffe marshal spent his days hunting, eating, and quite literally playing with stolen jewels as if they were toys.\n\nAccording to Speer, even during the mid-1930s, after he attained dictatorial powers, Hitler had extremely unstable work habits that included staying up very late (typically until 5:00 or 6:00 a.m.) and then sleeping until about noon, spending hours upon hours at meals and tea parties, and wasting both his time and that of colleagues with movies and long, boring monologues. He was incapable of normal office work. In the memoirs, Speer openly wondered when exactly Hitler ever found time to do anything important. On his personal life, Speer remarked that Eva Braun had told him, in the middle of 1943, that Hitler was too busy, too immersed, and too tired to have sex with her.\n\nListening to the FÃƒÂ¼hrer, Speer concluded that Hitler was incapable of growth, either emotional or intellectual. Because Hitler could charm people (including Speer himself), Speer also believed Hitler was a sociopath and megalomaniac. Even in 1945, when Germany's armed forces were all but destroyed, Speer could not convince Hitler to admit defeat, or even to go on the defensive.\n\nAccording to Speer, Germany's position in the war went into decline during the siege of Stalingrad and the Second Battle of El Alamein, when Hitler, faced with defeat in both battles, tried to hide himself from reality. In Hitler's reticence, Speer claimed that Hitler's personal secretary, Martin Bormann, took advantage of the vacuum and controlled all information going to Hitler in a bid to gain power for himself.\n\nLikewise, Speer painted an extremely unflattering portrait of the Nazi government. Because of Hitler's indecisivenessÃ¢â‚¬â€and his belief that struggle led to strengthÃ¢â‚¬â€the government was never properly coordinated. Different ministries were often assigned to the same task and Hitler refused to clarify jurisdictions. As a result, for anything to get done, ministers often had to engage in court politics. Speer himself had to ally with Goebbels and other ministers to counter GÃƒÂ¶ring's incompetent economic leadership. Also, commentators on the memoirs have pronounced it likely that Speer himself came close to being assassinated by Himmler after he unwittingly put himself in the care of an SS doctor.\n\nControversy about the Holocaust and slave labor\n\nIn the book, as at the Nuremberg Trials, Speer denied any knowledge of the Holocaust. While he does admit to his knowledge of slave labor used in his ministry, Speer claimed that he tried to improve the slave laborers' condition, and that he preferred not to use such labor.\n\nEven his editorial aide, Joachim Fest, noted in later editions of Inside the Third Reich that much of what Speer wrote disagreed with his testimony at Nuremberg. Most notably, Speer originally made up excuses as to why he stayed with Hitler until the end, but in his memoirs, admitted he did so out of personal loyalty.\n\nIn the book, Speer claimed to have contemplated Hitler's assassination in early 1945 to end the war. However, aside from an affidavit from one of his friends, Dieter Stahl, there is no evidence to substantiate this.\n\nMoreover, Speer consented to numerous interviews after his release from prison, and some of the things said in these interviews, like those with Gitta Sereny, contradicted with both his court testimony and memoirs.\n\nSupporters of Speer, such as Fest, claim Speer felt personal guilt about the Nazi genocide, and that he spent his remaining years trying to justify both to himself and the public why he had let himself be deceived. Before his death, Speer compared his work on behalf of the Nazis to that of a man who made a deal with the Devil.\n\nSpeer's detractors argue that his omissions and denials were based on his efforts to avoid execution at Nuremberg. Many accounts of the trial depict Speer as a crafty and intelligent defendant who pulled any string he could in his defense. Moreover, other Nuremberg defendants in positions similar to Speer's were hanged, most notably Fritz Sauckel, who actually worked under Speer's orders. Speer's claim to have tried to kill Hitler is usually cited as one of the main reasons he was spared the noose.\n\nWhile arguments over Speer's guilt are ongoing, Inside the Third Reich is used by historians on all sides as a primary source on the inner workings of the Nazis. Speer's supporters have sardonically noted that even historians who claim Speer is untrustworthy nonetheless incorporate the memoirs into their work.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd2ea7debd956c4d4f2c3dd4380ba3795f9c055d","amp;dn":"Inside+the+Third+Reich+%2C+By+Albert+Speer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd2ea7debd956c4d4f2c3dd4380ba3795f9c055d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,46,167,222,189,149,108,77,79,44,61,212,56,11,163,121,95,156,5,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
