Automobiles on uneven roads and railways on flexible tracks are prominent representatives of ground vehicle systems. All these different kinds of systems are treated in a common way by means of analytical dynamics and control theory. In addition to a detailed modelling of vehicles as multibody systems, the contact theory for rolling wheels and the modelling of guideways by finite element systems as well as stochastic processes are presented. As a particular result of this integrated approach the state equations of the global systems are obtained including the complete interactions between the subsystems considered as independent modules. The fundamentals of vehicle dynamics for longitudinal, lateral and vertical motions and vibrations of automobiles and railways are discussed in detail.\n\nContent Level Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Research\n\nKeywords Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» Automobiles - Longitudinal, lateral, vertical motions - Railways - Vehicle assessment - Vehicle models\n\nTable of contents\n\nSystem Definition and Modeling.- Vehicle Models.- Models for Support and Guidance Systems.- Guideway Models.- Models for Vehicle-Guideway-Systems.- Assessment Criteria.- Computational Methods.- Longitudinal Motions.- Lateral Motions.- Vertical Motions.\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\nPreface\nPreface to the German Edition\nContents\nList of Problems and their Solutions\n2.1 Longitudinal motion of an automobile\n2.2 Rotation matrix for a railway wheelset\n2.3 Angular velocity of a rigid body\n2.4 Angular velocity of a railway wheelset\n2.5 Relative motion during cornering\n2.6 Kinematic rolling of a cylinder\n2.7 Kinematic hunting of a railway wheelset\n2.8 Inertia tensor of a railway wheelset\n2.9 Equations of motion of a railway wheelset\n2.10 Inertia forces at a magnetically levitated (maglev) vehicle\n2.11 Lagrangian equations of motion for a differential gear\n2.12 Equations of motion for the bounce and pitch vibrations of an automobile\n2.13 Equations of motion of a drawbar trailer\n2.14 Application of Neweul formalism on a vehicle model with f = 10 degrees of freedom\n3.1 Mathematical model of a layered leaf spring\n3.2 Slip for a conical wheel\n3.3 Contact area and contact forces for wheel-rail contact\n3.4 Contact forces considering approximated saturation\n3.5 Contact forces and linear equations of motion for a railway wheelset\n3.6 Contact forces for a road vehicle\n3.7 Contact forces and linear equations of motion for a drawbar trailer\n4.1 Modal analysis of a double-span beam\n4.2 White and colored noise\n5.1 State equations of the vertical motion of an actively controlled automobile\n6.1 Stability of a system of second order\n7.1 Stability of the hunting motion of a railway wheelset\n7.2 Unbalance excitation of wheel vibrations\n7.3 Random vibrations of a single wheel\n7.4 Harmonic linearization of self-excited vibrations\n7.5 Harmonic linearization of a forced oscillator\n8.1 Control process of a vehicle wheel\n8.2 Acceleration of an automobile\n9.1 Driving stability of a road vehicle\n9.2 Stabilization of railway wheelsets\n1.
