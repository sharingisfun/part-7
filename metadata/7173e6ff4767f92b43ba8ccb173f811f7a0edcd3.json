In the Arab world, Gibran is regarded as a literary and political rebel. His romantic style was at the heart of a renaissance in modern Arabic literature, especially prose poetry, breaking away from the classical school. In Lebanon, he is still celebrated as a literary hero.\n\nHe is chiefly known in the English-speaking world for his 1923 book The Prophet, an early example of inspirational fiction including a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose. The book sold well despite a cool critical reception, gaining popularity in the 1930s and again especially in the 1960s counterculture. Gibran is the third best-selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi.\n\nGibran was a great admirer of poet and writer Francis Marrash, whose works he had studied at al-Hikma school in Beirut. According to orientalist Shmuel Moreh, Gibran's own works echo Marrash's style, many of his ideas, and at times even the structure of some of his works; Suheil Bushrui and Joe Jenkins have mentioned Marrash's concept of universal love, in particular, in having left a &quot;profound impression&quot; on Gibran. The poetry of Gibran often uses formal language and spiritual terms; as one of his poems reveals: &quot;But let there be spaces in your togetherness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.&quot; \n\nMany of Gibran's writings deal with Christianity, especially on the topic of spiritual love. But his mysticism is a convergence of several different influences: Christianity, Islam, Sufism, Judaism and theosophy. He wrote: &quot;You are my brother and I love you. I love you when you prostrate yourself in your mosque, and kneel in your church and pray in your synagogue. You and I are sons of one faithÃ¢â‚¬â€the Spirit.&quot;\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format, published by Open Road (Philosophical Library):\n\n* Between Night and Morn\n\n* Mirrors of the Soul\n\n* Spirits Rebellious\n\n* Tears and Laughter\n\n* The Procession\n\n* The Secrets of the Heart\n\n* The Treasured Writings of Kahlil Gibran\n\n* Treasury of Kahlil Gibran\n\n   - A Treasury of Kahlil Gibran\n\n   - A Second Treasury of Kahlil Gibran\n\n   - A Third Treasury of Kahlil Gibran\n\n* Wings of Thought\n \n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlil_Gibran&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlil_Gibran&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leb.net/gibran/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leb.net/gibran/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n===================================================================================\n\nAlso, see older collection on Gibran, where individual works are available, here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10064297/Kahlil_Gibran_-_Lebanese_Author_(12_Books)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10064297/Kahlil_Gibran_-_Lebanese_Author_(12_Books)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7173e6ff4767f92b43ba8ccb173f811f7a0edcd3","amp;dn":"Kahlil+Gibran+-+Poetry+%26amp%3B+Prose+%2811+Books%2C+Open+Road%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7173e6ff4767f92b43ba8ccb173f811f7a0edcd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,115,230,255,71,103,249,43,67,186,140,203,23,63,129,31,122,14,220,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
