Formed in Los Angeles in the early &amp;#039;80s, the group consisted of David Roback (vocals, guitar), Steven Roback (vocals, bass), Matt Piucci (vocals, guitar), Will Glenn (keyboards), and Eddie Kalwa (drums). Their first single, &quot;What She&amp;#039;s Done to Your Mind,&quot; was a certifiable hit on college radio, and the band quickly followed with a full-length LP for Enigma in 1983, Emergency Third Rail Power Trip. For 1984&amp;#039;s Explosions in the Glass Palace, (Restless) the band lost David Roback to Opal, but John Thoman took over and Mark Marcum filled in for the departed Eddie Kalwa. The re-formed band recorded the live album Beyond the Sunset (1985, Restless) and Crashing Dream (Island, 1986) before disbanding. David Roback went on to finesse Opal into Mazzy Star, Steven Roback, and Thoman worked as Viva Saturn, and Piucci recorded an album with Crazy Horse ? yes, that Crazy Horse. \n\nFeaturing the dreamy &quot;What She&amp;#039;s Done To Your Mind&quot; and the Byrdsy &quot;This Can&amp;#039;t Be Today&quot; (with the Dream Syndicate&amp;#039;s Kendra Smith), on Emergency Third Rail Power Trip, Rain Parade fashioned traditional, gentle psychedelic pop. Clearly way ahead of their time, it would take years before sleepy music (a la founding Rain Parade member&amp;#039;s David Roback&amp;#039;s Mazzy Star) would catch on, this record sounds no more made in the &amp;#039;80s than in the &amp;#039;60s or &amp;#039;90s. \n\n\n01 Talking in My Sleep 3:47 \n02 This Can&amp;#039;t Be Today 4:35 \n03 I Look Around 3:05 \n04 1 HR Ã‚Â½ Ago 4:12 \n05 Carolyn&amp;#039;s Song 4:05 \n06 What She&amp;#039;s Done to Your Mind 2:55 \n07 Look at Merri 6:33 \n08 Saturday&amp;#039;s Asylum 3:44 \n09 Kaleidoscope 5:34 \n10 You Are My Friend 3:05 \n11 Prisoners 3:50 \n12 Blue 2:54 \n13 Broken Horse 3:42 \n14 No Easy Way Down 6:54 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6d285330b9dbe807c38b7a7ac0d111ad3fe4cb4","amp;dn":"Rain+Parade+-+Emergency+Third+Rail+Power+Trip%2FExplosions+in+the+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6d285330b9dbe807c38b7a7ac0d111ad3fe4cb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,210,133,51,11,157,190,128,124,56,183,167,172,13,17,26,211,254,76,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
