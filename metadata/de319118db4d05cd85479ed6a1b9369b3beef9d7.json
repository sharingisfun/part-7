Covey\nPublisher: \tSt. Martin's Griffin\nDate: \t1997-10-01 \tFormat: \tLit \tLanguage: \tEnglish \tISBN10: \t0307440850 \t\nPages: \t390\n\nFrom the author of the #1 bestseller The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Covey's new bestseller offers precious lessons in creating and sustaining a strong family culture in a turbulent world. No family is free from challenges. But a strong family embodies a problem-solving culture in which parents and children act interdependently, appropriately, and positively. It is a culture that enables all family members to experience the joy, satisfaction, and integrity of living their principles day by day. In his first major work since The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen R. Covey presents a practical and philosophical guide to solving the problems, large and small, mundane and extraordinary - that confront all families at one time or another. With clarity and common sense, Covey demonstrates how the basic principles of the original book are the key to building strong families and strong communities. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Families is an invaluable guidebook to the welfare of families everywhere. Stephen R. Covey is recognized by Time magazine as one of North America's twenty-five most influential people. He is chairman of the Franklin Covey Company.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de319118db4d05cd85479ed6a1b9369b3beef9d7","amp;dn":"The+7+Habits+of+Highly+Effective+Families","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de319118db4d05cd85479ed6a1b9369b3beef9d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,49,145,24,219,77,5,205,133,71,158,214,161,185,54,155,59,238,249,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
