Vinge is solicited to secretly work for N.F. Sieger, who commands DenmarkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s largest shipping and oil company. Sieger wants Vinge to find another successor to head his company besides his son Daniel. What seems like a simple job of vetting potential candidates and offering his recommendations soon entangles Vinge in a much larger struggle of corporate greed and violence. As the battle for control of the corporation plays out, Vinge is right in the thick of it. All of this comes at a cost as the game being played puts a strain on VingeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relationships and personal life, and he discovers that his job as headhunter may be much more than he bargained for.\n\nSource        : Region 2 PAL retail\nPlaytime      : 103 min\nResolution    : 624x256 (2.44)\nVideo bitrate : 857 kbit AVG\nAudio bitrate : 122 kbit MP3 VBR Danish \nSubtitles     : Danish, English, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish\n\ncredit RCDiVX &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae8c98df8dc87bafaa124af1fff02aa188145711","amp;dn":"Headhunter.2009.DVDRiP.XViD-RCDiVX%28ENG+SUBS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae8c98df8dc87bafaa124af1fff02aa188145711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,140,152,223,141,200,123,175,170,18,74,241,255,240,42,161,136,20,87,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
