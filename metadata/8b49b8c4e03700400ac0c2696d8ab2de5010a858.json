It was recorded and produced at Abbey Road and AIR Studios. It took Jason Pierce, Spiritualized&amp;#039;s lead singer, guitarist and sole constant member four years to write, perform, produce and release. The album utilizes 115 session musicians, including orchestra and London Community Gospel Choir. The wall of sound technique (most notably used by 60&amp;#039;s record producer Phil Spector) is evident on this album, especially on such tracks as Do It All Over Again, Stop Your Crying and The Straight And The Narrow. It is unusual amongst Spiritualized&amp;#039;s other releases in that it doesn&amp;#039;t utilize many of the bands usual trademarks, such as guitar effects pedals, free jazz and drones, being a mostly orchestral work.\n\n1.
