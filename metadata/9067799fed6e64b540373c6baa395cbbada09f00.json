Now his stretch is up and he wants Velma back.\r\n\r\nPI Philip Marlow meets Malloy one hot day in Hollywood and, out of the generosity of his jaded heart, agrees to help him. Dragged from one smoky bar to another, Marlowe's search for Velma turns up plenty of dangerous gangsters with a nasty habit of shooting first and talking later. And soon what started as a search for a missing person becomes a matter of life and death....\r\n\r\nRay Porter is good but I keep hearing Robert Mitchum in my head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Ray Porter\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged\r\nLength: 7 hrs and 47 mins\r\nRelease Date:12-09-14\r\nPublisher: Audible Studios","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9067799fed6e64b540373c6baa395cbbada09f00","amp;dn":"Raymond+Chandler+-+Farewell%2C+My+Lovely+%28Philip+Marlowe+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9067799fed6e64b540373c6baa395cbbada09f00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,103,121,159,237,110,100,181,64,55,60,107,170,57,92,187,173,160,159,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
