This practical guide covers such topics as mantra meditation, contemplation, and visualization within a Jewish context. It shows us how to use meditative techniques to enhance prayer using the traditional liturgyÃ¢â‚¬â€the Amidah and the Shema. Through simple exercises and clear explanations of theory, Rabbi Kaplan gives us the tools to develop our spiritual potential through an authentically Jewish meditative practice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c6b727a2cd9b94b977bdf07884fafae0af48c43","amp;dn":"Jewish+Meditation%3A+A+Practical+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c6b727a2cd9b94b977bdf07884fafae0af48c43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,107,114,122,44,217,185,75,151,123,223,7,136,79,175,174,10,244,140,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
