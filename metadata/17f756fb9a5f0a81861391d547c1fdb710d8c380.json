Tonight, the duo decides to treat fans to an early X-mas gift and release their first single Ã¢â‚¬Å“AyoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nProduced by Nic Nac (who did &quot;Loyal&quot;), the club-friendly record finds T-Rawww leading things off and addressing the ladies, while Breezy handles the catchy chorus and raps about Ice T's wife &amp; his stint in rehab (&quot;Rehabilitation just had me worried Ã¢â‚¬â„¢bout fuckinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). It's another strong addition to the duo's steadily growing catalogue of hits, and may just have the ingredients to take over the radio airwaves. Look for these two to hit the road together as part of the &quot;Between The Sheets&quot; tour starting early next year. \n\nTake a listen and let us know what ya think! Is it a hit or nah?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17f756fb9a5f0a81861391d547c1fdb710d8c380","amp;dn":"Chris+Brown+%26amp%3B+Tyga+-+Ayo+%5B2015%5D+%5BSingle%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17f756fb9a5f0a81861391d547c1fdb710d8c380","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,247,86,251,154,95,10,129,134,19,145,213,71,193,253,183,16,216,195,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
