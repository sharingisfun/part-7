It seeks to deepen readers' understanding of themselves, the work they do, and how this intersects with the lives and crises of people with mental illness. This book adopts a storytelling approach, which encourages engagement with the lives and needs of consumers and carers in mental health. Each chapter features learning objectives, reflective and critical thinking questions, extension activities and further reading. Mental Health: a person-centred approach is a comprehensive resource which utilises fresh thinking to support the development of safe, high-quality, person-centred care in both the Australian and New Zealand context.\n\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 370 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (February 10, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1107667720\nISBN-13: 978-1107667723\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d61873a04759fe15a519c5392188ec37cf97460d","amp;dn":"Mental+Health%3A+A+Person-centred+Approach+%282014%29+by+Nicholas+Proc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d61873a04759fe15a519c5392188ec37cf97460d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,24,115,160,71,89,254,21,165,25,197,57,33,136,236,55,207,151,70,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
