It isn't actual C-4 as for military uses, but it do the job. If you are intelligent, finding the chemicals isn't hard.\n   \n   It was a great book. Very Informing. I've read several books on survivalism pertaining to home made explosives, this is one of the best. I believe the price Amazon is asking for is a little outrageous... But that was about 4 years ago. A lot of the material is outdated, like Ammonium Nitrate. Ever since Mr. McVeigh went Ryder happy, they stopped selling Ammonium Nitrate based fertilizer, but I'm sure there are other sources of Ammonium Nitrate. In conclusion, it's a great book no survivalist should be caught without","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17d8c3fd0ae91245509ff3b37f7bb003deec265e","amp;dn":"Ragnar+Benson-Homemade+C-4-A+Recipe+for+Survival+%281990%29pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17d8c3fd0ae91245509ff3b37f7bb003deec265e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,216,195,253,10,233,18,69,80,159,243,179,127,123,176,3,222,236,38,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
