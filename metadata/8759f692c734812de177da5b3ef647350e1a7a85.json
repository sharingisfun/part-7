Reproduced in stunning colour, this is the definitive guide to the Star Trek universe. From Qo'noS to Bajor, from Vulcan to the farthest reaches of the Delta Quadrant, these charts reveal the location of every major Star Trek world and star system. In addition to maps of the stars themselves there are mission charts for each of the main starships featured in the various Star Trek series, from the Enterprise commanded by Captain Kirk in the original classic series to the USS Voyager on her epic journey of exploration, and now back to the very first Enterprise of all as seen in the brand new Star Trek series, ENTERPRISE. PLUS as a special bonus there are charts from the upcoming tenth Star Trek feature film, Nemesis, currently scheduled for release in December 2001.\n\nAbout the Author\nGeoffrey Mandel has worked on Star Trek for four years after previous stints on JAG and The X-Files. His work can be seen on screen every week on the new series ENTERPRISE and in the forthcoming Star Trek feature film, NEMESIS.
