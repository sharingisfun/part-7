In The Great Debate, Yuval Levin explores the origins of the left/right divide in America by examining the views of the men who best represent each side of that debate: Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine. In a groundbreaking exploration of the roots of our political order, Levin shows that American partisanship originated in the debates over the French Revolution, fueled by the fiery rhetoric of these ideological titans. \n\nLevin masterfully shows how Burke and PaineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s differing views continue to shape our current political discourseÃ¢â‚¬â€on issues ranging from gun control and abortion to welfare and economic reform. Essential reading for anyone seeking to understand WashingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s often acrimonious rifts, The Great Debate offers a profound examination of what conservatism, liberalism, and the debate between them truly amount to. \n\nin epub and mobi format","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b3b7bf2dedf94ae36386482a8857e831bc55e62","amp;dn":"Yuval+Levin+-+The+Great+Debate%3A+Edmund+Burke%2C+Thomas+Paine%2C+and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b3b7bf2dedf94ae36386482a8857e831bc55e62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,59,123,242,222,223,148,174,54,56,100,130,168,133,126,131,27,197,94,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
