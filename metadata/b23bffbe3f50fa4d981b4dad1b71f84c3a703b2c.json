(2008)\n\n\n\n\n\nAC/DC's mammoth power chord roar became one of the most influential hard rock sounds of the '70s. In its own way, it was a reaction against the pompous art rock and lumbering arena rock of the early '70s. AC/DC's rock was minimalist -- no matter how huge and bludgeoning their guitar chords were, there was a clear sense of space and restraint. Combined with Bon Scott's larynx-shredding vocals, the band spawned countless imitators over the next two decades and enjoyed commercial success well into the 2000s.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\t15137-1\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.68% CDDA &amp; 99.83% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Thunderstruck\n02.Shoot To Thrill\n03.Big Gun\n04.Fire Your Guns\n05.You Shook Me All Night Long\n06.Heatseeker\n07.Back In Black\n08.Who Made Who\n09.Hard As A Rock\n10.Hells Bells\n11.Moneytalks\n12.What Do You Do For Money Honey\n13.Are You Ready\n14.Stiff Upper Lip\n15.Ballbreaker\n16.Safe In New York City\n17.That's The Way I Wanna Rock &amp; Roll\n18.Flick Of The Switch\n19.For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Highway To Hell\n02.T.N.T.\n03.Whole Lotta Rosie\n04.The Jack\n05.Girls Got Rhythm\n06.Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\n07.If You Want Blood (You've Got It)\n08.It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'N' Roll)\n09.Sin City\n10.Live Wire\n11.Let There Be Rock\n12.High Voltage\n13.Rock 'N' Roll Damnation\n14.Touch Too Much\n15.Jailbreak\n16.Shot Down In Flames\n17.Kicked In The Teeth\n18.Big Balls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It!****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b23bffbe3f50fa4d981b4dad1b71f84c3a703b2c","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC+-+Warning%21++High+Voltage+Greatest+Hits%21+2CD+%282008%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b23bffbe3f50fa4d981b4dad1b71f84c3a703b2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,59,255,190,63,80,250,77,152,27,77,173,27,113,248,76,58,112,59,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
