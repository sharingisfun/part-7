It contains all the surviving tracks from their various appearances on BBC radio programmes, such as Saturday Club and Top Gear, recorded in 1967. At a BBC radio 'session', a practice still alive in British radio today, a band is required to record material in a studio quickly with limited overdubbing, largely limited to and relying upon their live sound. Many groups as part of this tradition choose to record some songs that are not part of their main repertoire. The album also includes the only two surviving Hendrix UK TV soundtracks (both BBC) Late Night Line Up (&quot;Manic Depression&quot; only survives) and the 1969 Lulu Show (complete).\r\n\r\nBBC Sessions therefore offers its own unique example of the Experience sound, and a revealing glimpse of a song from their early repertoire Howlin' Wolf's &quot;Killing Floor&quot; and their only known studio recording of Bob Dylan's &quot;Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?&quot;.\r\nSource: Wikipedia\r\n\r\n.: Tracklist CD1 :.\r\n\r\n01 - Foxey Lady\r\n02 - Alexis Korner Introduction\r\n03 - Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\r\n04 - Rhythm And Blues World Service\r\n05 - (I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man\r\n06 - Traveling With The Experience\r\n07 - Driving South\r\n08 - Fire\r\n09 - Little Miss Lover\r\n10 - Introducing The Experience\r\n11 - The Burning Of The Midnight Lamp\r\n12 - Catfish Blues\r\n13 - Stone Free\r\n14 - Love Or Confusion\r\n15 - Hey Joe\r\n16 - Hound Dog\r\n17 - Driving South\r\n18 - Hear My Train A Comin'\r\n\r\n\r\n.: Tracklist CD2 :.\r\n\r\n01 - Purple Haze\r\n02 - Killing Floor\r\n03 - Radio One\r\n04 - Wait Until Tomorrow\r\n05 - Day Tripper\r\n06 - Spanish Castle Magic\r\n07 - Jammin'\r\n08 - I Was Made To Love Her\r\n09 - Foxey Lady\r\n10 - A Brand New Sound\r\n11 - Hey Joe\r\n12 - Manic Depression\r\n13 - Driving South\r\n14 - Hear My Train A Comin'\r\n15 - A Happening For Lulu\r\n16 - Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\r\n17 - Lulu Introduction\r\n18 - Hey Joe\r\n19 - Sunshine Of Your Love\r\n\r\n\r\n.: Other Files :.\r\n\r\nlog+cue+m3u+nfo+cover\r\n\r\n|TNT Village by assamestar|\r\n\r\nThis log is created by Rubyripper, version 0.6.2\r\nRipper used: cdparanoia \r\nMatches required for all chunks: 2\r\nMatches required for erroneous chunks: 2\r\nCodec(s) used:\r\n-flac \t-&gt; --best -V (flac 1.3.0)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d73478c6b52c50e895e53e3ad133727f9f8066c9","amp;dn":"The+Jimi+Hendrix+Experience+-+BBC+Sessions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d73478c6b52c50e895e53e3ad133727f9f8066c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,52,120,198,181,44,80,232,149,229,62,58,209,51,114,127,159,128,102,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
