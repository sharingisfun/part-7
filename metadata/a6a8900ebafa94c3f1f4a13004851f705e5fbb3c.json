The unadorned sonic rawness of Steve AlbiniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recording laid bare every primal nuance of the most confrontational yet vulnerable material Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl would ever record. And with its 1991 predecessor Nevermind having sold some 30 million copies, singlehandedly returning honest rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll to the top of the pop charts, In Utero was essentially the first record Nirvana would make with any expectations from the public.\nThis 20th Anniversary 2CD Deluxe Edition of the unwitting swansong of the single most influential band of the 1990s features the original album remastered at Abbey Road Studios plus a veritable treasure trove of never-before-heard demos, mixes, B-sides and bonus tracks from the original album release.\n\nTrack List CD1: Remastered album + B-sides + bonus tracks\n\n1 Serve the Servants\n2 Scentless Apprentice\n3 Heart-Shaped Box\n4 Rape Me\n5 Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\n6 Dumb\n7 Very Ape\n8 Milk It\n9 Pennyroyal Tea\n10 Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\n11 TouretteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\n12 All Apologies\n13 Gallons of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through the Strip\n14 Marigold (B-Side)\n15 Moist Vagina (2013 Mix)\n16 Sappy (2013 Mix)\n17 I Hate Myself and Want to Die (2013 Mix)\n18 Pennyroyal Tea (Scott Litt Mix)\n19 Heart Shaped Box (Original Steve Albini 1993 Mix)\n20 All Apologies (Original Steve Albini 1993 Mix)\n\nTrack List CD2: 2013 Album Mix + Demos\n\n1 Serve the Servants (2013 Mix)\n2 Scentless Apprentice (2013 Mix)\n3 Heart Shaped Box (2013 Mix)\n4 Rape Me (2013 Mix)\n5 Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle (2013 Mix)\n6 Dumb (2013 Mix)\n7 Very Ape (2013 Mix)\n8 Milk It (2013 Mix)\n9 Pennyroyal Tea (2013 Mix)\n10 Radio Friendly Unit Shifter (2013 Mix)\n11 TouretteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (2013 Mix)\n12 All Apologies (2013 Mix)\n13 Scentless Apprentice (Demo)\n14 Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle (Demo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Instrumental)\n15 Dumb (Demo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Instrumental)\n16 Very Ape (Demo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Instrumental)\n17 Pennyroyal Tea (Demo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Instrumental)\n18 Radio Friendly Unit Shifter (Demo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Instrumental)\n19 TouretteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (Demo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Instrumental)\n20 Marigold (Demo)\n21 All Apologies (Demo)\n22 Forgotten Tune (Demo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Instrumental)\n23 Jam (Demo)\n\nTrack List CD3: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Live &amp; LoudÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ show at SeattleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pier 48, 12/13/93\n\n1 Radio Friendly Unit Shifter (Live &amp; Loud)\n2 Drain You (Live &amp; Loud)\n3 Breed (Live &amp; Loud)\n4 Serve the Servants (Live &amp; Loud)\n5 Rape Me (Live &amp; Loud)\n6 Sliver (Live &amp; Loud)\n7 Pennyroyal Tea (Live &amp; Loud)\n8 Scentless Apprentice (Live &amp; Loud)\n9 All Apologies (Live &amp; Loud)\n10 Heart Shaped Box (Live &amp; Loud)\n11 Blew (Live &amp; Loud)\n12 The Man Who Sold the World (Live &amp; Loud)\n13 School (Live &amp; Loud)\n14 Come As You Are (Live &amp; Loud)\n15 Lithium (Live &amp; Loud)\n16 About a Girl (Live &amp; Loud)\n17 Endless, Nameless (Live &amp; Loud)\n\nRelease Name: Nirvana-In_Utero_(20th_Anniversary_Super_Deluxe)_[Mastered_for_iTunes]-2013\nGenre: Rock, Alternative\nLabel: ? 2013 Geffen Records\nStore Date: Sep 24, 2013\nLink: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/in-utero-20th-anniversary/id686803869","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6a8900ebafa94c3f1f4a13004851f705e5fbb3c","amp;dn":"Nirvana-In_Utero_%2820th_Anniversary_Super_Deluxe%29_%5BMastered_for_i","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6a8900ebafa94c3f1f4a13004851f705e5fbb3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,168,144,14,186,250,148,195,241,244,161,48,4,133,31,112,94,95,187,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
