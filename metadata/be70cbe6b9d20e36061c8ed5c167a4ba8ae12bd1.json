KG\neISBN: 978-1-56990-524-1\nPrint ISBN: 978-1-56990-514-2\n\nThis introduction to polymer materials science is divided into three major sections: Basic Principles, Influence of Processing on Properties, and Engineering Design Properties. The first edition of this textbook was praised for its vast number of graphs and data that can be used as reference. The new second edition further strengthens this attribute with a new appendix containing material property graphs for the commonly used polymers. However, the most important change implemented in this edition is the introduction of real-world examples and a variety of problems at the end of each chapter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be70cbe6b9d20e36061c8ed5c167a4ba8ae12bd1","amp;dn":"Osswald%2C+Menges+-+Material+Science+of+Polymers+for+Engineers+3e","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be70cbe6b9d20e36061c8ed5c167a4ba8ae12bd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,112,203,230,185,210,14,54,6,28,142,213,193,103,164,186,138,225,43,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
