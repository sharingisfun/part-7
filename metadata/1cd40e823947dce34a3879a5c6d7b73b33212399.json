This concert marked the first time the pair have ever shared the bill for a major arena show. \n\nBoth guitarists have roots in the Yardbirds, a blues-tinged British band that also lists Led ZeppelinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Jimmy Page among its famous alumni. After the YardbirdsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ hit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFor Your Love,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Clapton exited the band in 1965 out of protest of the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s move from the blues to a new pop sound. ClaptonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s replacement, ironically enough, was Jeff Beck. \n\nOf course, Clapton and Beck went on to have pretty huge post-Yardbirds careers as well: Clapton as a member of Cream, Blind Faith, Derek &amp; The Dominoes and a successful solo career, while Beck fronted the Jeff Beck Group and also enjoyed a noteworthy solo run. And now, more than 40 years after the original Yardbirds disbanded, the two were finally together on stage in Japan.\n\nThe show consisted of 3 parts: Jeff Beck played first, then Eric played his set and finally Jeff Beck joined Eric. The show lasted about 2.5 hours - both Jeff and Eric played for about 1 hour then they played together for about 30 minutes.\n\nDisc 1: Jeff Beck &amp; his band main set\n01. The Pump\n02.
