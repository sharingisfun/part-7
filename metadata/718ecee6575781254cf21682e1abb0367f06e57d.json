Amazingly, the Bar-Kays not only regrouped but prospered, evolving into a popular funk ensemble over the course of the '70s. They continued to score hits on the R&amp;B charts through much of the '80s as well, making for a career longevity that no one would have predicted for Stax's formerly star-crossed number-two house band.\n\nThe Bar-Kays were formed in Memphis, TN, in 1966, growing out of a local group dubbed the Imperials. Modeled on classic Memphis soul instrumental outfits like the Mar-Keys and Booker T. &amp; the MG's, the Bar-Kays originally included guitarist Jimmy King (not the famed bluesman), trumpeter Ben Cauley, organist Ronnie Caldwell, saxophonist Phalon Jones, bassist James Alexander, and drummer Carl Cunningham. Adopting a mutated version of their favorite brand of rum (Bacardi) as their name, the band started playing heavily around Memphis, and eventually caught the attention of Stax/Volt, which signed the sextet in early 1967. With help from house drummer Al Jackson, Jr., the label began grooming the Bar-Kays as a second studio backing group that would spell Booker T. &amp; the MG's on occasion. That spring, the Bar-Kays cut their first single, &quot;Soul Finger,&quot; a playful, party-hearty instrumental punctuated by a group of neighborhood children shouting the title. &quot;Soul Finger&quot; reached the pop Top 20 and went all the way to number three on the R&amp;B chart, establishing the Bar-Kays in the public eye (although the follow-up, &quot;Give Everybody Some,&quot; barely scraped the R&amp;B Top 40). Producer Allen Jones began to take an interest in the group and became their manager and mentor; even better, Otis Redding chose them as his regular backing band that summer.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B/Funk\n\n\nThe Bar-Kays were an aggregate born of the same inspiration behind Booker T. &amp; the MG's -- performing the double-duty of being a backing combo for the significant canon of vocalists on the Memphis-based Stax and Volt labels, as well as a self-contained unit. The original lineup of James Alexander (bass), Jimmy King (guitar), Ronnie Caldwell (organ), Phalon Jones (sax), Carl Cunningham (drums), and Ben Cauley (trumpet) were only together long enough to have issued this album prior to the tragic loss of everyone sans Alexander and Cauley in the December '67 plane crash that also claimed the life of Otis Redding. Soul Finger (1967) commences with the title track, which quickly became a Top 20 crossover pop hit in addition to one of the band's best-known works, not to mention a certifiable 'feel good' party anthem. The remainder of the platter follows suit offering up ten further instrumentals that stay true to the precedent that had guided Booker T. &amp; the MG's , blending fun upbeat numbers with the occasional slower-tempo side complementing the otherwise teen-oriented and definitely danceable selections. Here, the cover of the Mad Lads' &quot;I Want Someone&quot; -- co-written by Stax co-founder Estelle Axton aptly fits the bill, with Caldwell providing a lovely and affective lead over the languid, melodic ballad. &quot;Theme From Hells Angels&quot; is interesting as there is no designation given to either the song's author or precisely what Hells Angels refers to. A movie? The infamous biker club? The staccato rhythm recalls Maurice Ravel's &quot;Bolero,&quot; while King's distinctly distorted fretwork helps to further the composition's undeniably dramatic quality. Another highlight is the &quot;Bar-Kays Boogaloo,&quot; while definitely a product of its time, it exemplifies the unit's cohesion as purveyors of the unmistakably swinging Stax/Volt sound. \n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Soul Finger\n02.Knucklehead\n03.With A Child's Heart\n04.Bar-Kay's Boogaloo\n05.Theme From Hell's Angels\n06.You Can't Sit Down\n07.House Shoes\n08.Pearl High\n09.I Want Someone\n10.Hole In The Wall\n11.Don't Do That\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:718ecee6575781254cf21682e1abb0367f06e57d","amp;dn":"Bar-Kays+-+Soul+Finger+%281992%29+mp3%40320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"718ecee6575781254cf21682e1abb0367f06e57d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,142,206,230,87,87,129,37,76,242,22,130,225,171,176,54,127,6,229,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
