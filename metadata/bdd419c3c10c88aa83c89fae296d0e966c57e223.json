What stops Dubai's super-tall skyscrapers - balanced on unstable sand - from toppling over? And how can San Francisco survive - sitting on the edge of a major earthquake fault? What lies beneath major metropolises is revealed when STRIP THE CITY peels back their buildings, roads, and rivers to explore the secret technology and infrastructure that keeps them running. This six-part original-Canadian series uses stunning CGI animation to go beneath Toronto, London, Rome, Dubai, Sydney, and San Francisco.\n\n\n1)  Ancient City Rome \nAt its zenith, 2,000 years ago Rome was the biggest city in the world. Today, it has survived better than any ancient city on earth and is home to three-million citizens. This episode strips the &quot;Eternal City's&quot; most famous icons bare to reveal the inner workings and the ingenious technology behind the Pantheon, Coliseum, Trevi Fountain, and Via Appia. Roman engineers' mastery of constructing buildings, roads, and viaducts set the city on course to become the greatest Empire the world had ever seen.\n\n2)  Earthquake City San Francisco \nSan Francisco is standing on the brink of disaster on top of one of the world's most infamous earthquake hotspots - the San Andreas Fault. How does the city's buildings and infrastructure survive the onslaught of a destructive earthquake? Engineers and geologists reveal the secrets inside San Francisco's skyscrapers, what protect\ns the city from raging fires, and what keep residents safe during the deadliest quakes.\n\n3)  Desert City Dubai \nDubai is a gleaming metropolis, grown from the desert sands in just a few decades - yet it sits in one of the driest places on Earth, is pummelled by raging sandstorms, and its skyscrapers are resting on top of sand. This episode looks beneath the city's skin to discover what keeps Dubai's buildings standing, protects them from desert storms, and keeps residents alive in the searing heat.\n\n4)  Harbour City Sydney \nSydney is home to a fifth Australia's entire population and is trapped between the Blue Mountains and the ocean, sitting on the driest inhabited continent on Earth, and surrounding one the planet's largest natural harbours. This episode uncovers what is inside Sydney's buildings and beneath its streets that allow the city to function - from the concealed contours of the harbour that allow super-sized ships to sail into the heart of the city, to the underground caverns that store its water.\n\n5)  Ice City Toronto \nHow did this metropolis grow to become the largest city in Canada in such an extreme environment? This film looks beneath the city's skin to discover the secret engineering wonders and geological forces that make it possible.\n\n6)  Underground City London \nWe lift up Buckingham Palace to reveal a 'lost' river and show the innovative engineering behind the city's brand new port under construction.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/5384/5skc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/5384/5skc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/3/3wp1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/3/3wp1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/9242/y67u.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/9242/y67u.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/3509/6r5q.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/3509/6r5q.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4663/e89q.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4663/e89q.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/5751/iale.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/5751/iale.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/5205/yfiv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/5205/yfiv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/img30/1902/yzsi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/img30/1902/yzsi.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/8872/pofj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/8872/pofj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/4477/fq5j.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/4477/fq5j.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/3332/nvx7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/3332/nvx7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/img15/4067/ki5l.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/img15/4067/ki5l.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: x264 ,AVC-1\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 384 kbps\nAudio Streams: 2.0\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 46 min\nNumber Of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 1.33 GB\nRipped by Hukumuzuku\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Hidden%20Worlds%20-%20Underground%20Rome&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Hidden%20Worlds%20-%20Underground%20Rome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Megacities&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Megacities&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Greatest%20Cities%20of%20the%20World%20Series1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Greatest%20Cities%20of%20the%20World%20Series1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3Ahukumuzuku&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3Ahukumuzuku&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Strip_the_City&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Strip_the_City&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdd419c3c10c88aa83c89fae296d0e966c57e223","amp;dn":"Discovery+Strip+the+City+5of6+Ice+City+Toronto+x264+720p+AC3+HDT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdd419c3c10c88aa83c89fae296d0e966c57e223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,212,25,195,193,12,136,170,131,200,159,174,41,109,14,150,108,87,226,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
