To this place of devious merchants, deceitful interpreters, and costly courtesans comes Jacob de Zoet, a devout young clerk who has five years in the East to earn a fortune of sufficient size to win the hand of his wealthy fiancÃƒÂ©e back in Holland. But JacobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original intentions are eclipsed after a chance encounter with Orito Aibagawa, the disfigured midwife to the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful magistrate. The borders between propriety, profit, and pleasure blur until Jacob finds his vision clouded, one rash promise made and then fatefully brokenÃ¢â‚¬â€the consequences of which will extend beyond JacobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worst imaginings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faaed3d27e365cf667ece5b6d7eacdc76b016c05","amp;dn":"David+Mitchell+-+The+Thousand+Autumns+of+Jacob+De+Zoet+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faaed3d27e365cf667ece5b6d7eacdc76b016c05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,174,211,210,126,54,92,246,103,236,229,182,215,234,205,199,107,1,108,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
