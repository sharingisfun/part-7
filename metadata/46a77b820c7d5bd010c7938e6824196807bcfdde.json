Her parents are environmental activists whose cringeworthy public protests might involve chaining themselves to a fence and pleading with passersby to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Save the World. Save Alice!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not that Alice doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work to be done. But after a petition to start a farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ market meets with more snickers than signatures, she figures she should shut up instead of speak out. At least, that is, until she can find something that feels real. Then along comes Whitney Lapin, a girl who speaks in cryptic riddles and spends her free time turning abandoned warehouses into beautiful gardens. Charismatic Whitney leads Alice on a rabbit trail into the undergroundÃ¢â‚¬â€a.k.a. secret societyÃ¢â‚¬â€of Wonderland High.\n\nCuriouser and curiouser. Alice is in wonderland! Even though WhitneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s group of teenage environmental vigilantes operates on the wrong side of the law, with them, Alice is finally free to be herself. She stomps on her good-girl image by completing a series of environmental pranks to impress the new group: flooding the school and disguising a pig as a baby in order to smuggle it out of a testing facility. She wants to trust them, and she especially wants to trust (or maybe kiss) Chester KatzÃ¢â‚¬â€a boy with a killer smile, a penchant for disappearing, and a secret that will really turn AliceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world backwards. But then one of the young vigilantes tries to frame Alice for all the pranks, and she must figure out their secret before she ends up in front of a jury thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s screaming, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Off with her head!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46a77b820c7d5bd010c7938e6824196807bcfdde","amp;dn":"Alice+in+Wonderland+High+-+Rachel+Shane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46a77b820c7d5bd010c7938e6824196807bcfdde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,167,123,130,12,125,91,208,16,199,147,142,104,36,25,104,7,188,253,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
