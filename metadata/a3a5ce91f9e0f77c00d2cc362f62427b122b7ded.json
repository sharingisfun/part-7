It covers the fundamental concepts and governing equations of different flows, and includes end of chapter exercises based on the practical applications. A number of useful tables on the thermodynamic properties of steam are also included.\n\nFundamentals of Gas Dynamics, Second Edition begins with an introduction to compressible and incompressible flows before covering the fundamentals of one dimensional flows and normal shock waves. Flows with heat addition and friction are then covered, and quasi one dimensional flows and oblique shock waves are discussed. Finally the prandtl meyer flow and the flow of steam through nozzles are considered.\n\nPublisher: Wiley; 2 edition (November 24, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1118973399\nISBN-13: 978-1118973394","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3a5ce91f9e0f77c00d2cc362f62427b122b7ded","amp;dn":"%5BVikash+Babu%5DFundamentals+of+Gas+Dynamics+%28AneAthena+Books%29%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3a5ce91f9e0f77c00d2cc362f62427b122b7ded","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,165,206,145,249,224,247,124,0,210,204,54,47,98,66,123,18,43,125,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
