Truman was a compromise candidate for vice president, almost an accidental president after Roosevelt's death 12 weeks into his second term. Truman's stunning come-from-behind victory in the 1948 election showed how his personal qualities of integrity and straightforwardness were appreciated by ordinary Americans, perhaps, as McCullough notes, because he was one himself. His presidency was dominated by enormously controversial issues: he dropped the atomic bomb on Japan, established anti-Communism as the bedrock of American foreign policy, and sent U.S. troops into the Korean War. In this winner of the 1993 Pulitzer Prize, McCullough argues that history has validated most of Truman's war-time and Cold War decisions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:501d2bbedf4d91fff5b8df1aeaad1b0197dd71e5","amp;dn":"David+McCullough+Truman+%28Pullitzer+Prize+Winner%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"501d2bbedf4d91fff5b8df1aeaad1b0197dd71e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,29,43,190,223,77,145,255,245,184,223,26,234,173,27,1,151,221,113,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
