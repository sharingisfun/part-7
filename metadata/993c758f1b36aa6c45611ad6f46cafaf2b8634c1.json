He is also known for his numerous associations with New World music and the use of African influences. He has also had other collaborations such as with Gary Moore, Hawkwind and Public Image.\nBaker's drumming attracted attention for its flamboyance, showmanship and pioneering use of two bass drums instead of the conventional single bass kick drum. As a firmly established rock drummer, he prefers being referred to as a jazz drummer.\n\nWhile at times performing in a similar way to Keith Moon from The Who, Baker also employs a more restrained style influenced by the British jazz groups he heard during the late 1950s and early 1960s. In his early days as a drummer, he performed lengthy drum solos, the best known being the thirteen-minute drum solo &quot;Toad&quot; from Cream's double album Wheels of Fire (1968). He is also noted for using a variety of other percussion instruments and for his application of African rhythms. He would often emphasize the flam, a drum rudiment where both sticks would attack the drums at almost the same time to give a heavy thunderous sound.\n\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks........!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:993c758f1b36aa6c45611ad6f46cafaf2b8634c1","amp;dn":"Ginger+Baker-album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"993c758f1b36aa6c45611ad6f46cafaf2b8634c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,60,117,143,27,54,170,108,69,97,26,214,244,108,175,175,43,134,52,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
