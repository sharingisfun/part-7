It was released in 1972 on Impulse! Records in quad. Personnel include Don Cherry and Charlie Haden. The final track has quite a bit of noise that sounds like loud tape hiss. I made no attempt at removing this noise since it's also present on the CD release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba316540fafbcc726fdb68311f2c16e2e06563ca","amp;dn":"Ornette+Coleman+-+Crisis+%281972+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossless+4.0+DVD-A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba316540fafbcc726fdb68311f2c16e2e06563ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,49,101,64,250,251,204,114,111,219,104,49,31,44,22,226,224,101,99,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
