UNFILTER can also apply a detected filter response to another signal, or export it to disk as an impulse response, and can even perform mastering grade adaptive, free-form, and graphic equalization.Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in music production, film post, game audio, broadcast, sound design, forensics, or engineering Ã¢â‚¬â€œ UNFILTER makes time-consuming and often impossible tasks as effortless as adjusting one control.\n\n\nThe UNFILTER features at a glance:\n\nAutomatically detect and remove resonances, equalization, roll-offs and the effects of comb filtering from musical, location, dialog and surveillance recordings.\nApply the measured filter response to other signals to place them in the same Ã¢â‚¬Å“acoustic worldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nExport the measured filter response to or import it from a linear- or minimum-phase impulse response file (WAV).\nMastering grade adaptive, free-form and graphic equalization.\nExtremely steep 96dB/octave shelving high-pass filter.\nOutput limiter for unsupervised use in batch processing applications.\nHighly time-efficient workflow and UI\nHomepage &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.zynaptiq.com/unfilter/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.zynaptiq.com/unfilter/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nUNVEIL is a real-time, de-mixing based plug-in that allows attenuating or boosting reverb components within a mixed signal of any channel count, including mono sources, as well as modifying reverb characteristics. Additionally, UNVEIL allows you to bring the key features of a recording into focus, or move them to the background, by attenuating or boosting perceptionally less important signal components.Based on our proprietary, artificial intelligence based MAP (Mixed-Signal Audio Processing) technology, UNVEIL allows fixing previously unusable location audio and dialog, tightening up live music recordings, removing reverb and Ã¢â‚¬Å“mudÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from musical signals, as well as creative sound design.\n\n\n\nUNVEIL has many uses, some of which are:\n\nAudio engineers can attenuate reverb in recordings\nFilm mixers and dialog editors can remove reverb from dialog and location sound\nMusic producers can turn vintage drum-loops rich in reverb into dry recordings, and vice-versa\nFoley artists can remove ambience from sub-optimally captured sounds\nMix and mastering engineers can bring key mix elements into focus by attenuating components commonly referred to as Ã¢â‚¬Å“mudÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nHomepage &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.zynaptiq.com/unveil/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.zynaptiq.com/unveil/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47b7478c82043b80212e7effbddb5b997eff2510","amp;dn":"ZYNAPTIQ+Plugin+Bundle+Win+MacOSX+%5BEx23%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47b7478c82043b80212e7effbddb5b997eff2510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,183,71,140,130,4,59,128,33,46,126,255,189,219,91,153,126,255,37,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
