Professor Dopp revisits music as the catalyst for dance, love and sex. From the music sheet to dance and through instruments, music is the expression of our profound desires and most violent passions. The text revisits the history of music and art from the dances of the first men to pop and electronic music and through belly dance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:479936463e0d753cd8c8e3ce09e28de1975e3411","amp;dn":"Music+and+Eros+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"479936463e0d753cd8c8e3ce09e28de1975e3411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,153,54,70,62,13,117,60,216,200,227,206,9,226,141,225,151,94,52,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
