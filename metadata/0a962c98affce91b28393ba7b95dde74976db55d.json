Here we'll concentrate more on using modeling tools and techniques to shape a seamless mesh, a molded weapons case in this instance.\n\nWe'll learn to add edge loops strategically and extrude geometry out from a surface. We'll learn to work symmetrically and learn to find and troubleshoot issues with the model. We'll also continue to repurpose polygons from our model to create new fitted pieces.\n\nThese courses are designed to be taken in sequence so we really encourage you to start with Volume 1 before continuing with this section.\n\nWe also encourage you to take advantage of the assignments that follow each volume. These assignments will allow you to take what you've learned and apply those tools and techniques to your own projects.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a962c98affce91b28393ba7b95dde74976db55d","amp;dn":"Quick+Start+to+Modeling+in+MODO%3A+Volume+2+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a962c98affce91b28393ba7b95dde74976db55d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,150,44,152,175,252,233,27,40,57,59,167,185,93,222,116,151,109,181,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
