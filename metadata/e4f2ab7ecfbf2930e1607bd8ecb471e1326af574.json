This incident has later been used for pilots in flight simulators, and almost none of them have succeeded in landing the plane safely.\n\nThe captain handled the situation with his previous experience flying sailplanes, and by remembering an old airfield that was no longer found on the maps.\n\nThis has been among my favourite films since I first recorded it from television in May 1997, and I was thrilled to learn that it was now available on DVD. However, picture quality on the DVD is not first-class with minor disturbances, but I made my best out of it.\n\nOriginal fullscreen, 624x464, AC3, good stereo sound.\nBurn tested, runs well in my DivX player.\n\nFormat/Info                  : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat/Family                : RIFF\nFile size                    : 700 MiB\nPlayTime                     : 1h 30mn\nBit rate                     : 1082 Kbps\nStreamSize                   : 7.56 MiB\n\nVideo #0\nCodec                        : XviD\nCodec/Family                 : MPEG-4V\nCodec/Info                   : XviD project\nCodec profile                : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\nCodec settings, Packet bitst : Yes\nCodec settings, BVOP         : Yes\nCodec settings, QPel         : No\nCodec settings, GMC          : 0\nCodec settings, Matrix       : Default\nPlayTime                     : 1h 30mn\nBit rate                     : 942 Kbps\nWidth                        : 624 pixels\nHeight                       : 464 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio         : 4/3\nFrame rate                   : 29.970 fps\nResolution                   : 8 bits\nChroma                       : 4:2:0\nInterlacement                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)           : 0.109\nStreamSize                   : 609 MiB\n\nAudio #0\nCodec                        : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nCodec profile                : Joint stereo\nPlayTime                     : 1h 30mn\nBit rate mode                : CBR\nBit rate                     : 128 Kbps\nMinimum bit rate             : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                   : 2 channels\nSampling rate                : 48 KHz\nResolution                   : 16 bits\nStreamSize                   : 82.8 MiB\nWriting library              : LAME3.97 \nEncoding settings            : CBR\n\nSource: NTSC Native\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4f2ab7ecfbf2930e1607bd8ecb471e1326af574","amp;dn":"Falling+from+the+Sky%3A+Flight+174+%281995%29%5BTrue+story%5D+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4f2ab7ecfbf2930e1607bd8ecb471e1326af574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,242,171,126,207,191,41,48,225,96,123,216,236,180,113,225,50,106,245,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
