Commercials are included as well as a few introductions from DJ's, however, none of the DJ's interfere with the songs as they are separate tracks. Talk stations are not included unfortunately.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City_Official_Soundtrack_Box_Set\r\n\r\n\r\nEncoding Notes: This was ripped by me, BeerKey, using iTunes with the encoder set to Apple Lossless. Everything should be properly tagged. I may do FLAC in the future (if I get enough requests) using something like EAC but I was having trouble with the app.\r\n\r\nThanks are very much appreciated and please help seed if you enjoy this","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cd071f7e31ecf1b97dae2d2b8b1a59d9fb8d839","amp;dn":"GTA%3A+Vice+City+Soundtrack+%28Box+Set%29+%5BALAC%5D+%7EBeerKey%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cd071f7e31ecf1b97dae2d2b8b1a59d9fb8d839","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,208,113,247,227,30,207,27,151,218,226,210,184,177,165,157,159,184,216,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
