If you were in grade school during that time, some key events might have made a very big impression on your innocence. Ed Sullivan bellowed, &quot;Now something for the youngsters Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ The Beatles!&quot; The Space Age brought you the Man on the Moon and the assassinations of the Kennedys and King. The Vietnam War was on TV every night. Peace and equality was the mantra of the times - but the establishment was pressing their boot on the neck of a movement primed to change the world as we knew it. All the things you loved about our world, you also wanted to hate. All we are saying is give peace a chance and we shall overcome, but the body count is piling up. It's your fault. It's my fault. It's our fault. It is a coming of age. LeE HaRVEY OsMOND is the eyeball and the ear of Tom Wilson, who grew up during this time in Hamilton, Ontario, a blue-collar steel town. &quot;The Folk Sinner&quot; is the title of the new album made from society's transgressions, as seen and heard by LeE HARVey OsMOND, who once wrote that he is in love with the system that keeps him down.\n\nTom Wilson (guitar and vocals) struck Canadian rock gold in the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s as the leader of the much-loved Junkhouse, and then found a whole new audience as a crucial component of roots-rock super-group Blackie and the Rodeo Kings, who have enjoyed recent success with their album KINGS and QUEENS, a collaboration with some of the finest female artists in the field of Americana and Roots Music. Wilson released solo albums in 2001 and 2006, and his 2005 collaboration with Bob Lanois, The Shack Recordings, was critically acclaimed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6a87126f7f54204b39d7224b66c67b847cd5879","amp;dn":"Lee+Harvey+Osmond+-+The+Folk+Sinner+%5B2013%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6a87126f7f54204b39d7224b66c67b847cd5879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,168,113,38,247,245,66,4,179,157,114,36,182,108,103,184,71,205,88,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
