It brings with it many recognisable traits of that genre, both good and bad.\n\nThe story centres on a high-powered female lawyer played - for the most part convincingly - by Tilda Swinton. The themes dealt with as the film unfolds are control, sexual desire, self-doubt, sibling relationship and self-destruction.\nIncidental to this is the main character's open bisexuality.\n\nAs with many an art house film the plot is thin, though there is a unifying thread. The first half of the film has enough content to keep the viewer interested, but as the mood darkens the piece slows down. Expect something with the pace of say, Paris Texas, and you will not be disappointed.\n\nCinematography and locations are at times stunning though inconsistent. Performances are strong but the director often creates a self consciously arty atmosphere that can alienate the less forgiving viewer.\n\nOne jarring note was a rather amateur technical side. We are treated - incredibly -to an ever-present boom microphone visibly hovering above the characters heads, or reflected off shiny surfaces. The director Susan Streitfeld should hang her head in shame! The visual rendition on DVD is sumptuous though, albeit in 4:3 ratio.\n\nThat aside, this film is worth a look, if only for some of the stunning camera work. And it will get you thinking, unlike most Hollywood offerings. Students of film and cinematography buffs may especially gain something from it. Don't take my word - make up your own mind.   \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img220.imageshack.us/img220/8468/femaleperversionspart11bi2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img220.imageshack.us/img220/8468/femaleperversionspart11bi2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img220.imageshack.us/img220/7387/femaleperversionspart12vx1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img220.imageshack.us/img220/7387/femaleperversionspart12vx1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img134.imageshack.us/img134/6184/femaleperversionspart13gf7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img134.imageshack.us/img134/6184/femaleperversionspart13gf7.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img134.imageshack.us/img134/9692/femaleperversionspart22th1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img134.imageshack.us/img134/9692/femaleperversionspart22th1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----not my rip-------                              \n                                                               \n~~~~~~ Female Perversions.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,464,422,400                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................DivX 5.2.1 (WaffleDay)              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:44:13                \nFrame Count:....................................156309             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................608                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................448                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.357                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1739                 \n......MPEG-4..............................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.255&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................121                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
