He was very young when he first hel the guitar.  At six years old he knew how to play the Compas ( the art of rhytmical measure ) and very soon he became the finest guitarist among the young gypsies of the region.  At fifteen he played the Festivals of Les Saintes Maries de la Mer where his great uncle, JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Reyes - an idolised gypsy singer - predicted a great future for Tonino.  A few years later he met JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s sons and joined them as the solo guitarist in their band &quot;Los Reyes&quot;.  Later they where to change the name of the band to &quot;Gypsy Kings&quot; and embrace their legendary career.  Filled with admiration for Paco de Lucia, of whom he is a disciple, Tonino's style became more open, favouring melody and emotion.  With his wide range of compositions and perfect lyrical content.  Tonino now stands out in the international Flamenco style of playing, baring his soul and preserving the &quot;duende&quot; ( the art of bewitching ).  Today Tonino expresses himself solely with the only thing that allows him to convey to us his most secret and imposing emotions...his guitar. - from the CD cover\n\nOne can only summize Baliardo's techniques as expressive and yes, universal...none of this guess work of who is playing this fantastic mood flamengo setting, from the very first chords, you're hooked...you're enrolled immediately to the &quot;Tonino Baliardo Fan Club&quot;, and you want more of the same...justification can only be the term used for the title and the following tracks of this outstanding collection...played over and over everyday on the easy listening, smooth jazz and classical radio stations...distinctive style is immediately recognizable...a mix of classical and of course flamenco...highly acceptable in all parts of the continent and world.  But several highlights come to mind - &quot;Rumba Caliente&quot;...&quot;Caravan Road&quot;...but my personal favorite hands down is - &quot;Redemption&quot;, passion flows like red wine, only to leave you completely mesmirized by haunting refrains, gets under your skin and stays there for days, trust me! ~ J.
