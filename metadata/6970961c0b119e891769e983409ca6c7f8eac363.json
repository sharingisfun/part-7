On john pizzarelli&amp;#039;s John Pizzarelli Meets the Beatles (RCA Victor), a well-conceived tribute that sets the duo&amp;#039;s classics in jazz-trio and big-band arrangements, the singer/guitarist hits the mark most often when taking on McCartney&amp;#039;s tunes. He approaches &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Buy Me Love,&quot; &quot;When I&amp;#039;m 64,&quot; and &quot;Get Back&quot; with a playful wink, jumping off his speedy melody lines and the rising brass sections for extended improvisational tradeoffs with pianist Ray Kennedy. Pizzarelli adds colorful touches like scatting and even ad-libs his own lyrical verses based on the originals. Likewise, he treats an instrumental version of &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; with an aggressive sense of swing. And his intense vocal on a percussive &quot;Oh, Darling&quot; helps the tune rise above mere cover-band fare. However, when Pizzarelli presents ballads like &quot;You&amp;#039;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; and &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; with maudlin arrangements, he pretty well grinds the party to a halt.\n\nTracklist:\n1.
