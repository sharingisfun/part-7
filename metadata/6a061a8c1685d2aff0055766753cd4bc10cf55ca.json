The change prompted criticism from some influential figures in the folk community Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sing Out! editor Irwin Silber complained that Dylan had &quot;somehow lost touch with people&quot; and was caught up in &quot;the paraphernalia of fame&quot;.\n\nDespite the album's thematic shift, Dylan performed the entirety of Another Side of Bob Dylan as he had previous records Ã¢â‚¬â€œ solo. In addition to his usual acoustic guitar and harmonica, Dylan provides piano on one selection, &quot;Black Crow Blues&quot;. Another Side of Bob Dylan reached No. 43 in the US (although it eventually went gold), and peaked at No. 8 on the UK charts in 1965.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nAll songs written by Bob Dylan.\n\n    &quot;All I Really Want to Do&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:04\n    &quot;Black Crow Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:14\n    &quot;Spanish Harlem Incident&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:24\n    &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:10\n    &quot;I Shall Be Free No. 10&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:47\n    &quot;To Ramona&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:52\n    &quot;Motorpsycho Nitemare&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:33\n    &quot;My Back Pages&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:22\n    &quot;I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:22\n    &quot;Ballad in Plain D&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:16\n    &quot;It Ain't Me Babe&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:33","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a061a8c1685d2aff0055766753cd4bc10cf55ca","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Another+Side+Of+Bob+Dylan+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a061a8c1685d2aff0055766753cd4bc10cf55ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,6,26,140,22,133,210,175,240,5,87,102,117,60,212,188,16,207,85,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
