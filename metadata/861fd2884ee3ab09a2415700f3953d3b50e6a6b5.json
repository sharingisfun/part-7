Other members of the sextet were Robert Buck (guitar), Steven Gustafson (bass), Dennis Drew (keyboards), and Jerry Augustyniak (drums). The group gigged extensively and recorded independently before signing with Elektra and making The Wishing Chair in 1985. Co-founder Lombardo left the band in 1986, and they continued as a quintet, releasing their second album, In My Tribe, in 1987. This album broke into the charts, where it stayed 77 weeks, peaking at number 37. Blind Man's Zoo, the 1989 follow-up, hit number 13 and went gold. \n\n\nGenre................: Irish Folk\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Lossless Audiochecker, Accurip Log, Cue\n\n\n\n01.Lady Mary Ramsey\n02.The Song Of Wandering Aengus\n03.She Moved Through The Fair\n04.Dark Eyed Sailor\n05.Misty Moisty Morning\n06.Bonny May\n07.Canadee-I-O\n08.Do You Love An Apple\n09.Greenwood Sidey\n10.Carrickfergus\n11.Death Of Queen Jane\n12.Wild Mountain Thyme\n13.Marie's Wedding\n14.Lady Mary Ramsay II\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:861fd2884ee3ab09a2415700f3953d3b50e6a6b5","amp;dn":"10%2C000+Maniacs+-+Twice+Told+Tales+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"861fd2884ee3ab09a2415700f3953d3b50e6a6b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,31,210,136,78,227,171,9,162,65,87,0,243,149,61,59,80,230,166,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
