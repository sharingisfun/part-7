This was one of my first Coursera batch-downloads, so please excuse the mess.\n\n######################################################\n\nThis course is all about you ... your mind, your behavior, and what underlies them both. It will be a fast paced tour of the most important experiments in psychology, one that is intended to fascinate, inform, and provoke deep thought. Come learn about yourself with us!\n\nThis course will highlight the most interesting experiments within the field of psychology, discussing the implications of those studies for our understanding of the human mind and human behavior.  We will explore the brain and some of the cognitive abilities it supports like memory, learning, attention, perception and consciousness.  We will examine human development - both in terms of growing up and growing old - and will discuss the manner in which the behavior of others affect our own thoughts and behavior.  Finally we will discuss various forms of mental illness and the treatments that are used to help those who suffer from them.  \n\nThe fact of the matter is that humans routinely do amazing things without appreciating how interesting they are.  However, we are also routinely influenced by people and events without always being aware of those influences.  By the end of this course you will have gained a much better understanding and appreciation of who you are and how you work.  And I can guarantee you that you'll learn things that you'll be telling your friends and family about, things that will fundamentally change the way you think of yourself and others.  How can you resist that?!\n\nMore information about this course available at https://www.coursera.org/course/intropsych","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51857dd64367c0755dcc21c49bb453b72a537dc9","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Introduction+to+Psychology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51857dd64367c0755dcc21c49bb453b72a537dc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,133,125,214,67,103,192,117,93,204,33,196,155,180,83,183,42,83,125,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
