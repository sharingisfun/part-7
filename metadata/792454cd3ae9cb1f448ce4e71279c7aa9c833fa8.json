He dreamed of moving to America to become a bodybuilding champion and a movie star.\nBy the age of twenty-one, he was living in Los Angeles and had been crowned Mr. Universe.\nWithin five years, he had learned English and become the greatest bodybuilder in the world.\nWithin ten years, he had earned his college degree and was a millionaire from his business enterprises in real estate, landscaping, and bodybuilding. He was also the winner of a Golden Globe Award for his debut as a dramatic actor in Stay Hungry.\nWithin twenty years, he was the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest movie star, the husband of Maria Shriver, and an emerging Republican leader who was part of the Kennedy family.\nThirty-six years after coming to America, the man once known by fellow bodybuilders as the Austrian Oak was elected governor of California, the seventh largest economy in the world.\nHe led the state through a budget crisis, natural disasters, and political turmoil, working across party lines for a better environment, election reforms, and bipartisan solutions.\nWith Maria Shriver, he raised four fantastic children. In the wake of a scandal he brought upon himself, he tried to keep his family together.\nUntil now, he has never told the full story of his life, in his own voice.\nHere is Arnold, with total recall.\n\nCONTENTS\nCHAPTER 1 Out of Austria\nCHAPTER 2 Building a Body\nCHAPTER 3 Confessions of a Tank Driver\nCHAPTER 4 Mr. Universe\nCHAPTER s Greetings from Los Angeles\nCHAPTER 6 Lazy Bastards\nCHAPTER 7 Experts in Marble and Stone\nCHAPTER 8 Learning American\nCHAPTER 9 The Greatest Muscle Show Ever\nCHAPTER 1o Stay Hungry\nCHAPTER 1I Pumping Iron\nCHAPTER 12 Dream Girl\nCHAPTER 13 Maria and Me\nCHAPTER 14 What Doesn't Kill Us Makes Us Stronger\nCHAPTER 15 Becoming American\nCHAPTER 16 The Terminator\nCHAPTER t1 Marriage and Movies\nCHAPTER 18 Comic Timing\nCHAPTER 19 The Real Life of a Terminator\nCHAPTER 20 The Last Action Hero\nCHAPTER 21 Heart Trouble\nCHAPTER 22 Family Guy\nCHAPTER 23 A Political Proposition\nCHAPTER 24 Total Recall\nCHAPTER 25 The Governator\nCHAPTER 26 Comeback\nCHAPTER 27 Who Needs Washington?\nCHAPTER 28 The Real Life of a Governator\nCHAPTER 29 The Secret\nCHAPTER 30 Arnold's Rules","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:792454cd3ae9cb1f448ce4e71279c7aa9c833fa8","amp;dn":"Total+Recall+-+My+Unbelievably+True+Life+Story+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"792454cd3ae9cb1f448ce4e71279c7aa9c833fa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,36,84,205,58,233,203,31,68,140,228,231,18,121,199,170,156,131,63,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
