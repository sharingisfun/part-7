Society is governed and conflicts are resolved in the arena of a fantasy computer game, Epic. Everyone plays. If you win, you have the chance to go to university, get more supplies for your community, and fulfill your dreams; if you lose, your life both in and out of the game is worth nothing.\nWhen Erik, seeking revenge for the unjust treatment of his parents, dares to subvert the rules of Epic, he and his friends find themselves up against with the ultimate masters of the game: the Committee. If Erik and his friends win, they may have the key to destroying Epic's tyranny over New Earth. But if they lose . . .\n\n\nSAGA\nThe breathtaking sequel to the multistarred Epic! Ghost is part of a street hacker airboard gang who lives to break rules. When they realize that their worldÃ¢â‚¬â€SagaÃ¢â‚¬â€is being periodically invaded by strange human beings, they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what to do. That is, until they learn the complicated truth: Saga is not just their world. It is a sentient computer game, the replacement to Epic on New Earth, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s addictive. The Dark Queen who controls Saga is trying to enslave both its people and the people of New Earth. And sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll succeed unless Ghost and her friendsÃ¢â‚¬â€and Erik, from Epic, and his friendsÃ¢â‚¬â€figure out what to do.\n\n\nEDDA\nEveryone in the virtual universe of Edda is made of pixels-except Penelope. While her body is kept alive in a hospital bed, her avatar runs free, able to go anywhere and do anything, including create deadly weapons for Edda's ruler, her guardian, Lord Scanthax. When Scanthax decides he wants to invade another virtual world, Erik/Cindella from Epic and Ghost from &quot;Saga&quot; become part of the story-and soon the virtual universes are alive with fighting, alight with bombs, and brought together by three teenagers who want peace and understanding. This is the third and final book in Conor Kostick's trilogy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5e0e80c148273e0b2d2f19e6be090ccb2f86dc6","amp;dn":"The+Epic+Trilogy+by+Conor+Kostick","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5e0e80c148273e0b2d2f19e6be090ccb2f86dc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,224,232,12,20,130,115,224,178,210,241,158,107,224,144,204,178,248,109,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
