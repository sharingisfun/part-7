Although what you find there is in no way pleasing! The population is being terrorized by a reckless army; in the meantime the main export goods are drugs. Subversion and fraudulence has infiltrated all levels of local government and the ever-present Mafia has his fingers in many pies.\n\nYou are working undercover on behalf of the US government and your goal is to destroy the mighty drug cartel. You'll need a skilled hand to put together the right team of mercenaries, the negotiating skills of a diplomat to get the sceptical population onto your side. More importantly, you must have the strategic genius of a general and the fighting tactics of a guerrilla.\n\nShould you fail, your &quot;client&quot; will deny all knowledge of your existence.\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST:\n\nFAR CRYÃ¢â€Â¬Ã‚Â«\n\nFAR CRYÃ¢â€Â¬Ã‚Â« 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\n\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\n\t\t\nGOTHIC 1, 2, 3\n\nIN COLD BLOOD\n\nLEISURE SUIT LARRY LANGUAGE PACK (might not have it)\n\nDONT STARVE (could take awhile to get it)\n\nKING OF DRAGON PASS\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f18ae95ec1824820a1c99e7b8437c6ee3a703bbf","amp;dn":"Jagged+Alliance+2+-+Wildfire+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f18ae95ec1824820a1c99e7b8437c6ee3a703bbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,138,233,94,193,130,72,32,161,201,158,123,132,55,198,238,58,112,59,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
