These trains were a vital cog in the military machine from carrying troops, to moving hospitals, to being transformed into actual weapons. In this compelling series we tell the stories of these incredible trains...\r\nWe combine expert interviews, authentic reconstruction, engineering graphics and archive, highlighting the extraordinary human stories alongside the engineering detail and military perspective. The stories are dramatic, exciting and filled with fascinating historical detail. Each of these incredible stories is set against a backdrop of conflict and we put the events into context. In addition to the stories of the trains we learn more about the military, political and domestic battles happening at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5)  Precious Cargo \r\nFour railway journeys that changed modern history: 24 year-old Winston Churchill boarded an armoured train during the Boer War hoping for a newspaper scoop. He was captured, but became world famous after escaping. In 1917 Lenin crossed Europe in a sealed train, aided by the Germans who hoped that he would drag Russia out of the war. The infamous Hungarian Gold Train that contained plundered Jewish jewellery and gold was an exercise in naked greed at the end of the Second World War, whilst the Kindertransport saved almost 10,000 Jewish children from certain death. John Fieldsend and Dame Stephanie Shirley give a moving account of their journeys.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/99/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3c/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/28/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/82/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/38/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8b/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 1666 Kbps\r\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 8\r\n * Part Size: 518 MB\r\n * Source: PDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.historychannel.com.au/tv-shows/1918/combat-trains-the-death-railway","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bff73e1c2af24aa817974a554a603df88f688cc","amp;dn":"Combat+Trains+5of8+Precious+Cargo+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bff73e1c2af24aa817974a554a603df88f688cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,255,115,225,194,175,36,170,129,121,116,165,84,166,3,223,136,246,136,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
