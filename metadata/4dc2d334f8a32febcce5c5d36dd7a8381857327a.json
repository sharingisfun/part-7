Create an emergency startup partition on the active system volume using TechTool Pro's eDrive, without ever having to boot from a DVD. Perform a SMART test on your internal ATA or SATA drives to detect changes in reliability, and repair corrupt or damaged HFS+ volumes, including those in newer solid-state devices (SSD's).\n\nUse TechTool Pro's Volume Cloning to create exact duplicates of your volumes for trouble-free archiving. Plus, TechTool Pro helps you recover deleted files and lost data. If bad blocks are found when scanning your hard drive, you can identify and restore the corrupted files within them from previous backups you have archived.\n\nTo help keep your Mac running at peak performance, use TechTool Pro to optimize your volumes after defragmenting your files, or to repair disk permissions which may prevent problems accessing applications or files on your Mac.\n\nTechTool Pro also helps with device management within your local area network (LAN).
