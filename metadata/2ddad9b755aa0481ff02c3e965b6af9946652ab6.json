This is not a Dave Matthews Band concert, but rather Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds only, playing acoustic. Tim isn't an official member of DMB, but does have a long history of collaboration with Dave and is no stranger to DMB fans. I cranked the audio bit rate up to 320kbps since the audio is even more important for concerts than it is for movies (at least in my opinion) so there should be no issues whatsoever with audio quality. \n\nBitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.\n\nPlease seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ddad9b755aa0481ff02c3e965b6af9946652ab6","amp;dn":"Dave+Matthews+and+Tim+Reynolds+Live+at+Radio+City+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ddad9b755aa0481ff02c3e965b6af9946652ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,218,217,183,85,170,4,129,255,2,195,233,101,182,175,153,70,101,42,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
