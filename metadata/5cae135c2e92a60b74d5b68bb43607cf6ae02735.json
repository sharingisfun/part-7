Steve BerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new international adventure blends gripping contemporary political intrigue, Tudor treachery, and high-octane thrills into one riveting novel of suspense.\n \nCotton Malone and his fifteen-year-old son, Gary, are headed to Europe. As a favor to his former boss at the Justice Department, Malone agrees to escort a teenage fugitive back to England. But after he is greeted at gunpoint in London, both the fugitive and Gary disappear, and Malone learns that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stumbled into a high-stakes diplomatic showdownÃ¢â‚¬â€an international incident fueled by geopolitical gamesmanship and shocking Tudor secrets.\n \nAt its heart is the Libyan terrorist convicted of bombing Pan Am Flight 103, who is set to be released by Scottish authorities for Ã¢â‚¬Å“humanitarian reasons.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ An outraged American government objects, but nothing can persuade the British to intervene.\n \nExcept, perhaps, Operation KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Deception.\n \nRun by the CIA, the operation aims to solve a centuries-old mystery, one that could rock Great Britain to its royal foundations.\n \nBlake Antrim, the CIA operative in charge of KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Deception, is hunting for the spark that could rekindle a most dangerous fire, the one thing that every Irish national has sought for generations: a legal reason why the English must leave Northern Ireland. The answer is a long-buried secret that calls into question the legitimacy of the entire forty-five-year reign of Elizabeth I, the last Tudor monarch, who completed the conquest of Ireland and seized much of its land. But Antrim also has a more personal agenda, a twisted game of revenge in which Gary is a pawn. With assassins, traitors, spies, and dangerous disciples of a secret society closing in, Malone is caught in a lethal bind. To save Gary he must play one treacherous player against anotherÃ¢â‚¬â€and only by uncovering the incredible truth can he hope to prevent the shattering consequences of the KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Deception.\n\nSeries: Cotton Malone\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Random House Audio; Abridged edition (June 11, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0449008983\nISBN-13: 978-0449008980\nWritten by Steve Berry \nRead by Scott Brick \nFormat: MP3 \nBitrate: 56 Kbps \nUnabridged\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
