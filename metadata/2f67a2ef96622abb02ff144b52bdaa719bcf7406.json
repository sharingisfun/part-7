Jack and his fourth wife, Babette, bound by their love, fear of death, and four ultramodern offspring, navigate the rocky passages of family life to the background babble of brand-name consumerism. Then a lethal black chemical cloud, unleashed by an industrial accident, floats over there lives, an &quot;airborne toxic event&quot; that is a more urgent and visible version of the white noise engulfing the GladneysÃ¢â‚¬â€the radio transmissions, sirens, microwaves, and TV murmurings that constitute the music of American magic and dread.\n\n\nBetter than any book I can think of, White Noise captures the particular strangeness of life in a time where humankind has finally learned enough to kill itself. Naturally, it's a terribly funny book, and the prose is as beautiful as a sunset through a particulate-filled sky. Nice-guy narrator Jack Gladney teaches Hitler Studies at a small college. His wife may be taking a drug that removes fear, and one day a nearby chemical plant accidentally releases a cloud of gas that may be poisonous. Writing before Bhopal and Prozac entered the popular lexicon, DeLillo produced a work so closely tuned into its time that it tells the future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f67a2ef96622abb02ff144b52bdaa719bcf7406","amp;dn":"White+Noise+by+Don+DeLillo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f67a2ef96622abb02ff144b52bdaa719bcf7406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,103,162,239,150,98,42,187,2,255,20,75,82,189,170,113,155,207,116,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
