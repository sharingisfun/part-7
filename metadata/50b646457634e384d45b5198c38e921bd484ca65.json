Every time that you click on that you will instantly gain 128 shadow-cores.. You can click it as much as you desire.. The only problem is that the shadow-core display doesn't update instantly, so you have to go to other screens/places to see the updated amount.. But each time you click the button, it really is adding shadow-cores every time you hear that clicking sound..\nIf you don't want to cheat, then don't click that button..\n\n\nThe official change-log from version 1.0.15 is as follows:\n\n&gt; 'Calling waves early' tutorial text made more clear\n&gt; 'Sigil' achievement made easier\n&gt; Journey notes screen: pages can be turned by clicking on them\n&gt; Gems in towers shouldn't fire at dying spires anymore + spire selection highlight is dropped when the spire starts to collapse\n&gt; The info panel doesn't cover the mana bar (min y set to 58 instead of 10 when in battle)\n&gt; Fixed: selecting a building made all gems outside range trying to attack buildings, same with creatures\n&gt; Fixed again: Gem enchantment shrines accept dragged bombs only\n&gt; Some typos fixed\n\n\nAny way, have fun with this cracked gemcraft.. It will be years before the next gemcraft is released..\n\nLove and light,\nsigned your most bestest friend that you never had because you were too scared to talk to me when we passed by each other in real life that one day,\nokonomiyaki","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50b646457634e384d45b5198c38e921bd484ca65","amp;dn":"Gemcraft+2+Chasing+Shadows+v1.0.15+Cracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50b646457634e384d45b5198c38e921bd484ca65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,182,70,69,118,52,227,132,212,91,81,152,195,142,146,27,212,132,202,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
