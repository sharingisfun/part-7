Author Paul F. Aubin guides designers into thinking both in and out of the box, through discovering and applying industry standard best practices, employing creative and sometimes unconventional techniques and procedures, and finding ways to make models serve multiple concurrent project goals. \n\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n Understanding some different approaches to modeling\n Building an in-place mass\n Creating and manipulating massing forms\n Using X-Ray and Dissolve\n Performing an energy analysis\n Applying geometry to surfaces\n Configuring divided surfaces\n Nesting massing families\n Stitching borders with adaptive components\n Working with lofting techniques\n Adding dormers and soffits\n Choosing a wall modeling strategy\n Working with curtain walls\n Building custom stairs\n Creating a custom material\n\n\nvisit me on facebook -  Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:442827fb84efa34cdf418e243b73b374ed638ab0","amp;dn":"Advanced+Modeling+in+Revit+Architecture-Lynda.com%5BTeam+Nanban%5Dtm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"442827fb84efa34cdf418e243b73b374ed638ab0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,40,39,251,132,239,163,76,223,65,142,36,59,115,179,116,237,99,138,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
