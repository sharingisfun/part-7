Thornton and Andrew Rex\nBrooks Cole | January 2012 | ISBN-10: 1133103723 | PDF | 688 pages | 13.2 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Physics-Scientists-Engineers-Stephen-Thornton/dp/1133103723&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Physics-Scientists-Engineers-Stephen-Thornton/dp/1133103723&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLearn about the latest discoveries in physics with MODERN PHYSICS. This book offers a contemporary and comprehensive approach to physics with a strong emphasis on applications to help you see how concepts in the book relate to the real world. Discussions on the experiments that led to certain key discoveries illustrate the process behind scientific advances and give you a historical perspective. The book also provides a solid foundation in quantum theory to help you understand more advanced physics concepts.\n\nAbout the Author\nStephen Thornton is Professor of Physics at the University of Virginia. He has over 120 research publications in experimental nuclear physics and served as the initial Director of the Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics. He has been a Fulbright fellow (twice) and a Max Planck fellow to do research in Germany.\nIn recent years he has become more involved in physics and science education, having served as Chair of AAPT's Committee on Science Education for the Public and as President of the Virginia Association of Science Teachers. He has developed distance learning physics and physical science courses for K-12 teachers and taught courses and workshops for thousands of K-12 teachers, including many websites with hands-on activities. He has revitalized the lab/workshop taken by engineering students. He is the author of three physics textbooks, including CLASSICAL DYNAMICS with Jerry Marion and MODERN PHYSICS with Andrew Rex, both published by Thomson - Brooks/Cole.\n\nUse Foxit reader to read this book if you have problems opening it with Adobe reader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95a9f67ad389bc7a909b84f6e7d32bc015230f48","amp;dn":"Modern+Physics+for+Scientists+and+Engineers+%284th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95a9f67ad389bc7a909b84f6e7d32bc015230f48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,169,246,122,211,137,188,122,144,155,132,246,231,211,43,192,21,35,15,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
