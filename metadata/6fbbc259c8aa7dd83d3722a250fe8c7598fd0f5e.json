We&amp;#039;ll see how German intelligence proved a formidable foe, and how in the end it was totally compromised from its center.  \n\nThis program provides an overview of German espionage from 1870 to 1945. The origins and development of the secret &amp;#039;services&amp;#039; which Germany used to collect intelligence and to counter the activities of other countries are discussed. There are famous spies and unknown operatives involved in the dangerous and mundane activities of the professional &quot;spy&quot;. A useful contrast to the fabulous world of Hollywood spies and secret agents, this documentary explores the unglamorous but nonetheless dangerous world of the espionage agent.\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: History.Channel.Great.Spy.Stories.Hitlers.Spies.PDTV.XViD-SomeTV.avi\nFilesize.....: 350 MB (or 358,406 KB or 367,007,744 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:44:53 (67,326 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 972 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 110 kb/s (55/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.90.\u0002Ã‚Â°\nFrame Size...: 512x384 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\nLanguage.....: English\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ned2k://|file|History.Channel.Great.Spy.Stories.Hitlers.Spies.PDTV.XViD-SomeTV.avi|367007744|21DCE92712373E0382A82136EFDD1CFC|/\n\n\n\nthanks eztv for the torrent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fbbc259c8aa7dd83d3722a250fe8c7598fd0f5e","amp;dn":"History+Channel+Great+Spy+Stories+Hitlers+Spies+PDTV+XViD+SomeTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fbbc259c8aa7dd83d3722a250fe8c7598fd0f5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,187,194,89,200,170,125,216,61,55,34,162,80,254,140,117,152,253,15,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
