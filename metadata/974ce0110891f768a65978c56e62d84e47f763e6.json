The recording of these two masterpieces is among the most beloved in all of recording history. The warm, romantic sound of the Guarneri Quartet at the height of their careers is here coupled with one of the towering giants of pianism in the 20th century, Artur Rubinstein!! This is one CD you will listen to over and over. Both of these works are infectiously beautiful, but merit repeated listening. The mastery of the counterpoint and the interplay between the piano and the strings, the seemingly bottomless well of rich melodic ideas and melodic development, the idiomatic knowledge of all the instruments -- Schumann and Brahmns were both at the top of their game here. You will enjoy this disk for years to come, and hopefully will continue your appreciation of chamber music. I'd recommend that your next purchase would be of the Brahms piano quartets, and then . . .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:974ce0110891f768a65978c56e62d84e47f763e6","amp;dn":"Brahms+and+Schumann+Piano+Quintets+Rubinstein+Guarneri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"974ce0110891f768a65978c56e62d84e47f763e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,76,224,17,8,145,247,104,166,89,120,197,110,98,216,78,71,247,99,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
