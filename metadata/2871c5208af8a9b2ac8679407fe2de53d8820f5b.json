It continued its predecessors' tendencies toward blues, rockabilly and pre-rock balladry, and was self-produced by Dylan under the pseudonym &quot;Jack Frost&quot;. Along with the acclaim, the album sparked some debate over its uncredited use of choruses and arrangements from older songs, as well as many lyrical lines taken from the work of 19th century poet Henry Timrod.\n\nModern Times became the singer-songwriter's first #1 album in the U.S. since 1976's Desire. It was also his first album to debut at the summit of the Billboard 200, selling 191,933 copies in its first week. At age 65, Dylan became the oldest living person at the time to have an album\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Thunder on the mountain                              [05:55]\n02.Spirit on the water                                  [07:43]\n03.Rollin' and tumblin'                                 [06:02]\n04.When the deal goes down                              [05:04]\n05.Someday baby                                         [04:56]\n06.Workingman's blues #2                                [06:07]\n07.Beyond the horizon                                   [05:36]\n08.Nettie moore                                         [06:53]\n09.The levee's gonna break                              [05:43]\n10.Ain't talkin'                                        [08:48]\n____\n\n62:47 min\n 91,2 MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2871c5208af8a9b2ac8679407fe2de53d8820f5b","amp;dn":"Bob_Dylan-Modern_Times-%28Retail%29-2006-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2871c5208af8a9b2ac8679407fe2de53d8820f5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,113,197,32,138,248,169,178,172,134,121,64,127,226,222,83,216,130,15,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
