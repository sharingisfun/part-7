Rembrandt's Eyes is, in fact, two biographies for the price of one. From the outset, Schama contrasts the life of Rembrandt with that of his older, equally talented countryman Peter Paul Rubens, whose meteoric rise and sustained success as a society painter forms a revealing contrast with Rembrandt's unhappier relationship with fame and fortune.\nThis is a gorgeous book to own, too. Rembrandt's Eyes is printed on heavy, high-gloss paper and lavishly illustrated throughout in full color. The double-page color spreads of the most memorable of Rembrandt's works will take readers' breath away","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f15442dceb922346d2b519aaaf3a38d6502103f","amp;dn":"Rembrandt%27s+Eyes+by+Simon+Schama.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f15442dceb922346d2b519aaaf3a38d6502103f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,21,68,45,206,185,34,52,109,43,81,154,170,243,163,141,101,2,16,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
