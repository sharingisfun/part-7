The ship's pilot is, in fact, an anthropologist from Mars and is now stranded on Earth. Tim O'Hara, a young newspaper reporter for The Los Angeles Sun, is on his way home from Edwards Air Force Base (where he had gone to report on the flight of the X-15) back to Los Angeles when he spots the spaceship coming down.\n\nTim takes the Martian in as his roommate and passes him off as his Uncle Martin. Uncle Martin refuses to reveal any of his Martian traits to people other than Tim, to avoid publicity (or panic), and Tim agrees to keep Martin's identity a secret while the Martian attempts to repair his ship. Uncle Martin has various unusual powers: he can raise from his head two retractable antennae and become invisible; he is telepathic and can read and influence minds; he can levitate objects with the motion of his finger; he can communicate with animals; and he can also speed himself (and other people) up to do work.\n\nThe show starred Ray Walston as Uncle Martin (the Martian) and Bill Bixby as Tim O'Hara.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Favorite_Martian&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Favorite_Martian&lt;/a&gt;\n\nblack &amp; white","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bff85226a467dddea7c1c79fed0d42f4a635c74e","amp;dn":"My+Favorite+Martian+1963+Season+1+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bff85226a467dddea7c1c79fed0d42f4a635c74e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,248,82,38,164,103,221,222,167,193,199,159,237,13,66,244,166,53,199,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
