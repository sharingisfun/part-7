Functional groups are organized around mechanistic similarities, emphasizing what functional groups do rather than how they are made. Tying together the reactivity of a functional group and the synthesis of compounds resulting from its reactivity prevents students from needing to memorize lists of unrelated reactions. The Sixth Edition has been revised and streamlined throughout to enhance clarity and accessibility, and adds a wealth of new problems and problem-solving strategies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:524a631e5bc94ab2abb3e7f77b56f2999a41e455","amp;dn":"Organic+Chemistry+4E+2003+Paula+Bruice+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"524a631e5bc94ab2abb3e7f77b56f2999a41e455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,74,99,30,91,201,74,178,171,179,231,247,123,86,242,153,154,65,228,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
