The fact that Miles Davis, for some 40 years, steadfastly refused to offer his fans a backwards glance in the face of new and more interesting musical challenges, only adds to the poignancy of this July 8, 1991 event. It's as if he knew that, in a spiritual sense, he had to face this music one last time. Miles rises one last time to the challenge of these ancient themes, going out like a champion...with his boots on.\n\n\nMiles Davis / Quincy Jones\n\nMiles &amp; Quincy: Live at Montreux \n\n1991\n\n\n  CD / 1993 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
