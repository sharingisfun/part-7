Duphly's choice of instrument and approach in composing for it continued -- and apparently concluded -- a tradition that stretched back to the early seventeenth century and included among its proponents such figures as FranÃ§ois Couperin and Jean-Philippe Rameau. Blindfolded, listeners would have a hard time telling certain works of Duphly apart from Couperin, although by comparison they are longer; Couperin's pieces average about 4-6 minutes, whereas with Duphly it's more like 6-8 minutes. It isn't just a matter of pacing or repeats; Duphly's sequences are longer, as are his harmonic projections of a given tune. Duphly published four volumes of harpsichord music and only the last one, published in 1768, shows some concessions to classical style; the rest are resolutely Baroque and show no evidence of yielding any quarter to the milieu of that upstart, the piano. Recordings of Duphly within his own context, rather than a piece or two offered within a collection or to fill out a disc of Couperin, are reasonably uncommon, although a recording of his complete output, on four discs, was made back in the 1990s. Alpha Productions' Jacques Duphly: PiÃ¨ces de Clavecin, featuring harpsichordist Elisabeth JoyÃ©, is a very good introduction to his general sound and far more accessible by virtue of its selectiveness, compiling 14 of the best of Duphly's 52 surviving compositions.&quot;\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nA bio is enclosed.
