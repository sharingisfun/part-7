When Europeans first stepped into the island of Australia they saw it as a young country, but nothing could have been farther from the truth. In reality, Australia is a land with the oldest rocks and oldest fossils on Earth, all harbouring secrets from the time when the planet was being formed. Scattered around the sunburnt face of the country, there are clues and enigmas that reveal our planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deep past: remains of vast reef systems, bold footprints of bygone creatures, remnants of prehistoric jungles and long, forgotten ancestors. Richard travels around this enormous country, following the ancient clues to unlock the secrets of time. Aided by stunning natural landscapes and state-of-the-art CGI, Australia: The Time TravellerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide brings to life ancient and terrifying animals, as well as RichardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voyage to the beginning of time itself.\n\nPart 1: Early Days\nOf all continents on Earth, none preserve the story of the formation of our planet and the evolution of life quite like Australia. Nowhere else can you simply jump in a car and travel back through the entire history of the world. Australia: The Time Traveller's Guide takes you on a rollicking adventure from the birth of the Earth to the emergence of the world we know today. Buckle up for a rocky ride down the Road of Time with series host Dr Richard Smith. Over four one-hour episodes, we meet titanic dinosaurs and giant kangaroos, sea monsters and prehistoric crustaceans, disappearing mountains and exploding asteroids. Epic in scope, intimate in nature, this is the untold story of the land Down Under, the one island continent that has got it all. So join the good Doctor for the ultimate outback road trip: an exploration of the history of the planet as seen through the mind-altering window of the Australian continent. In this first episode, Dr Richard Smith guides us through the early years of the Earth's formation, from the Hadean period onwards.\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2053 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 45.Mins\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 701 MB\nEncoded by: Harry65\nSource: PDTV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc2ee1301e8b411bcf0e9790a0794fc781688ead","amp;dn":"Australia.The.Time.Travellers.Guide.1of4.The.Early.Days.PDTV.Xvi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc2ee1301e8b411bcf0e9790a0794fc781688ead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,46,225,48,30,139,65,27,207,14,151,144,160,121,79,199,129,104,142,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
