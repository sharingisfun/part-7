Even Stones drummer Charlie Watts pops up on a couple of tracks. Also, this rarefied company didn't have decent material to stretch out their chops. Most of the songs sound like demos or unfinished sketches with new overdubs -- like the instrumental &quot;Redeyes,&quot; which seems little more than an excuse for Wood to trot out his Dobro skills. &quot;Wind Howlin' Through&quot; asks if the listener can hear that happening, but little more, and wastes a drumming cameo from Devo's Alan Myers.\n\nWood's vocals are strained -- and often impossible to decipher. They're little more than huffs and puffs on the otherwise thumping title cut, and they spoil the reggae-ish &quot;She Was Out There,&quot; which is one of the better moments here -- but &quot;Fountains of Love&quot; is lackluster blue-eyed soul that doesn't get off the ground. The best moments are the least contrived, notably the country-ish swagger of &quot;Outlaws&quot;; the glistening &quot;Priceless&quot;; and &quot;She Never Told Me,&quot; which boasts a lengthy, biting guitar solo. However, it arrives too late to save this album. While hardly a total embarrassment, 1234 is easily Wood's least distinguished solo effort, although his drawings are nice.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01. 1234\n02.
