The main plot of the series occurred in the six-issue Infinity War miniseries, which was written by Jim Starlin and illustrated by Ron Lim. Infinity War was a sequel to the Infinity Gauntlet miniseries, and was followed a year later by the Infinity Crusade crossover miniseries.\n\nThe primary villain of the crossover was the Magus, who was created when Adam Warlock expelled good and evil from his soul after attaining omnipotence in the conclusion of the Infinity Gauntlet miniseries. The evil portion of his soul became the Magus, while the good portion of his soul became the Goddess, who is eventually seen at the end of Infinity War and is the main villain of Infinity Crusade. To battle the Magus and his army of evil doppelgÃƒÂ¤ngers, Adam Warlock and Earth&amp;#039;s heroes teamed up with Thanos, the villain of the Infinity Gauntlet.\n\n(Taken from the wikipedia article)\n\nI&amp;#039;ve also uploaded Infinity Gauntlet, check my torrents! :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06bc8d6bcea635f65deb39479e42b6a4829cd79a","amp;dn":"%231-6+Infinity+War+%28comic%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06bc8d6bcea635f65deb39479e42b6a4829cd79a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,188,141,107,206,166,53,246,93,235,57,71,158,66,182,164,130,156,215,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
