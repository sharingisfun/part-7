More than just earth-friendly, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also beautiful, clever, and witty, stitched with traditional binding techniques. Egg cartons, wood, beer cans, and cassette tapes morph into covers, while brown bags, coffee filters, and discarded newspapers are transformed into pages. Create a boxed set of cereal box books, an exposed stitch sketchbook out of cardboard and remnants, and even a faux leather journal made from teabags.\n\nIn addition to how-to drawings, close-up detail photographs, and simple stitch diagrams, a gallery of eco-books from an international roster of artists provides inspiration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62445d6871e4bbbdd7d5dd06bdf9eb7496debf2f","amp;dn":"Eco+Books%3A+Inventive+Projects+from+the+Recycling+Bin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62445d6871e4bbbdd7d5dd06bdf9eb7496debf2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,68,93,104,113,228,187,189,215,213,221,6,189,249,235,116,150,222,191,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
