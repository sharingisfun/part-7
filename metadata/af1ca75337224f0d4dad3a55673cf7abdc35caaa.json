The designs are simple, but the wools are rich and sumptuous. Imagine snuggling into-and showing off-a handmade cozy white cardigan and matching scarf in a thick, chunky yarn; a black cashmere hooded design; or a buttery soft gray Merino wool cable sweater. If you love tweeds, a silk and mohair sweater in a classic crew neck is the one for you. Go graceful in a versatile ballet-neck style, while an evening out calls for a silvery sweater that makes you shine. There are lightweight spring and summer fashions, too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af1ca75337224f0d4dad3a55673cf7abdc35caaa","amp;dn":"Knitting+Simple+Sweaters+from+Luxurious+Yarns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af1ca75337224f0d4dad3a55673cf7abdc35caaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,28,167,83,55,34,79,13,77,173,58,85,103,60,247,171,220,53,202,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
