While 20th Century Fox led the way with the first Shirley Temple LP collections in the early '60s, among the earliest editions to appear on the CD format was America's Sweetheart, a two-volume anthology released in 1996 on the Pearl label. Vol. 1 ropes in 25 examples taken from the films Bright Eyes; Stand Up and Cheer; Baby, Take a Bow; The Little Colonel; Our Little Girl; Curly Top; The Littlest Rebel; Captain January; Poor Little Rich Girl, and Dimples. Unlike most Temple collections, the excerpts are presented chronologically, beginning with &quot;On the Good Ship Lollipop&quot; from 1934 and ending with a thrilling buck dance sequence that materialized in 1936. If you're looking to invest in a couple of outstanding Temple albums, Pearl's America's Sweetheart is probably the best choice imaginable. The tip-tapping tot ages ever so gradually over the course of the project, and the first volume's highlights include a full-length, unedited version of the song &quot;Baby, Take a Bow&quot;; lullabies sung a cappella or over the tinkling of a music box; an in-your-face soap commercial chanted by an adult mixed choir; a stimulating tap dance sequence to the tune of &quot;I Love a Military Man,&quot; and what has got to be the all-time strangest rendition ever recorded of the famous &quot;Sextette&quot; from Donizetti's opera Lucia di Lammermoor. The logical sequel to this would have involved dressing her up in a blood-stained nightgown for a fresh approach to Lucia's famous Mad Scene. As this does not seem to have occurred, (at least not in front of the cameras) it must be counted amongst history's great lost opportunities.\nAll Music Review by arwulf arwulf\n\n### - Sorry I DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Have Vol.2 - ###\n\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] On The Good Ship Lollipop\n[02] Baby, Take A Bow\n[03] On Account - A I Love You\n[04] Love's Young Dream\n[05] Lullaby To A Doll\n[06] Animal Crackers In My Soup\n[07] When I Grow Up\n[08] Believe Me, If All Those Endearing Young  Charms\n[09] Song And Dance\n[10] Polly Wolly Doodle\n[11] Early Bird\n[12] At The Codfish Ball\n[13] Sextette From Lucia\n[14] The Right Somebody To Love\n[15] Oh, My Goodness\n[16] Buy A Bar Of Barry's; When I'm With You\n[17] But Definitely\n[18] Peck's Theme Song\n[19] You've Gotta Eat Your Spinach, Baby\n[20] I Love A Military Man\n[21] Hey!
