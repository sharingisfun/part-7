This album includes quite a diverse collection of songs. &quot;On Your Porch&quot; and &quot;A Save Situation&quot; are both beautiful acoustic ballads with moving vocals, while &quot;Tune Out&quot;, &quot;Sore Thumb&quot;, and &quot;Wait, Wait, Wait&quot; are all easy to sing to as well as just being feel good songs. The strong point of this album I believe is its stirring lyrics. They are both thought-provoking and alluring, along with poetic. &quot;Interventions and Lullabies&quot; is a record you can listen to time and time again, no matter what kind of mood you're in. The Format does a wonderful job with this one, creating an enduring piece of art that will be appreciated well into the future. \n\nTrack List: \n1. The First Single \t\n2. Wait, Wait, Wait \t\n3.
