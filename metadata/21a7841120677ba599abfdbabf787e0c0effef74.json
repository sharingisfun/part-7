Although titled Trinere, it is most notable for the Freestyle (group name before it became a DJ &amp; sports term) and Debbie Deb classics. Here are some reviews...\n\n\nThis is one of the better Freestyle Compilation albums out there. You get both of Debbie Debbs hits,&quot;Lookout Weekends&quot; and &quot;When I hear Music&quot;...and you get the best cuts from the group Freestyle...&quot;The Party has just begun&quot; and &quot;Don't stop the Rock&quot;...you also get almost all of Trinere's best...the song i was really bummed out they didn't include was &quot;they're playing our song&quot;and if you're after this one and all of Trinere's best then buy her anthology, it has everything!...for the foremost this is like i said one the better Freestyle compilations out. You can play this one from start to finish!!!I STILL PLAY MOST OF THIS ALBUM IN THE CLUBS TODAY. \n\n\nIf you happened to be around the Los Angeles area party scene during the early 80's, there's little doubt you've &quot;gotten-down&quot; to most of these excellent tracks at least once. Even today, these jams are dancefloor scorchers for old-skool and new groovers alike. A Must Have! Thumbs up to AMAZON for stocking such a rare compilation.\n\n320 bit rate MP3\n\nTrack listing\n\n1 \tDebbie Deb ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ \tLookout Weekend \t6:15 \t\n2 \tFreestyle ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ \tThe Party's Just Begun \t6:30 \t\n3 \tTrinere ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ \tI Know You Love Me \t4:02 \t\n4 \tFreestyle ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ \tIt's Automatic \t        4:24 \t\n5 \tTrinere ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ \tAll Night \t        4:04 \t\n6 \tTrinere ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ \tHow Can We Be Wrong \t5:48 \t\n7 \tDebbie Deb ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ \tWhen I Hear Music \t7:08 \t\n8 \tFreestyle ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ \tDon't Stop The Rock \t5:32 \t\n9 \tTrinere ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ \tCan't Stop The Beat \t4:53 \t\n10 \tTrinere ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ \tI'll Be All You Ever Need \t4:06 \t\n11 \tTrinere ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ \tCan't Get Enough \t        6:31 \t\n12 \tTrinere ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ \tCan't Stop The Beat (House Mix)\t5:33 \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21a7841120677ba599abfdbabf787e0c0effef74","amp;dn":"Trinere+%26amp%3B+Friends+-+Greatest+Hits+%28+Debbie+Deb+%26amp%3B+Freesty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21a7841120677ba599abfdbabf787e0c0effef74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,167,132,17,32,103,123,165,153,171,253,186,191,120,126,12,14,255,239,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
