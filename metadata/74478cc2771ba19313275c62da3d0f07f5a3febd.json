Florence Welch\n[b]Size:[/b] 4.83 Mb\n[b]Format:[/b] MP3\n[b]Language:[/b] English\n\nDJ Calvin Harris releases the collaboration with Florence Welch entitled &quot;Sweet Nothing&quot; as the fifth single from his third studio album &quot;18 Months&quot;, due for release in the UK on October 29th via Fly Eye Records! This sounds like another monster hit for Mr Harris. Florence's almost-divine vocals, and Calvin's uplifting electro-dance beats make an exceptional combination.\n\n[i][b]Lyrics:[/b][/i] \n\nYou took my heart and you held it in your mouth\n And, with a word all my love came rushing out\n And, every whisper, it's the worst, emptied out by a single word\n There is a hollow in me now\n\n So I put my faith in something unknown\n I'm living on such sweet nothing\n But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold\n I'm living on such sweet nothing\n And it's hard to learn\n And it's hard to love\n When you're giving me such sweet nothing\n Sweet nothing, sweet nothing\n You're giving me such sweet nothing\n\n [Beat break]\n\n It isn't easy for me to let it go\n Cause\n I've swallow every single word\n And\n Every whisper, every sigh\n Eats away at this heart of mine\n And there is a hollow in me now\n\n So I put my faith in something unknown\n I'm living on such sweet nothing\n But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold\n I'm living on such sweet nothing\n And it's hard to learn\n And it's hard to love\n When you're giving me such sweet nothing\n Sweet nothing, sweet nothing\n You're giving me such sweet nothing\n\n [Beat break]\n\n And it's not enough\n To tell me that you care\n When, we both know the words are empty air\n You give me nothing\n\n Uoooh\n Uoooh\n Uoooh\n Nothing\n\n [Beat break]\n\n Uoooh\n Uoooh\n Uoooh\n\n Sweet Nothing\n\n Uoooh\n Uoooh\n Uoooh\n Sweet Nothing\n\nThanks\n[img]http://kastatic.com/i2/userpics/824bade088c9791153165b4ab65e1512.gif[/img]\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74478cc2771ba19313275c62da3d0f07f5a3febd","amp;dn":"Sweet+Nothing+-+Calvin+Harris+-+ft.+Florence+Welch+%5Bitunes%5D.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74478cc2771ba19313275c62da3d0f07f5a3febd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,71,140,194,119,27,161,147,19,39,92,98,218,61,15,7,245,163,254,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
