Modules can be mixed and matched so you can build hybrids, but what sets DIVA apart is the sheer authenticity of the analogue sound. This comes at the cost of quite a high CPU-hit, but we think it was worth it: Diva is the first native software synth that applies methods from industrial circuit simulators (e.g. PSpice) in realtime. The behaviour of zero-delay-feedback filters when pushed to the limit clearly demonstrates the advantages of this groundbreaking approach. \n\nCheck out more than 1200 presets. If your computer can handle it, try them in &quot;Divine&quot; mode.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c266ab4ff20e3e3e7bdf24329973fcedcaac96","amp;dn":"U-He+-+Diva+1.0+-+MAC+-+AU+-+%5BK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c266ab4ff20e3e3e7bdf24329973fcedcaac96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,194,102,171,79,242,14,62,62,123,223,36,50,153,115,252,237,202,172,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
