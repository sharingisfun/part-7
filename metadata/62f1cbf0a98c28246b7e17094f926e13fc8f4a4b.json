In that context,\nthis 24-song CD from the U.K. constitutes the mother lode, at least until\nsomeone does a box (fat chance) on this satirical country-based rock group.\nEverything here dates between 1972 and 1974, and 21 of the songs are the\nwork of the late Shel Silverstein, either solo or as a collaborator, so you\nknow this is the real article and the distillation of the group's best\nclassic work -- and the sound is good as well, the guitar, piano, bass,\nand brass getting lots of bite on &quot;Queen of the Silver Dollar,&quot; the mocking\nlead guitar on &quot;Cover of the Rolling Stone&quot; crisp and bright, while the\nsteel guitar is up close and personal on &quot;Sylvia's Mother&quot; like it never\nwas on the radio. And the vocals were never more fun than they are here.\nThis is best part of the group's entire output for the three years\nrepresented. If the two biggest hits don't do it for you, then &quot;Hey,\nLady Godiva&quot; is worth the price of admission by itself, and the only crime\nis that there are no notes to tell of the background on these songs or the\nband or Silverstein. And the handful of non-Silverstein songs actually\nmake a good contrast\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n  01 - Sylvia's mother [03:51]\n  02 - Queen of the silver dollar [04:42]\n  03 - Marie Lavaux [02:39]\n  04 - Cover of The Rolling Stone [02:50]\n  05 - The ballad of Lucy Jordan [03:54]\n  06 - Hey, Lady Godiva [02:18]\n  07 - Four years older than me [02:32]\n  08 - Makin' it natural [02:50]\n  09 - Freakin' at the freaker's [02:47]\n  10 - If I'd only come and gone [02:41]\n  11 - Carry me, Carrie [04:18]\n  12 - Penicillin Penny [02:49]\n  13 - Life ain't easy [03:02]\n  14 - Roland, the roadie and Gertrude, the groupie [03:01]\n  15 - Acapulco Goldie [02:19]\n  16 - When Lily was queen [02:26]\n  17 - Monterey Jack [01:14]\n  18 - You ain't got the right [03:28]\n  19 - Sing me a rainbow [02:31]\n  20 - Kiss it away [04:04]\n  21 - When she cries [03:02]\n  22 - Judy [03:42]\n  23 - I call that true love [03:00]\n  24 - Mama, I'll sing one song for you [02:36]\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: Dr.Hook &amp; The Medicine Show\nGenre: Rock / country / soft rock\nAlbum Release Year: 2000\nNumber of Tracks: 24\nTotal Duration: 72 Minutes\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.2.1\nEncoding Bit Rate: 848 kbps (Average Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Source: Original CD Release\nConverter: EAC V1.0 beta 3\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nIncluded Artwork: (Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files)\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\nAdditional Files: CUE Sheet, Log Sheet, MD5, FFP, and M3U\nTotal File Size: 445 MB\n\n\nPLEASE SEED  -  PLEASE SHARE  -  PLEASE UPLOAD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62f1cbf0a98c28246b7e17094f926e13fc8f4a4b","amp;dn":"Dr.+Hook+%26amp%3B+the+Medicine+Show+-+Best+of+2000+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62f1cbf0a98c28246b7e17094f926e13fc8f4a4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,241,203,240,169,140,40,36,107,126,23,9,79,146,110,19,252,143,74,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
