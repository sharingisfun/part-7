The course starts with a quick overview of the\n        .NET platform, examining assemblies, Microsoft Intermediate Language,\n        Visual Studio profiles, XML comments, IntelliSense, and debugging.\n        From there, youll learn all the language features that you must\n        internalize in order to create full-featured Web or Windows\n        applications that make best use of the .NET platform. Youll learn\n        about data types, variables, and operators, along with all the \n        important flow control structures. Youll work through several\n        examples demonstrating the power of the .NET Framework, and dig into\n        creating and consuming your own classes and objects. The course moves\n        on to working with data structures, such as arrays and collection\n        classes, before finishing up with discussions of generics, handling\n        exceptions and working with delegates and events. The course concludes\n        by introducing the new LINQ-oriented features including anonymous\n        types, lambda expressions, and more. By the end of this course, you\n        will understand the important basic concepts that will allow you to\n        start creating the applications you need.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTO USE .iso FILES DOWNLOAD THIS;     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Power%20iso%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Power%20iso%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa91ce974f5660961eec7d13b6f86e44e9e02e91","amp;dn":"LEARNING+TO+PROGRAM+USING+VISUAL+BASIC+%5Bthethingy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa91ce974f5660961eec7d13b6f86e44e9e02e91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,145,206,151,79,86,96,150,30,236,125,19,182,248,110,68,233,224,46,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
