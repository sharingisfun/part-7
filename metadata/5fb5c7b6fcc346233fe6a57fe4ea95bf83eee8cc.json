Right after the release of the brand new Widgetkit 2.1, Salt impresses with two Grid Slider bonus widgets, which make it a great base for any kind of shop website. The fullscreen overlay menu and a custom blog style give the theme a unique feel and style.\n\nWith the Grid Slider you can display several slideshows within one grid. The Salt theme includes two Grid Slider bonus widgets featuring some additional functionalities. For example, you can apply a different color to each grid item or display the grid slider in an alternating two column layout.\n\nTo leave more space for your content, Salt uses a fullscreen overlay menu with a single toggle. The accordion-like navigation reveals sub items on hover, so that parent items work as links as well. This menu style is optional. If you decide to stick with the &quot;traditional&quot; top navigation, you can also fix it to the top of the browser.\n\nIn addition to all this, Salt comes with the option to apply 3 different site container widths: Fullscreen, Large and Small. An elegant custom blog style with full width images and a two column text layout can be applied to your articles. To see these and more features in action, check out the theme demo.\n\n- Two Widgetkit 2 Grid Slider bonus widgets\n- Optional Fullscreen Overlay navigation\n- Default navigation can be set fixed\n- 3 different site wrapper widths\n- Custom blog layout\n- 6 pre-built style variations\n- Easy customizer and LESS integration\n- WooCommerce support","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb5c7b6fcc346233fe6a57fe4ea95bf83eee8cc","amp;dn":"YOOTheme+Salt+Wordpress+Template","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fb5c7b6fcc346233fe6a57fe4ea95bf83eee8cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,181,199,182,252,195,70,35,63,230,165,127,228,234,149,191,131,238,232,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
