Development is open to new talent and new ideas, and our software is tested and used daily by a large and devoted user community \n\n\n\nVersion 5 makes much of its user-interface improvements, but while itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely more navigable than before thanks to better placement of tools and visual previews of styles direct from the main toolbar, it still looks a little dated, despite the refreshed icon sets. Nevertheless, this is still a powerful suite capable of meeting most peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s needs, making this zero-cost alternative to Office a valuable tool to have in your armoury. \n\nEver-improving support for third-party file types (including both new and classic Office formats) means youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not cutting yourself off from industry standards while cross-platform support means you can run LibreOffice on Windows, Mac or Linux without having to retrain yourself to a new way of working each time. \n\nVersion 5 introduces a dedicated 64-bit build for Windows, and promises full compatibility with Windows 10. \n\nWhat else is new in LibreOffice 5? \n+ Writer gains a new AutoCorrect extension that simplifies the use of Unicode character input such as Emoji. Word-compatible text highlighting and shading is also preserved. \n+ Calc enjoys the most improvements: support for complex formulae and new functions, plus conditional formatting, image cropping and table addressing features among other improvements. \n+ Impress and Draw have rearranged toolbars to maximise screen editing space, while the appsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ context menus have been streamlined by removing less important entries. \n+ Writer, Impress and Calc users can now crop images using the mouse Ã¢â‚¬â€œ right-click a drawing and choose Crop Image to do so. \n+ Improved interoperability, which means better handling of third-party formats such as DOC, RTF and XLSX, plus Apple Keynote and FreeHand import filter improvements. \n+ Support for new import formats, including Apple Pages and Numbers, Lotus 123 (wk3 and wk4), ClarisDraw and MacDraft. \n\n\n \n\n\n* Just Run to use... \n\n*Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee7b718a532354e76bb05274f104623643de5e40","amp;dn":"LibreOffice+v5.0.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee7b718a532354e76bb05274f104623643de5e40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,123,113,138,83,35,84,231,107,176,82,116,241,4,98,54,67,222,94,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
