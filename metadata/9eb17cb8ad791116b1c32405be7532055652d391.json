Based on the wildly popular comic book series Hellblazer from DC Comics, seasoned demon hunter and master of the occult John Constantine is armed with a ferocious knowledge of the dark arts and a wickedly naughty wit. He fights the good fight - or at least he did. With his soul already damned to hell, he's decided to abandon his campaign against evil until a series of events thrusts him back into the fray when an old friend's daughter becomes the target of supernatural forces.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9eb17cb8ad791116b1c32405be7532055652d391","amp;dn":"Constantine.S01E06.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9eb17cb8ad791116b1c32405be7532055652d391","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,177,124,184,173,121,17,22,177,195,36,5,190,117,50,5,86,82,211,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
