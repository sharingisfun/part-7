Essentially a jam band, Quicksilver Messenger Service gained wide popularity in the Bay Area and with psychedelic rock enthusiasts around the globe. Many of their albums ranked in the top 30 of the Billboard Pop charts. Though not ultimately as popular as contemporaries Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead, the band was integral to the beginnings of their genre. With their jazz and classical influences, as well as a strong folk background, the band attempted to create a sound that was individual and innovative.\nMore: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_Messenger_Service\n\nMembers:\n\nJohn Cipollina ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, vocals \nGary Duncan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, vocals \nGreg Elmore ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums \nDavid Freiberg ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, vocals \nNicky Hopkins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards  \nDino Valente ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ flute, guitar, vocals\nMark Naftalin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards  \nMark Ryan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass \nChuck Steaks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards \n\n\nTorrent includes:\n\nLive In San Jose (1966) \nLost Gold @ Silver 2 CD (1968) \nQuicksilver Messenger Service (1968) \nSmokin Sound (1968) \nHappy Trails (1969)  \nShady Grove (1969) \nJust For Love (1970) \nWhat About Me (1971) \nQuicksilver (1971) \nComin&amp;#039; Thru (1972) \nSons Of Mercury 1968-1975 (1991) ZCD\n\n\nCredits go to knaverlisa\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dc1330eba4118cb6b2fd99ce787f1c70f0a81a3","amp;dn":"Quicksilver+Messenger+Service+-++Discography+%281966-1991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dc1330eba4118cb6b2fd99ce787f1c70f0a81a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,193,51,14,186,65,24,203,107,47,217,156,231,135,241,199,15,10,129,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
