A masterfully controlled intensity. The only sign of vitality on the face of the woman is a sardonic grin of bitterness.\n\nThe Penguin Audiobook of the Selected Poems of Thomas Hardy, excellently read by, amongst others, Jeremy Northam and Derek Jacobi, and interspersed with a literate and interesting biographical commentary. \n\n  (Kindly seed, and if you can't find a seed for any previous poetry torrent go to the folder 'Current Poetry Torrents' and follow the instructions on the pdf.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5725d7fdd744f8f321cc38e4ff6bb93757cf383","amp;dn":"The+Poetry+of+Thomas+Hardy+-+1+-+Penguin+Audiobooks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5725d7fdd744f8f321cc38e4ff6bb93757cf383","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,114,93,127,221,116,79,143,50,28,195,142,79,246,187,147,117,124,243,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
