As its title suggests, the record presents an alternate version of Black Light, an introspective long player that group member Tom Findlay described as showing &quot;the darker side of Groove Armada.&quot; In the time since that album's release this past winter, the duo have played a series of huge festivals across Europe, prompting them to rearrange each track for better effect on stage.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76e062c6f42da487c34d82098e4d8f378adcf5e0","amp;dn":"Groove+Armada+-+White+Light+%5Bmp3-vbr-2010%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76e062c6f42da487c34d82098e4d8f378adcf5e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,224,98,198,244,45,164,135,195,77,130,9,142,77,143,55,138,220,245,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
