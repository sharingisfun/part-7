Combining the hypnotic swirls of minimalism, the free intensity of improvisation and a soaring lyricism, Ã¢â‚¬Å“On Leaves of GrassÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an exhilarating addition to ZornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growing collection of mystical transcendental works. An emotional and virtuosic outing from this Downtown supergroup performing music that speaks to the eternal.
