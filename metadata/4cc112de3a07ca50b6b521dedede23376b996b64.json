He performs simply as Prince, but has also been known by various other names, among them an unpronounceable symbol, leading fans and critics to dub him The Artist Formerly Known As Prince or simply The Artist. Since returning to use of the name &quot;Prince&quot;, some have dubbed him &quot;The artist formerly known as 'the artist formerly known as Prince'&quot;.\n\nPrince is a prolific artist, having released several hundred songs both under his own name and with other artists. He has won six Grammy Awards and an Academy Award, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2004, he was named as the top male pop artist of the past 25 years by ARC Rock on the Net,[1] and Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Prince #28 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[2]\n\nFrom his early material, rooted in R&amp;B, soul and funk, Prince has expanded his musical palette throughout his career, absorbing many other genres including pop, rock, jazz, new wave, psychedelia and hip hop. Some of his primary influences include Sly Stone, Curtis Mayfield, Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, James Brown and Carlos Santana. The distinctive characteristics of his early-to-mid 1980s work, such as sparse and industrial-sounding drum machine arrangements and the use of synthesizer riffs to serve the role traditionally occupied by horn riffs in earlier R&amp;B, funk and soul music, were called the &quot;Minneapolis sound&quot; and have proved very influential.\n\n[b]The Hits/The B-Sides [/b] is the first greatest hits compilation album by Prince, released in 1993. It is a comprehensive 3-disc set, with a great many of his hit singles and fan favorites. Four new tracks ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ &quot;Pink Cashmere,&quot; &quot;Peach,&quot; &quot;Pope,&quot; and &quot;Power Fantastic&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ are also included.\n\nDisc one and two were released separately, under the titles The Hits 1 and The Hits 2 respectively, but the B-Sides disc could only be obtained by purchasing the full set. Most of the songs (A-sides and B-sides) on The Hits/The B-Sides are represented in their single (edited) form, but this was necessary due to time constraints, and the nature of a greatest-hits collection. Exceptions to this were &quot;Alphabet St.,&quot; &quot;Little Red Corvette,&quot;and &quot;Purple Rain.&quot; This was also the first time the single version of &quot;Kiss&quot; was available on CD. The third disc of B-sides also featured the 7&quot; edits, with the exceptions of &quot;200 Balloons,&quot; &quot;17 Days,&quot; &quot;Gotta Stop (Messin' About),&quot; &quot;Horny Toad,&quot; &quot;Feel U Up,&quot; &quot;I Love U In Me,&quot; &quot;God,&quot; and &quot;How Come You Don't Call Me Anymore?,&quot; which were all original full-length recordings from the original singles.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrince The Hits 1 \n\n\n\n1.\t&quot;When Doves Cry&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:48 (single edit) \n2.\t&quot;Pop Life&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:42 \n3.\t&quot;Soft and Wet&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:03 \n4.\t&quot;I Feel for You&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:25 \n5.\t&quot;Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:48 \n6.\t&quot;When You Were Mine&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:43 \n7.\t&quot;Uptown&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:09 (single edit) \n8.\t&quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:39 \n9.\t&quot;1999&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:37 (single edit) \n10.\t&quot;I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:40 (single edit) \n11.\t&quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:58 (previously unreleased) \n12.\t&quot;Adore&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:41 (edit) \n13.\t&quot;Pink Cashmere&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 6:15 (previously unreleased) \n14.\t&quot;Alphabet St.&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 5:39 \n15.\t&quot;Sign &quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®&quot; the Times&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:43 (single edit) \n16.\t&quot;Thieves in the Temple&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:20 \n17.\t&quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:20 (single edit) \n18.\t&quot;7&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 5:09 \n\n\n\n\n\nPrince The Hits 2\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Controversy&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:35 (single edit) \n2.\t&quot;Dirty Mind&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:49 \n3.\t&quot;I Wanna Be Your Lover&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:58 (single edit) \n4.\t&quot;Head&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:43 \n5.\t&quot;Do Me, Baby&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:57 (single edit) \n6.\t&quot;Delirious&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:39 (single edit) \n7.\t&quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:56 \n8.\t&quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:57 (single edit) \n9.\t&quot;Raspberry Beret&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:32 \n10.\t&quot;If I Was Your Girlfriend&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:46 (single edit) \n11.\t&quot;Kiss&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:46 (single edit) \n12.\t&quot;Peach&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:48 (previously unreleased) \n13.\t&quot;U Got the Look&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:47 \n14.\t&quot;Sexy M.F.&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 5:26 \n15.\t&quot;Gett Off&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:30 \n16.\t&quot;Cream&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:13 \n17.\t&quot;Pope&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:28 (previously unreleased) \n18.\t&quot;Purple Rain&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 8:40 \n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cc112de3a07ca50b6b521dedede23376b996b64","amp;dn":"Prince+-+The+Hits+%282+CD%29+1993+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cc112de3a07ca50b6b521dedede23376b996b64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,193,18,222,58,7,202,80,182,181,33,222,222,222,35,55,107,153,107,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
