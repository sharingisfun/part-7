Six years later Libby is paroled and with the help of Travis Lehman (her parole officer) she sets out to find her son and the truth behind the &quot;murder&quot;.\n\nLibby Parsons is happily married to Nick and has a wonderful son, Matty. One day while spending the night on their boat, Libby wakes up and finds Nick gone and blood all over the boat and a bloody knife. When an investigation begins, it's discovered that Nick was in financial trouble and had a two million dollar insurance policy. Though Libby claims that she knew nothing about it, she would be convicted and sent to prison. She entrusts Matty to her friend, Angela and it's during one of her calls to Matty that she learns that Nick is alive. And she also learns that since she's already been convicted of killing Nick already, she can kill him and not be charged. After seven years she's paroled and placed in the custody of Travis, a parole officer. When she tries to find Matty, she breaks a few laws including the parole restrictions. So Travis wants to report her but she escapes to look for her son with Travis on her trail. \n\n\nTAGLINE:\n\n\nMurder isn't always a crime.\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/6bee15f6f0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/6bee15f6f0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAll stand-alone divx players compatible\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS U CAN !!!! \n\n\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.
