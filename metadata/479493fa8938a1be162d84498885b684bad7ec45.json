More than a dictionary, the book also provides information on properties, units, equations, techniques, and pioneers in the field. The comprehensive content covers both current and older terms, complete cross-references for the most important synonyms, abbreviations, and acronyms, and numerous tables for the quick overview.\r\n\r\nAn authoritative reference, vital for unhindered communication and knowledge transfer in this fast-growing and broadly interdisciplinary field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:479493fa8938a1be162d84498885b684bad7ec45","amp;dn":"Nano-+and+Microtechnology+from+A-Z","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"479493fa8938a1be162d84498885b684bad7ec45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,148,147,250,137,56,161,190,22,45,132,73,136,133,182,132,186,215,236,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
