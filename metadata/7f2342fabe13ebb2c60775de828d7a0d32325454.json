Revisions from the author's notes are included, allowing a deeper view into her world and a better understanding of her work. The Nebula AwardÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning short story Love Is the Plan, the Plan Is Death, the Hugo AwardÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning novella The Girl Who Was Plugged In, and the Hugo and Nebula AwardÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning novella Houston, Houston, Do You Read? are included.\n\nThe stories of Alice Sheldon, who wrote as James Tiptree Jr. ( Up the Walls of the World ) until her death in 1987, have been heretofore available mostly in out-of-print collections. Thus the 18 accomplished stories here will be welcomed by new readers and old fans. ''The Screwfly Solution'' describes a chilling, elegant answer to the population problem. In ''Love Is the Plan the Plan Is Death,'' the title tells the tale--species survival insured by imprinted drives--but the story's force is in its exquisite, lyrical prose and its suggestion that personal uniqueness is possible even within biological imperatives. ''The Girl Who Was Plugged In'' is a future boy-meets-girl story with a twist unexpected by the players. ''The Women Men Don't See '' displays Tiptree's keen insight and ability to depict singularity within the ordinary. In Hugo and Nebula award-winning ''Houston, Houston, Do You Read?'' astronauts flying by the sun slip forward 500 years and encounter a culture that successfully questions gender roles in ours.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction by Michael Swanwick\n\nThe Last Flight of Doctor Ain\nThe Screwfly Solution\nAnd I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold HillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Side\nThe Girl Who Was Plugged In\nThe Man Who Walked Home\nAnd I Have Come Upon This Place by Lost Ways\nThe Women Men DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t See\nYour Faces, O My Sisters!
