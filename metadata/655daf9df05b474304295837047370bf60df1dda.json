I thought for sure I'd already seen it here. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n'The Technopriests Book 3 The Perfect Game'\n\nHumanoids, Inc., 2001, 96 pages\n\nWritten by Alexandro Jodorowsky\n\nIllustrated by Zoran Janjetov\n\nTHE TECHNOPRIESTS saga concludes as Albino the Supreme Technopriest fights galactic battleships and cosmic fortresses in his grandest battle yet! Jodorowsky and Janjetov create a gorgeous space opera adventure that pushes the imaginative limits of comics.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are several uploads containing the first two books of this series already available at TPB. I looks like they're still being seeded, but if there's any issues downloading them just leave a comment and I'll upload them as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:655daf9df05b474304295837047370bf60df1dda","amp;dn":"The+Technopriests+Book+3+The+Perfect+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"655daf9df05b474304295837047370bf60df1dda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,93,175,157,240,91,71,67,4,41,88,55,4,115,112,191,96,223,29,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
