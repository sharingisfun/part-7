Putt-Putt's Fun House isn't in the package because it's not supported by pc and I believe is a mobile game if I'm not mistaken. Will be putting up Freddi Fish and Spy Fox soon not sure about other Humongous Entertainment titties. All you do is extract it and run each batch file for each game or run the .exe. Sorry for the games not being labeled. The .exe wasn't done by me and I got lazy to rename each batch file.
