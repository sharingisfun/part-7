BBC Studios - A Night Of Wonder (NTSC)\n\nThis is a really interesting disc I found in a used clearance bin at my local Half Price Books. It's a cheaply packaged bootleg disguised as a legit dvd and somehow &quot;New Media/highline Play&quot; and several other nonlegible &quot;labels&quot; are on it. No affiliation to Motown or Universal mentioned anywhere. In fact while it gives a NY company address, It has a chinese product stamp on it. Fakety fakety fake!\n\nThis was a show Stevie did for BBC Studios in 1995 when his Conversation Peace album was released. I have been having a hard time finding the exact date it was recorded or aired in 1995 (help anyone?)\n\nIn true bootleg fashion, It has a gawdy Microsoft Word circa 1995-esque cover, and the aspect ratio was wrong. I was able to correct the files back to their original 4:3 setting, as they just had the wrong settings in the IFO files.\n\nIt claims 5.1 Surround on the box but my guess is the &quot;5.1&quot; track is a fake. Anyways - hope you all enjoy, as it is a great show.\n\nApprox 55 min. - 4:3 Aspect Ratio - Single Layer NTSC - Studio and &quot;5.1&quot; Audio tracks.\n\nTracklist\n\nMaster Blaster\nHigher Ground\nSensuous Whisper\nMy Cheri Amor\nSigned, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\nSir Duke / I Wish\nYou Are The Sunshine Of My Life\nSupersition\nI Just Called To Say I Love You\nCold Chill\nDo I Do","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0d0557bfa2bc3c5e3b654146332d534a8aa894f","amp;dn":"Stevie+Wonder+-+A+Night+Of+Wonder+1995+BBC+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0d0557bfa2bc3c5e3b654146332d534a8aa894f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,208,85,123,250,43,195,197,227,182,84,20,99,50,213,52,168,170,137,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
