You've seen his energetic stand-up performances on HBO, Comedy Central, and in venues across the globe. Now Lewis Black's volcanic eruptions can be found in Nothing's Sacred, a collection of rants against stupidity and authority, which oftentimes go hand in hand.\n\nWith subversive wit and intellectual honesty, Lewis examines the events of his life that shaped his anti-authoritarian point of view and developed his comedic perspective. Growing up in 1950s suburbia when father knew best and there was a sitcom to prove it, he began to regard authority with a jaundiced eye at an early age. And as that sentiment grew stronger with each passing year, so did his ability to hone in on the absurd.\n\nTrue to form, he puts common sense above ideology and distills hilarious, biting commentary on all things politically and culturally relevant. \n\n\nRead by Lewis Black\nFormat: MP3\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59693580dbf6ba5ebf3181ed9d6b00945c664efb","amp;dn":"Lewis+Black+-+Nothing%27s+Sacred","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59693580dbf6ba5ebf3181ed9d6b00945c664efb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,105,53,128,219,246,186,94,191,49,129,237,157,107,0,148,92,102,78,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
