Forced into nearly two decades of no-holds-barred fights against other abductees inside an unearthly mixed martial arts arena, Trevor has evolved from an innocent boy into a brutal fighting machine. Derek, (Jeff Hatch) an ambulance chasing lawyer, is the latest lab-rat abductee forced to fight Trevor. As the two men exchange ever-increasing beatings over the course of weeks and months, the brutality of their existence and the true nature of their humanity is slowly revealed. With elements of THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE PRISONER, BRUTAL explores through science fiction, allegory and psychological drama, man's violent nature and our propensity to commit unthinkable acts of violence against each other. Yet through this prism of brutality our capacity to love one another, even in the worst of circumstances is celebrated.\r\n\r\nDirectors: Donald Lawrence Flaherty, Colin Follenweider\r\nWriter: Donald Lawrence Flaherty\r\nStars: Morgan Benoit, Jeff Hatch, David Mattey\r\nGenres: Action | Drama | Horror | Sci-Fi | Sport\r\nCountry: USA\r\nLanguage: English\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE: Brutal.2015.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO\r\n                                             \r\nSOURCE: 720p - Thanks King-DVD!                                              \r\n\r\nViDEO: 2100 Kbps\r\n\r\nRESOLUTiON: 720x400\r\n\r\nRUNTiME: 1h 25m 43s \r\n\r\nSUBTiTLES: No                             \r\n\r\nAUDiO: 192 Kbps AC3 2.0      \r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLiSH                                    \r\n\r\nNOTES: Enjoy.\r\n\r\n SPECIAL THANKS TO: The Big Boss WIGWIG, ANSA, ACHOSINK,\r\n                 HAMADA, MAZENTBT, CD-Moonlight, EMPEROR_DVD.    \r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aMvm \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aMvi \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aMvl \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aMvI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f58500e9f6d5399e4d5117bb1b5418c3a6eb7953","amp;dn":"Brutal.2015.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f58500e9f6d5399e4d5117bb1b5418c3a6eb7953","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,133,0,233,246,213,57,158,77,81,23,187,27,84,24,195,166,235,121,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
