Establishing a new mode of representing architecture and describing the emerging modern landscape with magnificent authority, he enjoyed high patronage in the 1850s and 1860s. Yet, despite the artist's renown during his lifetime, his name is all but unknown today, his work savored only by connoisseurs.\n\nThis book, the first to chronicle the life and career of this important artist, brings his work once more before the public. The superb quality of the reproductions captures the subtle tones and soft matte surfaces of the original prints, many of which are published here for the first time.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fcc7ccb5789ba504e3420e1a83d1669c48f9384","amp;dn":"The+Photographs+of+%26Eacute%3Bdouard+Baldus+%28Art+Photography+Histor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fcc7ccb5789ba504e3420e1a83d1669c48f9384","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,204,124,203,87,137,186,80,78,52,32,225,168,61,22,105,196,143,147,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
