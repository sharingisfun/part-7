GoldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impressive CV also included songs for Leo Sayer (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Endless FlightÃ¢â‚¬Å“) and Wynonna JuddÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n(Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Saw the LightÃ¢â‚¬Å“), the band Wax with Graham Gouldman of 10cc (Gold had to turn down an offer to join 10cc in 1981, but the duo enjoyed great U.K. success with a Top 10 single, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bridge to Your HeartÃ¢â‚¬Å“) and a TV theme success of his own: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Final Frontier,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sung by Gold but written by actor Paul Reiser and Don Was, played over the opening credits to Mad About You for the majority of its seven-season run. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an indelible musical legacy that, sadly, outlives Gold, who passed away in 2011.\n\nEdselÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“four-ferÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ not only includes all four Asylum releases Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1975's self-titled debut, 1976's WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wrong with This Picture? and 1978's All This and Heaven Too and Whirlwind Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but a third disc includes all 20 bonus tracks included on the long out-of-print Andrew Gold remasters released on the CollectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choice label in 2005. Alternate versions of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lonely BoyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thank YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are included, along with various gems that had never been released in any format before.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b0bdd2f01e10f7e99f1fd08a1df4afe431d7c5c","amp;dn":"Andrew+Gold+-+%5BBox+Set%5D+AG%2C+Picture%2C+Whirlwind%26hellip%3B+Plus+%28201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b0bdd2f01e10f7e99f1fd08a1df4afe431d7c5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,11,221,47,1,225,15,126,153,241,253,8,161,223,74,254,67,29,124,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
