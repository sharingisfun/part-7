As more people are becoming aware of their dietary restrictions, Emilyâ€™s exquisite cakes provide a solution that leaves everyone happy while dismissing the idea that vegan and gluten-free desserts are by nature unattractive. Pure Artistry includes recipes for staple cakes (like Mexican Chocolate, Lemon-Poppy, and Classic Red Velvet) plus icings and fondant, how-tos on cake construction, and information on necessary ingredients and tools. The truly extraordinary feature of the book is the gorgeous cake designs, which are organized by moodâ€”classical, classical whimsy, modern, and modern whimsy. These teach the reader foundational decorating techniques, like making sugar flowers, while inspiring bakers with photography that is gorgeous enough to stand on its own.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nEMILY LAEL AUMILLER is the founder and owner of Lael Cakes. Upon opening Lael Cakes and struggling with food allergies, Emily mastered recipes that cater to gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan clients who are in need of a high-end custom cake.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction\r\nRecipes &amp; Techniques\r\n1 Alternative Ingredients\r\n2 Tools to Have Handy\r\n3 Cake and Icing Recipes\r\n4 Cake Construction\r\n5 Working with Fondant, Sugar Paste, and Marzipan\r\nAspects of Cake Design\r\n6 Classical\r\n7 Classical Whimsy\r\n8 Modern\r\n9 Modern Whimsy\r\n10 Dessert Tables\r\nResources\r\nAcknowledgments\r\nIndex\r\n \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/om4kessv9/Pure_Artistry_Extraordinary_Vegan_and_Gluten_F.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec57768a4d19cf10a35681cc0792f255fb26df20","amp;dn":"Pure+Artistry+-+Extraordinary+Vegan+and+Gluten-Free+Cakes+%28gnv64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec57768a4d19cf10a35681cc0792f255fb26df20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,87,118,138,77,25,207,16,163,86,129,204,7,146,242,85,251,38,223,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
