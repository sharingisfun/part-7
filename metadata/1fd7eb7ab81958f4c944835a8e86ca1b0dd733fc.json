All life emerges from Ether and returns to it after death. It is the flow of Life and Death itself. You fought for dominance over this precious and powerful resource and claimed it for your own. A new threat emerges from the mists of Chaos, threatening the very fabric of existence. Heroes must be called from every corner of the land, armies trained,creatures summoned, and spells prepared. The war for Ether is rekindled and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to you to win the battle, not just for yourself but for existence itself.\n\nEtherlords 2 is an exciting mix of role-playing, adventure, and tactical combat in the fine tradition of fantasy trading card games. Rediscover the world of Ether and a whole new realm of fantastic possibilities. Lead your Hero through five campaigns, through lands filled with unsurpassed beauty and danger. Summon a wide variety of creatures--Lamia Warriors, Red Dragons, Walls of Air, and more--to help you achieve victory on the battlefield. Use all the power at your disposal to show your enemies that is you who deserves to have complete control of Ether. The Ether is eternal, the Ether is all-powerful, and now it will be under your command. If you're looking for a strategic challenge and you like trading-card games, this is your best pick!\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nAlan Wake American Nightmare\nGothic 3: Forsaken Gods Enhanced Edition\nSilent Hunter 2\nPolice Quest 1-2-3-4\nPrince of Persia 2008\nLionheart: Legacy of the Crusade\nBeyond Divinity\nStonekeep\nDeus Ex 2: Invisible War\nDriftmoon\nSilver\nRunaway series\nStill Life 2\nRunaway 1,2,3\nEador Master of the Broken\nA New Beginning - Final Cut\nThe Whispered World\nmyst masterpiece edition\ndreamfall series\nshogo\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nBioforge\nOmerta: City of Gangsters\nEdna &amp; Harvey: TB + HE\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fd7eb7ab81958f4c944835a8e86ca1b0dd733fc","amp;dn":"Etherlords+2+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fd7eb7ab81958f4c944835a8e86ca1b0dd733fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,215,235,122,184,25,88,244,201,68,131,90,142,134,202,27,13,215,51,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
