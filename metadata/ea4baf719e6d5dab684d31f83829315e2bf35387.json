Recorded seven months after the standard-setting Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Love SupremeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Transition's first half bears much in common with that groundbreaking set. Spiritually reaching and burningly intense, the quartet is playing at full steam, but still shy of the total free exploration that would follow mere months later on records like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sun ShipÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the mystical atonal darkness that came in the fall of that same year with Ã¢â‚¬Å“OmÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. All of the best parts of humanity are represented in this music. There is love, pain, epiphany, joy, sorrow, seeking, risk-taking, introspection. \n&quot;TransitionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is beyond jazz, beyond category - it is a music of awakening, a glorious window on the soul. \n\n\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\nTransition\n\nRecorded in 1965, released in 1970\n\n \n\n  CD / 1993 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
