When this book was first published, it was merely a simple volume of memoirs by an unknown Scottish veterinarian. But within a year, the book became recognized as a masterpiece. And in the three decades that followed, Dr. Herriot has become one of the most universally loved authors of our time.\n\nIn this first volume of memoirs, then-newly-qualified vet James Herriot arrives in the small Yorkshire village of Darrowby and he has no idea what to expect. How will he get on with his new boss? With the local farmers? And what will the animals think? This program is filled with hilarious and touching tales of the unpredictable Sigfriend Farnon, Sigfreid's zany brother, Tristan, and Herriot's first encounters with a beautiful girl called Helen.\n\nNow as then, All Creatures Great and Small is full of humor, warmth, pathos, drama, and James Herriot's love of life. His journey across the Yorkshire dales, and his encounters with humans and dogs, cows, and kittens are lovingly told by Christopher Timothy with all the fascination, affection, and joy that suffuses Dr. Herriot's work.\n\nSeries: All Creatures Great and Small\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Macmillan Audio; Unabridged edition (December 13, 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1559277734\nISBN-13: 978-1559277730\n\nChristopher Timothy (Reader)\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
