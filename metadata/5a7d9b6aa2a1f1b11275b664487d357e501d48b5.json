August 25, 1942), Bill Isles, Bobby Massey, William Powell (January 20, 1942-May 26, 1977) and Eddie Levert (b. June 16, 1942). The O'Jays were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004, and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. The O'Jays (now a trio after the departure of Isles and Massey) had their first hit with &quot;Lonely Drifter&quot;, in 1963. In spite of the record's success, the group was considering quitting the music business until Gamble &amp; Huff, a legendary team of producers and songwriters, took an interest in the group. With Gamble &amp; Huff, the O'Jays emerged at the forefront of Philadelphia soul with Back Stabbers (1972), a huge pop hit.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a7d9b6aa2a1f1b11275b664487d357e501d48b5","amp;dn":"The+O%5C%27Jays-11+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a7d9b6aa2a1f1b11275b664487d357e501d48b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,125,155,106,162,161,241,177,18,117,182,100,72,125,53,126,80,29,72,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
