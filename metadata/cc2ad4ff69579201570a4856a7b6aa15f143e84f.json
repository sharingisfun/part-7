First, the book places special emphasis on the connection between data structures and their algorithms, including an analysis of the algorithms' complexity. Second, the book presents data structures in the context of object-oriented program design, stressing the principle of information hiding in its treatment of encapsulation and decomposition. Finally, the book closely examines data structure implementation. Overall, this practical and theoretical book prepares students with a solid foundation in data structures for future courses and work in design implementation, testing, or maintenance of virtually any software system.\n\n\nISBN-10: 0534492525\n \nISBN-13: 9780534492526\n\n\nENJOY AND SEED!!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc2ad4ff69579201570a4856a7b6aa15f143e84f","amp;dn":"Data+Structures+and+Algorithms+in+Java%5B2nd+Ed%5D-2010kaiser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc2ad4ff69579201570a4856a7b6aa15f143e84f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,42,212,255,105,87,146,1,87,10,72,86,167,182,170,21,241,67,232,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
