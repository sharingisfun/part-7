The airport is also home to several cargo terminals and in 2000, DHL built its large Ã‚Â£35m cargo facility.\n\nThe arrival of low fares no frills carriers in 2002 meant a large increase in flights with BMIbaby and Ryanair. The arrivals hall has been extended and a new transport interchange has been created with a new pier built to reduce 'across tarmac' walking to aircraft.\n\nEast Midlands airport is the UK's largest cargo airport with DHL, TNT and UPS having bases there as well as being a primary hub for Royal Mail.\n\n \n\n    Full detail Buildings\n    Realistic Ground Markings\n    Hi Res ground image\n    UK Runway markings\n    Stunning Night Effects\n    3D Approach Lights\n    Dozens of Airport Vehicles\n    Excellent Frame Rates\n    Animated Traffic\n    Runway Wigwags\n    Full set of signs\n    Fencing\n    Static Aircraft\n    Manual and Options\n    Surrounding Docklands\n    Special 'Effects'\n    Improved runway lights\n    'Grass' effects\n    Museum Aircraft\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:546fd96308a92042cc93f96c5c2d28695c23e9dc","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+UK2000+Scenery+-+Nottingham+East+Midlands+Extreme+v1.02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"546fd96308a92042cc93f96c5c2d28695c23e9dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,111,217,99,8,169,32,66,204,147,249,108,92,45,40,105,92,35,233,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
