Lee, and Ulysses S. Grant) at Cherrywood Manor, which was a whorehouse at the time. This discovery allows Peter to buy back his home after selling the pictures to the tabloids.

He then brings the Pope back to his house, where His Holiness attempts to mediate his problems. Afterwards, Peter reconciles with Francis, who is hired for the job of working as the Pope's security guard during his tour of the United States, pushing down people who are not allowed to be near the Pope and those who are allowed to be near the Pope, but are in his way, including Fox personnel, much to the Pope's dismay.
