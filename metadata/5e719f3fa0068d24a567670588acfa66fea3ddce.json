Now, thanks to the persistence, dedication and collaboration of VLS (vanlose stairway) members and friends, this rare show has finally been assembled from the best sources available to us, complete as broadcast on Dutch FM radio. After 20+ years, we are sure fans will agree that it is about time! Better yet, we have also unearthed the 'raw audio source' of that set, taken from the live performance for a TV program called 'Wonderland' in Vara Studios, Hilversum, Netherlands. This audio has never before been circulated, and although available only in mono, it will surely delight the attentive listener.  (This is) a vanlose stairway production. Comments:  Disc 2 appears to have had some digital processing (like hiss reduction), there is a bit of digital swirl in the background.  A slight bit of non-digital static appears in a couple spots towards the end of Disc 2.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e719f3fa0068d24a567670588acfa66fea3ddce","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+%26amp%3B+Dr.+John+-+1977-06-22+-+Hilversum%2C+Netherland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e719f3fa0068d24a567670588acfa66fea3ddce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,113,159,63,160,6,141,36,165,103,103,5,136,172,250,102,254,163,221,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
