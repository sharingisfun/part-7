This was their first high profile concert in London after Led Zeppelin II displaced The Beatles' Abbey Road from the number one position in the charts and drew much attention. The band also understood its significance by professionally filming and recording with the intention of releasing it as a film later in the year. That plan was scrapped and the footage wouldn't be officially issued for another thirty-three years.     \r\n\r\nMore of this story contained in the main .nfo file","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a15471325f91cae77f02bb673ff7f80f102d0c97","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Live+Royal+Albert+Hall+1970+%28MP3-320%29+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a15471325f91cae77f02bb673ff7f80f102d0c97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,84,113,50,95,145,202,231,127,2,187,103,63,247,248,15,16,45,12,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
