As if that werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough, PITCHMAP provides functions to suppress individual sounds within a mix, and can apply advanced synthesizer-like sound transformations to your audio. In short, it is an inspiring musical instrument, a precision corrective tool and the only processor that literally lets you shape music with your hands.\n\nUNFILTER is a real-time plug-in that removes filtering effects, such as comb filtering, resonance, or excessive equalization ÃƒÂ¸ effectively linearizing the frequency response of a signal automatically. UNFILTER can also apply a detected filter response to another signal, or export it to disk as an impulse response, and can even perform mastering grade adaptive, free-form, and graphic equalization. Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in music production, film post, game audio, broadcast, sound design, forensics, or engineering ÃƒÂ¸ UNFILTER makes time-consuming and often impossible tasks as effortless as adjusting one control.\n\nUNVEIL is a real-time, de-mixing based plug-in that allows attenuating or boosting reverb components within a mixed signal of any channel count, including mono sources, as well as modifying reverb characteristics. Additionally, UNVEIL allows you to bring the key features of a recording into focus, or move them to the background, by attenuating or boosting perceptionally less important signal components. Based on our proprietary, artificial intelligence based MAP (Mixed-Signal Audio Processing) technology, UNVEIL allows fixing previously unusable location audio and dialog, tightening up live music recordings, removing reverb and ÃƒÂ¸mudÃƒÂ¸ from musical signals, as well as creative sound design.\n\n\n\n\nZYNAPTIQ Ã‚Â· PITCHMAP VERSION 1.2.0 Ã‚Â· OS X\n\nTypeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.: AUDIO PackagerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦: TEAM XFORCE\nPublisherÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..: ZYNAPTIQ CrackerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.: TEAM XFORCE\nSupplierÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦: TEAM XFORCE Release Date..: OCT 14TH 2013\n\nZYNAPTIQ Ã‚Â· UNFILTER VERSION 1.1.2 Ã‚Â· OS X\n\nTypeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.: AUDIO PackagerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦: TEAM XFORCE\nPublisherÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..: ZYNAPTIQ CrackerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.: TEAM XFORCE\nSupplierÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦: TEAM XFORCE Release Date..: OCT 14TH 2013\n\nZYNAPTIQ Ã‚Â· UNVEIL VERSION 1.7.2 Ã‚Â· OS X\n\nTypeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.: AUDIO PackagerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦: TEAM XFORCE\nPublisherÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..: ZYNAPTIQ CrackerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.: TEAM XFORCE\nSupplierÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦: TEAM XFORCE Release Date..: OCT 14TH 2013\n\nWhen so many groups bring you crap fakes non-working, X-FORCE always gets you the Best of the Best.
