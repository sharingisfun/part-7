Narrative art of Bohumil Hrabal and director skills of Jiri Menzel created one of the most poetic movies in Czech history. Pictures from lives of residents are framed by farce about two hunting factions warring for hunted boar and how they end up in a rousing, comic showdown. Fighting between two groups of man from neighboring villages runs through the whole film.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086319/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086319/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDvdRip\n\nLanguage: Czech\n\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, Portuguese_br, Serbian, Czech and Slovenian.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69b13c92de81716c767107e4a33c1ed650dfa2f9","amp;dn":"Slavnosti+snezenek+1984+The+Snowdrop+Festival+SUBS+DvdRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69b13c92de81716c767107e4a33c1ed650dfa2f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,177,60,146,222,129,113,108,118,113,7,228,163,60,30,214,80,223,162,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
