Characterized by an unusual experimental sound (a sound which Sakamoto and Noto will experiment also in Insen in 2005), it weaves an electronic minimalism spreading a very little amount of notes during the songs. The album was elected among the first 50 albums of 2003 by magazine The Wire[1]. Also named album of the year in 2004 by The Wire magazine.\n \nTrack listing\n\n1.&quot;Uoon I&quot; 13:51\n2.&quot;Uoon II&quot; 9:40\n3.&quot;Duoon&quot; 5:46\n4.&quot;Noon&quot; 10:13\n5.&quot;Trioon I&quot; 5:09\n6.&quot;Trioon II&quot; 9:57\n\nPersonnel\n\nRyuichi Sakamoto - piano\nAlva Noto - electronics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:121e35f071e832bf868e16e20035fcaa85fd7b84","amp;dn":"Alva+Noto+%26+Ryuichi+Sakamoto+%5B2002%5D+Vrioon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"121e35f071e832bf868e16e20035fcaa85fd7b84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,30,53,240,113,232,50,191,134,142,22,226,0,53,252,170,133,253,123,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
