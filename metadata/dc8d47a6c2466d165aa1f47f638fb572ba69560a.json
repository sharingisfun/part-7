It's absolutely incredible. From the first note it instills a beautiful peacefulness that is unmatched by any other music out there. The music is clean and has an immediate purifying effect. It is absolutely a pleasure to listen to actively or just let it fade into the background and relax the entire atmosphere. When this CD is on, I can completely melt into just being and enjoy every moment of it. It helps me meditate if I choose to, it helps me fall asleep if I choose to. I will also try to use it when needing to concentrate to study -- the effect of the music is so purifying and cleansing that it leaves you relaxed and refreshed and ready to face whatever comes your way. This was the first CD I bought by Steven Halpern, and it has impressed me so much I am now looking for all of his CDs. You won't regret buying this one!! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc8d47a6c2466d165aa1f47f638fb572ba69560a","amp;dn":"Chakra+Suite+-+Steven+Halpern","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc8d47a6c2466d165aa1f47f638fb572ba69560a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,141,71,166,194,70,109,22,90,161,244,127,99,143,181,114,186,105,86,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
