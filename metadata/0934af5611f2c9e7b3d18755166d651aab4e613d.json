RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Secu/Crap/EA\n1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Sports\n\n\nNote: This release is meant for our sites, its ops and users, and those who\nrequest it. We've labeled it internal because the DRM is bypassed using a\nloader. The game works, but it's not how we would usually release a crack\nA more proper way of cracking it exists, but would take extra time. The\nrules we follow also do not allow for loaders of this kind to be released,\nand it seems unlikely that new rules will come\n\nFIFA 13 captures all the drama and unpredictability of real-world\nsoccer, and is driven by five game-changing innovations which\nrevolutionize artificial intelligence, dribbling, ball control and\nphysical play. It is the largest and deepest feature set in the history\nof the franchise. These innovations create a true battle for possession\nacross the entire pitch, deliver freedom and creativity in attack, and\ncapture all the drama and unpredictability of the real-world game\n\nFEATURES\nAttacking Intelligence - Players have the ability to analyse space, work\nharder and smarter to break down the defense, and think two plays ahead\nPlus, players make runs that pull defenders out of position and open\npassing channels for teammates\n\nComplete Dribbling - Face your opponent and use precise dribble touches\ncombined with true 360-degree mobility with the ball. Be more creative\nand dangerous in 1v1 opportunities\n\n1st Touch Control - A new system transforms the way players control the\nball, eliminating near-perfect touch for every player, and creating more\nopportunities for defenders to capitalise on errant balls and poor\ntouches to win back possession\n\n\nInstall:\n\n1. Unrar\n2. Burn or mount the image\n3. Install the game\n4. Copy the cracked files from the Crack directory on the disc to the\ninstallGame directory, overwriting the existing exe\n5. Before you start the game, use your firewall to block all exe files in\nthe game's install directory from going online. Use the game setup\nbefore starting as well. It can be found in the following directory\ninstallGamefifasetup\n6. Play the game. While in game, avoid all of the online options. If you\nhave Origin installed, it may start it up. If that happens, ignore the\nprompt, play offline, and don't login\n7.
