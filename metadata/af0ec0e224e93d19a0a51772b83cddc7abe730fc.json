Well the battle is on, Patrick was going to kill this cheating usurper if it's the last thing he does!  However, Ryan is proving exceedingly hard to kill and Patrick's dog, Mars, proves to be no help at all!  \n\nDavid Hewlett, with his wife Jane Loughman and John Lenic,  wrote, produced, directed and acted in this dark comedy with all the panache he could beg, steal or borrow .  Absolutely, hysterically brilliant, a must-see movie for everyone!\n\nChristopher Judge (Teal'c from Stargate SG-1) and Rachel Luttrell (Teyla Emmagen from Stargate Atlantis) also guest star.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af0ec0e224e93d19a0a51772b83cddc7abe730fc","amp;dn":"A+Dog%5C%27s+Breakfast+David+Hewlett%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af0ec0e224e93d19a0a51772b83cddc7abe730fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,14,192,226,36,233,61,25,160,165,23,114,184,60,221,199,171,231,48,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
