At first, she just thinks he has gone off by himself for a few days - as he has done before - and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home.\n\nBut as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine's disappearance than his wife realises. The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous pen-portraits of almost everyone he knows. If the novel were published it would ruin lives - so there are a lot of people who might want to silence him.\n\nAnd when Quine is found brutally murdered in bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike any he has encountered before . . .\n\nA compulsively readable crime novel with twists at every turn, The Silkworm is the second in the highly acclaimed series featuring Cormoran Strike and his determined young assistant Robin Ellacott.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:257a75c05bcc7cf029107933be46fd7b333cce04","amp;dn":"The+Silkworm+-+Robert+Galbraith+-mp3%3Achapterized","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"257a75c05bcc7cf029107933be46fd7b333cce04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,122,117,192,91,204,124,240,41,16,121,51,190,70,253,123,51,60,206,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
