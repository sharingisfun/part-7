Furthermore, from the very beginning of human history this question for human nature was inextricably interwoven with the question for the nature of nature. A multi-perspective, transdisciplinary approach to these questions has to emphasise and structure the discourse between such different disciplines as socio-biology, morphology, evolutionary theory, ethics, philosophy of sciences and epistemology. On the basis of such considerations the EuropÃƒÂ¤ische Akademie organised in spring 1999 the symposium &quot;On Human Nature. Biological Approaches and Philosophical Reflections&quot;. The main results of this symposium, complemented by the approaches of invited authors, are presented in the current volume of the series &quot;Wissenschaftsethik und Technikfolgenbeurteilung&quot;. Thereby, the authors and the editors hope to invoke a comprehensive and inclusive discussion on a modern &quot;concept of humankind&quot;.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:748d6928ac19c7c67b82eacd766c9bb6f1bf6e54","amp;dn":"Gernot+Bohme+-+On+Human+Nature+%5B2002%5D%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"748d6928ac19c7c67b82eacd766c9bb6f1bf6e54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,141,105,40,172,25,199,198,123,130,234,205,118,108,155,182,241,191,110,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
