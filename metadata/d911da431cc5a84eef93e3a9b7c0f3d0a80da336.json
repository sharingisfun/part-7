Comus' first album contains an imaginative if elusive brand of experimental folk-rock, with a tense and sometimes distressed vibe. Although there are elements of traditional British folk music, there's an edginess to the songwriting &amp;amp; arrangements that would be entirely alien in a Fairport Convention or Pentangle disc. At times, this straddles the border between folk-rock and the kind of songs you'd expect to be sung at a witches' brew fest, the haunting supernatural atmosphere enhanced by bursts of what sound like a theramin-like violin, hand drums, flute, oboe, ghostly female backup vocals, and detours into almost tribal rhythms.\n\nAnother of my fave albums. Fist time I heard it was on head  phones and it scared the shit out of me! Haha. From what I have been told their second album is poor in comparison. Enjoy!\nBrainticket\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d911da431cc5a84eef93e3a9b7c0f3d0a80da336","amp;dn":"Comus+-+First+Utterance+%28UK+Psych-Folk+1971%29+%28192%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d911da431cc5a84eef93e3a9b7c0f3d0a80da336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,17,218,67,28,197,168,78,239,147,227,169,183,192,243,208,168,13,163,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
