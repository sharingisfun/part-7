Nothing is a problem.&quot;\nSting says &quot;First and foremost, he's a musician. He's a drummer...I think when you're dealing with artists as a musician, you don't need to push your weight around...you have a quiet confidence that's about having mastered an instrument...I always feel he treats us as fellow musicians, rather than pieces in his business game.&quot;\nA drummer from Ottawa and the son of a former Montreal Alouette, Arthur Fogel rose through the ranks of the concert promotions business in Canada to become the most successful international tour producer in the world. As CEO of Global Touring and Chairman of Global Music for LIVE NATION, he is also, arguably, the most trusted man in music. With his personal, &quot;hands-on&quot; approach and masterful knowledge of world touring, Fogel has overseen the most profitable mega-tours in history, building lucrative partnerships with an elite group of artists including Madonna, U2, The Police, Lady Gaga, Rush, David Bowie and more.\nKnown for his low-key style and steadfast relationships, Fogel is both a veteran of the game and a pioneer, determining the way the industry is evolving in the 21st century. As recording artists increasingly rely on live performance and merchandising for the majority of their income, Fogel has established a formula for consistently delivering top-grossing tours for icons like Madonna and U2, that have seen their revenues skyrocket under his visionary direction.\n&quot;Who the F**K is Arthur Fogel?&quot; is a fascinating look at the world of a quiet man at the centre of the high octane global music industry industry.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7b33121c133b374f554a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 1981 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 104mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.55 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://whothefisarthurfogel.com/\n\n2)  Related Documentaries \n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=How%20Music%20Works\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Music%20is%20the%20Weapon\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Music%20Videos%20That%20Shaped%20The%2080s\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Birth%20of%20British%20Music\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03c0b67bfb3af11825ed484194512605eca9029","amp;dn":"Who.The.FUCK.is.Arthur.Fogel.2013.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC..mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03c0b67bfb3af11825ed484194512605eca9029","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,60,11,103,191,179,175,17,130,94,212,132,25,69,18,96,94,202,144,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
