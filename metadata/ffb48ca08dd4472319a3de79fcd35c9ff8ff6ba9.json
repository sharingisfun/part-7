The depth of knowledge this book contains pres the link between you,the practitoner of yoga and an experienced guide and teacher.This link is your sadhana(spiritual practice),the beginning of your inner transformation,spiritual awakening and realization of higher ideals in life. The techniques covered in this book have their basis in the ancient vedic (tantric and yogic) shastras and were handed over the centuries from guru to disciple. Now in an age when travel and communication have become almost instantaneous affairs and there are more efficient methods of disseminating wisdom than the human voice and ear,we wish to offer these transcendatal instruments of grace to all who have eyes to read and ears to hear.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffb48ca08dd4472319a3de79fcd35c9ff8ff6ba9","amp;dn":"Best+book+on+Yoga+%26+Meditation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffb48ca08dd4472319a3de79fcd35c9ff8ff6ba9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,180,140,160,141,212,71,35,25,163,222,121,252,211,92,159,248,255,107,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
