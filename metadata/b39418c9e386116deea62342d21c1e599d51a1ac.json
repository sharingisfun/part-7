How about As American as freshly baked bread?. Before we became reliant on massed-produced supermarket loaves, The United States had a rich history of homemade bread recipes, from flaky and light Southern biscuits to hearty Boston Brown Bread -not to mention the uniquely tangy San Francisco Sourdough. Adrienne Kane has unearthed these vintage recipes, given them a modern twist where appropriate, and collected them all in United States of Bread. Both novices and experienced bakers can delight in these American favorites, including Pullman Loaves, Amish Dill, Cinnamon Raisin Swirl, New York Flatbread, Wild Rice Bread Stuffing, and lots more. United States of Bread is a charming collection that will inspire everyone to get in the kitchen to celebrate AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home-baking legacy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b39418c9e386116deea62342d21c1e599d51a1ac","amp;dn":"United+States+of+Bread+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b39418c9e386116deea62342d21c1e599d51a1ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,148,24,201,227,134,17,109,238,166,35,66,210,28,30,89,157,81,161,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
