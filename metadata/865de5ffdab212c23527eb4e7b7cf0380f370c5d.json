But when Deutsch, a wealthy magazine and newpaper publisher, starts thinking seriously about his impending death, he offers to pay a physicist and two mediums, one physical and one mental, $100,000 each to establish the facts of life after death. Dr. Lionel Barrett, the physicist, accompanied by the mediums, travel to the Belasco House in Maine, which has been abandoned and sealed since 1949 after a decade of drug addiction, alcoholism, and debauchery. For one night, Barrett and his colleagues investigate the Belasco House and learn exactly why the townfolks refer to it as the Hell House.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:865de5ffdab212c23527eb4e7b7cf0380f370c5d","amp;dn":"Hell+House+-+Richard+Matheson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"865de5ffdab212c23527eb4e7b7cf0380f370c5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,93,229,255,218,178,18,194,53,39,235,78,123,124,240,56,15,55,12,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
