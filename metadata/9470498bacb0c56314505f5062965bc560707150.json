He was known as King of the Slide Guitar but he was also noted for his use of loud amplification and his stirring voice. \n\n'... Watching Elmore sing and play, backed by a solid blues band (Homesick James, J.T. Brown, Boyd Atkins and Sam Cassell) made me feel real fine. Wearing thick glasses, Elmore's face always had an expressive and dramatic look, especially when he was real gone on the slow blues. Singing with a strong and rough voice, he really didn't need a mike. On such slow blues as I'm Worried - Make My Dreams Come True - It Hurts Me, his voice reached a climax and created a tension that was unmistakably the down and out blues. Notwithstanding that raw voice, Elmore sang his blues with a particular feeling, an emotion and depth that showed his country background. His singing was... fed, reinforced by his own guitar accompaniment which was as rough, violent and expressive as was his voice. Using the bottleneck technique most of the time, Elmore really let his guitar sound as I had never heard a guitar sound before. You just couldn't sit still! You had to move...'\n(George Adins see James play in Chicago in 1959)\n\n- - -\n\nElmore James - Big Box of Elmore James\n(6CD Floating World Records 2012)\n\nDisc 1 \n 1.
