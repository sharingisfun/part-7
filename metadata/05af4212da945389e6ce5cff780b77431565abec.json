Bejan explores controversial and relevant issues such as sustainability, water and food supply, fuel, and economy, to critique the state in which the world understands positions of power and freedom. Breaking down concepts such as desire and power, sports health and culture, the state of economy, water and energy, politics and distribution, Bejan uses the language of physics to explain how each system works in order to clarify the meaning of evolution in its broadest scientific sense, moving the reader towards a better understanding of the world's systems and the natural evolution of cultural and political development.\r\n\r\n&quot;The Physics of Life &quot;argues that the evolution phenomenon is much broader and older than the evolutionary designs that constitute the biosphere, empowering readers with a new view of the globe and the future, revealing that the urge to have better ideas has the same physical effect as the urge to have better laws and better government. This is evolution explained loudly but also elegantly, forging a path that flows sustainability","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05af4212da945389e6ce5cff780b77431565abec","amp;dn":"The+Physics+of+Life+-+The+Evolution+of+Everything+%282016%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05af4212da945389e6ce5cff780b77431565abec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,175,66,18,218,148,83,137,230,206,92,255,120,11,119,67,21,101,171,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
