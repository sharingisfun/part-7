Using California hardcore as a foundation, the group incorporated funk-metal and skatepunk into its sound, developing into something that functioned as edgy, post-punk frat rock -- it was speedy and occasionally stupidly catchy, with heavy, propulsive rhythms and positive, optimistic lyrics that stood in pointed contrast to their grunge-addled peers. Through constant touring and recording, as well as appearances at surfing and snowboarding concerts and in videos, Pennywise developed a dedicated following among post-hardcore punk audiences, and were positioned to follow Bad Religion, Green Day, and the Offspring into the modern rock mainstream, but internal problems, culminating in the 1996 suicide of founding bassist Jason Thirsk, prevented the band from being anything bigger than a popular cult band in the vein of NOFX. \n\n\nGenre................: Alternative-Rock\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\n01.What You Deserve\n02.Restless Time\n03.Noise Pollution\n04.Violence Never Ending\n05.Am Oi!\n06.Thanksgiving\n07.She's A Winner\n08.Slow Down\n09.Public Defender\n10.No Way Out\n11.I Can Remember\n12.Band Practice 89\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a3030e5a88b19b551879d92c875cbaedee27ebd","amp;dn":"Pennywise+-+Yesterdays+%282014%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a3030e5a88b19b551879d92c875cbaedee27ebd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,48,48,229,168,139,25,181,81,135,157,146,200,117,203,174,222,226,126,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
