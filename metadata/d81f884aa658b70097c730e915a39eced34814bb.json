This second time out, his tight, raw trio bristling behind him, his vocal roar remains less weathered, though he deliberately, momentarily evokes Waylon on &quot;Some Rowdy Women,&quot; the darkly futile &quot;Hair of the Dog,&quot; and &quot;Little White Lines,&quot; a fearful, foreboding tale of cocaine abuse. His reflective, vulnerable side emerges on the sorrowful &quot;The Song Is Slipping Away&quot; and the painfully contrite ballad &quot;Aviators.&quot; Sly humor drives a revival of Hank Williams Jr.&amp;#039;s &quot;Living Proof&quot; that begins by paying homage to the original, luring the listener into momentarily believing that Jennings, too, is desperate to free himself from a famous daddy&amp;#039;s shadow. It is, of course, a brilliant fake-out. Near the song&amp;#039;s end, he and the band flip right into the famous instrumental vamp Waylon used on so many of his hits, a wise-assed move worthy of Waylon himself.\n  \n \n\nInformation Disc:\n?
