It is a lonely job, and a thankless one for the most part. Until something goes wrong. Until a ship is in distress.\r\n\r\nIn the 23rd century, this job has moved into outer space. A network of beacons allows ships to travel across the Milky Way at many times the speed of light. These beacons are built to be robust. They never break down. They never fail.\r\n\r\nAt least, they arenâ€™t supposed to. \r\n\r\nThis work contains the five Beacon 23 stories, originally released in serialized form. \r\n\r\n\r\nNarrated by: Ryan McCarthy\r\nLength: 6 hrs and 6 mins \r\nFormat: M4A\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:10-20-15\r\nPublisher: Broad Reach Publishing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9a83301f64c9efbfe7788db3eddf32e030d4481","amp;dn":"Hugh+Howey+-+Beacon+23+-+The+Complete+Novel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9a83301f64c9efbfe7788db3eddf32e030d4481","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,168,51,1,246,76,158,251,254,119,136,219,62,221,243,46,3,13,68,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
