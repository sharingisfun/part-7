Entering a windowless room, an Invigilator gives them eighty minutes to answer one simple question. He outlines three rules they must obey or be disqualified: don't talk to him or the armed guard by the door, don't spoil their papers and don't leave the room. He starts the clock and leaves. The candidates turn over their question papers, only to find they're completely blank. After the initial confusion has subsided, one frustrated candidate writes 'I believe you should hire me because...,' and is promptly ejected for spoiling. The remaining candidates soon figure out they're permitted to talk to each other, and they agree to cooperate in order to figure out the question: then they can compete to answer it. At first they suspect the question may be hidden in their papers like a security marker in a credit card, and they figure out ways to change their environment to expose the hidden words. But light, liquids and other plans all come to naught. Soon enough, the candidates begin to uncover each other's background, prejudices and hidden agendas. Tensions rise as the clock steadily descends towards zero, and each candidate must decide how far they are willing to go to secure the ultimate job.\n\nVideo: ID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP : No\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 34mn\nBit rate : 860 Kbps\nWidth : 640 pixels\nHeight : 296 pixels\n\nAudio: ID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 34mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 122 Kbps\n\nDuration:1:34\nLanguage:English\n\ncredit Xclusive666 BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2246ef4d1d68ec7512de7133cc9742cb2b6a6472","amp;dn":"Exam+2009+DVDRip+XviD+LKRG%5BExtraTorrent%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2246ef4d1d68ec7512de7133cc9742cb2b6a6472","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,70,239,77,29,104,236,117,18,222,113,51,204,151,66,203,43,106,100,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
