In order to repair his tarnished image, Dax publicly agrees to grant a fan's &quot;Dear Santa&quot; Christmas wish. To his dismay, his manager Jason (Matt Ward) drops Dax off in Cedar Grove, a Midwest small town, where he's committed to spend a week and perform in a local holiday Christmas concert.\n\nAt first, Dax is horrified to be stuck in the Reverend Harding (Peter Lacroix) family's home with strict rules and a curfew. In spite of himself, he soon becomes charmed by the Reverend's wife Lynne (Ellie Harvie), and very surprised contest winner and daughter Kelly (Mackenzie Porter), a sassy, unemployed book jacket writer.\n\nBetween the family's backyard collection of llamas, quirky Christmas traditions and their overall kindness, Dax starts to appreciate what the Hardings have as a family Ã¢â‚¬â€œ love, caring and an uplifting holiday spirit. Olivia Cheng also stars. The movie features a musical duet by Lachey and Porter, entitled &quot;You.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 08-Dec-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1762419e2b2edd91dc6ad7227a0ad88bfc49aab","amp;dn":"Guess.Whos.Coming.to.Christmas.2013.UPtv.DSR.x264-W4F.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1762419e2b2edd91dc6ad7227a0ad88bfc49aab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,118,36,25,226,178,237,217,29,198,173,114,39,160,173,136,191,196,154,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
