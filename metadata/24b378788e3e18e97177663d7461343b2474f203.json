He studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma and in the 1940s he began devoting himself to painting in a studio at Via del Babuino in central Rome. He began to develop a distinct style stemming from impressions of life, nature, and the Mediterranean, impressions which abstractly reflect themselves in the purely vivid and passionate colors of his work. Simbari's originality and commercial appeal brought his art to exhibitions in London and New York by the 1950s, solidifying his international reputation.\n\nNicola Simbari is considered by many to be Italy's most important living artist. He is a semiabstract impressionist. Using stunning colors and favoring brilliant tones, He paints with a palette knife and achieves great depth with this technique. Simbari's paintings are full of light and energy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24b378788e3e18e97177663d7461343b2474f203","amp;dn":"Nicola+Simbari+%281927+-+2012%29+%28Art+Paintings%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24b378788e3e18e97177663d7461343b2474f203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,179,120,120,142,62,24,233,113,119,102,61,116,97,52,59,36,116,242,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
