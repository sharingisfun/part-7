You are the\r\n Inquisitor, tasked with saving the world from itself. But the road\r\n ahead is paved with difficult decisions. Thedas is a land of strife.\r\n Factions constantly war with each other even as a larger demonic\r\n invasion has begun. And you? You and your band of champions are the\r\n only ones who can hold it together. It's your job to lead theme or fall.\r\n And with the Digital Deluxe, you're granted access to an exclusive\r\n armory of weapons, armor and mounts. Sit atop the skull-carved throne\r\n with the Flames of the Inquisition Armor, and ride onto the battlefield\r\n with mounts like the Bog Unicorn and the Red Hart Halla.\r\n You're not just deciding who to send into which battle in Inquisition,\r\n you're making important decisions that shape the future of Thedas. Each\r\n choice carries weight, and your actions can lead to a variety of outcomes.\r\n Inquisition is a highly personalized journey, where one wrong move could\r\n set in motion a series of events that alter the physical aspects of the\r\n world itself, making your Thedas - and your heroes - feel truly unique.\r\n The world of Thedas has never been bigger or more detailed; it's wide\r\n open, and ripe for exploration. Discover enemy keeps ripe for the taking.\r\n Unearth hidden caves filled with lurking creatures. Thedas is vast and\r\n dangerous, but uncovering its secrets can spell the difference between\r\n victory and defeat.\r\n There's no wrong way to play Dragon Age: Inquisition, except for the way\r\n that gets you killed. Fortunately, the optional strategic view gives you\r\n a god's-eye vantage on battle. Time stops while you plan in this view,\r\n but if that's not your style, you can just barrel ahead, crossbows blazing.\r\n \r\n Instructions: \r\n \r\n -Burn or mount the image\r\n -Install the game\r\n -Copy the crack\r\n -Enjoy\r\n \r\n Note:\r\n\r\n The game is updated to the latest patch and it contains all DLCs, OST included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8729b373d2fb12f99cc742785e219ed557158048","amp;dn":"Dragon.Age.Inquisition.Deluxe.Edition.Crack.Only-CPY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8729b373d2fb12f99cc742785e219ed557158048","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,41,179,115,210,251,18,249,156,199,66,120,94,33,158,213,87,21,128,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
