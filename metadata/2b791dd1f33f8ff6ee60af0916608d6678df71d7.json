Thomas Magstadt's book gives due attention to contemporary political issues and calls attention to the more enduring underlying questions. With its strong, engaging &quot;politics are pertinent&quot; theme and current, cutting-edge coverage, the Tenth Edition fascinates students with its coverage of three fundamental premises: 1) politics is a pervasive force in modern society; 2) government is too important to be left in the hands of a few; and 3) everyone has both the opportunity and the obligation to participate in public life in a democracy. The Tenth Edition focuses on such vital concepts as democracy, dictatorship, citizenship, voting behavior, elections, leadership, ideologies, war, revolution, world politics, and public policy.\n\nAbout the Author\nThomas Magstadt earned his doctorate at the Johns Hopkins Schools of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).
