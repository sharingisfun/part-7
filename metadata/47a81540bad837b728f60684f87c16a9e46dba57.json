He triesâ€”and failsâ€”to flee. Left alone with his increasingly deranged parent, he dreams of safety, of joining the other children in the town below, of escape.\r\n\r\nWhen at last a stranger knocks at his door, the boy senses that his days of isolation might be over.\r\n\r\nBut by what authority does this man keep the meticulous records he carries? What is the purpose behind his questions? Is he friend? Enemy? Or something else altogether?\r\n\r\nFilled with beauty, terror, and strangeness, This Census-Taker is a poignant and riveting exploration of memory and identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Matthew Frow\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47a81540bad837b728f60684f87c16a9e46dba57","amp;dn":"China+Mieville+-+This+Census-Taker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47a81540bad837b728f60684f87c16a9e46dba57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,168,21,64,186,216,55,183,40,246,6,132,248,124,22,169,228,109,186,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
