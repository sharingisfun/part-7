YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn techniques for object recognition, 3D reconstruction, stereo imaging, augmented reality, and other computer vision applications as you follow clear examples written in Python.\n\nProgramming Computer Vision with Python explains computer vision in broad terms that wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bog you down in theory. You get complete code samples with explanations on how to reproduce and build upon each example, along with exercises to help you apply what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned. This book is ideal for students, researchers, and enthusiasts with basic programming and standard mathematical skills.\n\nLearn techniques used in robot navigation, medical image analysis, and other computer vision applications\nWork with image mappings and transforms, such as texture warping and panorama creation\nCompute 3D reconstructions from several images of the same scene\nOrganize images based on similarity or content, using clustering methods\nBuild efficient image retrieval techniques to search for images based on visual content\nUse algorithms to classify image content and recognize objects\nAccess the popular OpenCV library through a Python interface","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cfc1ea767f51b6a231c4c7170c74f3a7cfcb8e2","amp;dn":"Programming+Computer+Vision+with+Python","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cfc1ea767f51b6a231c4c7170c74f3a7cfcb8e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,252,30,167,103,245,27,106,35,28,76,113,112,199,79,58,124,252,184,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
