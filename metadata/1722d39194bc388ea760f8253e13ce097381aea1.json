'The waiting is over. Tomorrow there will be no dawn. Only midnight, absolute and eternal.'Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAnd so begins a new chapter in the epic story of 16-year-old Candy Quackenbush and her journeys through the world of the Abarat, where every hour is an island in one eternal day, and nothing is as it seems.\n\nCandy travels through the Abarat from island to island and across the sea with an unlikely band of friends: the escaped prisoner Malingo the Geshrat; the quarrelsome John Brothers, who all share the same body but never the same opinion; and the many other colorful characters they meet along the way.\n\nThe problem is that trouble finds Candy wherever she goes. And soon she discovers a secret plot, masterminded by the diabolical Mater Motley, who is obsessed with becoming Empress of the Islands. Her method is simple. She will darken the skies, putting out the suns, moons, and stars. She will bring absolute midnight.\n\nThis is one of my favorite series. Splitting this one into chapters was a project I put a lot of love into. I really hope ya'll enjoy these three","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1722d39194bc388ea760f8253e13ce097381aea1","amp;dn":"+Absolute+Midnight+-+Clive+Barker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1722d39194bc388ea760f8253e13ce097381aea1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,34,211,145,148,188,56,142,167,96,248,37,62,19,206,9,115,129,174,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
