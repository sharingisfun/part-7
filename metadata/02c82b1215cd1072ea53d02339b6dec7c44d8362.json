Atlas' Marker 5:57\n\nFive years after the disappointing The Magazine, Rickie Lee Jones\nreturned to form with Flying Cowboys, which shared much of the playful,\nchildlike charm of her debut, Rickie Lee Jones, and some of the\nmusically diffuse, lyrically ambitious form of its follow-up, Pirates.\n\nFrom the opening track, &quot;The Horses,&quot; which suggested a mother's delight\nwith her child as much as a lover's devotion, Jones reintroduced the\njoyous tone of her early work as well as establishing the Western theme\nthat would run through the album -- cowboys, rodeos, horses, deserts --\nwithout adding up to an actual storyline. The easy rhythms and lazy,\nflexible singing on the first few songs were reminiscent of Laura Nyro's\nwork with Labelle on their Gonna Take a Miracle album, after which Jones\nbranched out into reggae and folk-blues, coming up with an affectionate\nbluesman voice on &quot;Ghost Train.&quot;\n\n&quot;Satellites,&quot; the college radio hit, used the sprung rhythms and\nsurprising choral parts familiar from her popular early songs. If Jones\ncould be obscure and unfocused as a writer, that weakness was also her\nstrength, since it was an expression of the imagination that also\nproduced her most striking musical effects.\n\nProducer Walter Becker may have helped keep things from getting as\ngrandiose as they had on The Magazine, but it was really the artist\nherself who managed to rein in from that album's self-importance. If\nwhat resulted was not as accomplished as Pirates, it was the most\naccessible and enjoyable music Jones had made since her debut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02c82b1215cd1072ea53d02339b6dec7c44d8362","amp;dn":"Rickie+Lee+Jones+-+Flying+Cowboys+%5B1989%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02c82b1215cd1072ea53d02339b6dec7c44d8362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,200,43,18,21,205,16,114,234,83,208,35,57,182,222,199,196,77,131,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
