Edited by Eric L. Santner.\n\nISBN: 0826403336 | 345 pages | Bilingual edition | PDF\n\n\nFRIEDRICH HÃƒâ€“LDERLIN (1770-1843) was a major Romantic lyric poet and important thinker in the development of German Idealism.  His poetry exerted a deep influence on later German poets such as Georg Trakl, Rainer Maria Rilke, Hermann Hesse and Paul Celan.\n\nIn this volume, part of the German Library series, editor Eric L. Santner has collected a who's who of HÃƒÂ¶lderlin translators.  The centerpiece is Willard R. Trask's 1965 complete translation of the epistolary novel &quot;Hyperion, or the Hermit in Greece&quot; (1797-1799).  The generous selection of poems is translated by Christopher Middleton, Michael Hamburger, and Richard Sieburth.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cba3962ccef7ce155ba7c2d866d1c72b67b1360d","amp;dn":"Friedrich+Holderlin+-+Hyperion+%26amp%3B+Selected+Poems+%281990%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cba3962ccef7ce155ba7c2d866d1c72b67b1360d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,163,150,44,206,247,206,21,91,167,194,216,102,209,199,43,103,177,54,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
