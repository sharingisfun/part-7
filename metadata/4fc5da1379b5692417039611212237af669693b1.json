Stimulating and fun, these logic puzzles, mind-benders, mathematical teasers, and conundrums are a must-have for anyone serious about reaching his or her full potential. And they're compiled by two of MENSA's leading puzzle editors who really know something about giving the brain a workout. Each of the 20 sections contains 25 puzzles; no specialist knowledge is required to answer the questions, and hard and easy ones are randomly mixed. Solve them using standard mathematical or alphabetical calculations. (Some tables up front--including a multiplication table and lists of square, cube, and prime numbers--offer a little extra help for those in need.) Here's an example of just one brain-baffling challenge","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fc5da1379b5692417039611212237af669693b1","amp;dn":"Discover+Your+IQ+Potential%3A+Unlock+the+Power+of+Your+Mind-Mantes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fc5da1379b5692417039611212237af669693b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,197,218,19,121,181,105,36,23,3,150,17,33,34,55,175,102,150,147,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
