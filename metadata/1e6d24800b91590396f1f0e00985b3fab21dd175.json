For decades, that question has fascinated a small circle of impassioned doctors and researchersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and now, their life-changing research is making headlines in the hit documentary Forks Over Knives.\n\nTheir answer? Eat a whole-foods, plant-based dietÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½it could save your life. It may overturn most of the diet advice youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve heardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but the experts behind Forks Over Knives aren't afraid to make waves. In his book Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn explained that eating meat, dairy, and oils injures the lining of our blood vessels, causing heart disease, heart attack, or stroke.\n\nIn The China Study, Dr. Colin Campbell revealed how cancer and other diseases skyrocket when eating meat and dairy is the normÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and plummet when a traditional plant-based diet persists. And more and more experts are adding their voices to the cause: There is nothing else you can do for your health that can match the benefits of a plant-based diet.\nNow, as Forks Over Knives is introducing more people than ever before to the plant-based way to health, this accessible guide provides the information you need to adopt and maintain a plant-based diet. Features include:\nInsights from the luminaries behind the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Dr. Neal Barnard, Dr. John McDougall, The Engine 2 Diet author Rip Esselstyn, and many others\nSuccess stories from converts to plant-based eatingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½like SanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Dera Prude, who no longer needs to medicate her diabetes, has lost weight, and feels great!\nThe many benefits of a whole-foods, plant-based dietÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for you, for animals and the environment, and for our future\nA helpful primer on crafting a healthy diet rich in unprocessed fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, including tips on transitioning and essential kitchen tools\n125 recipes from 25 champions of plant-based diningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from Blueberry Oat Breakfast Muffins and Sunny Orange Yam Bisque to Garlic Rosemary Polenta and Raspberry-Pear CrispÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½delicious, healthy, and for every meal, every day.\n\n\n\n====================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e6d24800b91590396f1f0e00985b3fab21dd175","amp;dn":"Simple%2C+Satisfying+Recipes+and+Menus+%2B+Healthy+and+Fit+on+a+Plan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e6d24800b91590396f1f0e00985b3fab21dd175","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,109,36,128,11,145,89,3,150,241,240,224,9,133,179,250,178,29,209,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
