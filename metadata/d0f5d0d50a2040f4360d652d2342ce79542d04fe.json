His tight circle of musicians was still creating a brand of R&amp;B as distinct as it was influential. (You can hear it in the music of artists as disparate as Nigeria&amp;#039;s Fela and Germany&amp;#039;s Can.) But on his home turf, James was already competing with post-Superfly wah-wah pedal hoppers and the pre-disco Philly sound. So it&amp;#039;s not surprising that he soaked up loose change from his pre-sold followers with cut-&amp;#039;n-press JB&amp;#039;s albums like this one on his indie label, People.\n\nThough composed by bandleader Fred Wesley and a bigger hit than any single released by James under his own name that year, the talky 10-minute title cut is still pure Godfather. And the unexpectedly solid album constructed around it is every bit a classically Jamesian combination of loose lip and tight ship. The boss man&amp;#039;s mug is missing from the sleeve, but if there&amp;#039;s any doubt who&amp;#039;s in charge, just listen to the way he introduces the bass solo on &quot;More Peas,&quot; relinquishing the groove only after giving the band notice that &quot;if he lose the funk we gotta chunk him out.&quot;\n\nThe theme song, &quot;You Can Have Watergate Just Gimme Some Bucks and I&amp;#039;ll Be Straight,&quot; is ironic given James&amp;#039; re-election endorsement of the vulnerable funky president. JB had hoped to pressure Nixon for a Martin Luther King holiday (&quot;You can&amp;#039;t change a house from the outside,&quot; he&amp;#039;d told hecklers at the Apollo). By &amp;#039;73, he just wanted his 40 acres. Instead, he got a call from the IRS and belated thanks &quot;for inventing modern music&quot; some 23 years later&quot;. Peter S. Scholtes\n\n\n\n&quot;An incredible album -- a landmark piece of funk that nobody should be without, funk fan or not! The album is the second to feature James Brown&amp;#039;s famous backing combo of the early 70s -- and unlike their first one, which was really more of a collection of singles, this album has the group playing hard, long, and loud, in the free funk improvisational mode that was James&amp;#039; real contribution to the music at the time. The tracks are all long, with James at the forefront, egging the band on with shouts and comments -- but also letting them open up large instrumentally, playing in a mode that&amp;#039;s as much jazz as it is funky soul. The whole thing&amp;#039;s peppered with some nice shorter seques between tracks -- but the long cuts are the winners, and are some of the best funk ever recorded&quot; (Dusty Groove America)\n\n\n\n1 - Introduction to the J.B.&amp;#039;s (0:23)\n2 - Doing it to Death - Parts 1 &amp; 2 (9:49)\n3 - You Can Have Watergate Just Gimme Some Bucks and I&amp;#039;ll Be Straight (0:14)\n4 - More Peas (8:16)\n5 - La Di Da La Di Day (5:32)\n6 - You Can Have Watergate Just Gimme Some Bucks and I&amp;#039;ll Be Straight (0:14)\n7 - Sucker (8:00)\n8 - You Can Have Watergate Just Gimme Some Bucks and I&amp;#039;ll Be Straight (6:22)\n\n\nJames Brown - lead vocal\nFred Wesley - trombone\nDarryl &quot;Hasaan&quot; Jamison - trumpet\nJerone &quot;Jasaan&quot; Sanford - trumpet\nIke Oakley - trumpet\nSt. Clair Pinckney - tenor saxophone\nEldee Williams - tenor saxophone\nJohn &quot;Jabo&quot; Starks - drums\nJimmy Nolen - guitar\nHearlon &quot;Cheese&quot; Martin - guitar\nFred Thomas - bass\nMaceo Parker - alto saxophone\n\nLabel: Polydor\nReleased: 1972\n\nP.S.
