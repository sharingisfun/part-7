Built on 15 years of virtualization excellence and winner of more than 50 industry awards, VMware Workstation Pro takes desktop virtualization to the next level by giving users an unmatched operating system support, rich user experience and incredible performance.\r\n\r\nVMware Workstation Pro takes advantage of the latest hardware to replicate server, desktop and tablet environments in a virtual machine. Run applications on a breadth of operating systems including Linux, Windows and more at the same time on the same PC without rebooting. VMware Workstation Pro makes it really easy to evaluate new operating systems like Windows 10, test software applications and patches, and reference architectures in an isolated and safe environment. No other desktop virtualization software offers the performance, reliability and cutting edge features of Workstation Pro.\r\n\r\nWith the ability to allocate multiple processor cores, gigabytes of main memory, and graphics memory to each virtual machine, Workstation Pro maximizes your computerâ€™s resources to run the most demanding applications in a virtual environment. Workstation Pro even lets you run virtual ESXi hosts and vSphere appliances, letting you create an entire Software Defined Data Center right on your desktop.\r\n\r\nSeamlessly access all the virtual machines you need, regardless of where they reside, from the PC to the cloud. Simply drag and drop to move your virtual machines from your PC to the private cloud with VMware vSphere or the public cloud with vCloud Air. By leveraging the hybrid cloud you are no longer constrained by the power of your PC and can quickly migrate and scale your workloads to the cloud while reducing complexity and maintaining compatibility.\r\n\r\nWorkstation Pro gives technical professionals powerful controls over how to set up and interact with virtual machines. Choose from a wide variety of options for installing, protecting, connecting, sharing and viewing virtual machines to save valuable time. You can even create virtual machines that are encrypted, require a change of password and expire at a predefined date and time. Use the virtual network editor to build up to 20 custom virtual networks for connected multi-tier applications. Leverage the Snapshot feature to preserve the state of a virtual machine so you can return to it at any time.\r\n\r\nSharing a virtual machine is the quickest way to share and test applications with your team in a more production like environment. Run VMware Workstation Pro as a server to share a repository of pre-loaded virtual machines in every desired configuration with your teammates, department or organization. VMware Workstation Pro provides enterprise caliber control over user access when sharing virtual machines.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1feb8e686400c87a6cb77452cb9592724665d4ad","amp;dn":"VMware+Workstation+Pro+12.1.0.3272444+Incl+keygen-%3DTEAM+OS%3D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1feb8e686400c87a6cb77452cb9592724665d4ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,235,142,104,100,0,200,122,108,183,116,82,203,149,146,114,70,101,212,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
