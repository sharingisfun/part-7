US-BASED WINDOWS/XP/VISTA USERS MAY EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS READING VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE CHARACTERS. PLEASE LOAD THE LCF FILE - DO NOT EXTRACT THE LIBRARY. THE LCF WILL PROTECT MS FROM SEEING THE OFFENDING CHARACTERS. ENJOY!!\n\n\nAs many of you may know, Graphisoft has an international program whereby library content is localized for many of the countries that Archicad is sold in. As you can imagine, over the years, this localized content has developed in its own directions, resulting in a wealth of good GDL - that is sadly unavailable to the rest of the world. Much of Europe wants to know what is in the USA library, and much of North America wants to know what is in the INT library. Soon, you will be able to download a single library, and discover everything (almost - weÃƒÅ½???ll explain) you have been missing out on!\n\nFor more information - or to make a donation to the ACE projects - please visit: http://www.archicad.ca/?p=75","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cfdac675077f69a166a389f64807ced39b6838a","amp;dn":"ArchiCad-ACE-Library-V1PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cfdac675077f69a166a389f64807ced39b6838a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,253,172,103,80,119,246,154,22,106,56,159,100,128,124,237,57,182,131,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
