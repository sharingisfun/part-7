Farther into the black unknown of space. There is no other path, no way for the lost to go, save forward. Admiral Terrance Comptonâ€™s fleet is cut off from Earth, deep in the heart of the enemy First Imperium. A third of his people have died in the year his force had been fleeing from its enemies, but he is as determined as ever to find a new home for his people, a way to save his wartorn fleet\r\n\r\nHis people are running low on everythingâ€”food, ammunition, fuel, and the brutal enemy is in relentless pursuit, marshaling all its vast resources to track down and destroy the human refugees. Compton must find a way to replenish his dwindling stores, while avoiding the massive enemy forces hunting his fleet from system to system.\r\n\r\nCompton seeks an escape, a refuge for his exhausted spacers from the relentless pursuit of their enemies. But they are about to find far more than that, as they discover the truth of the distant past, and a glimpse of a new future that lies before them. What they learn will shake all they believeâ€¦and force them to reconsider who they are. And what victory would look like.\r\n\r\nThe fight has just begunâ€¦and the stakes are even higher than any of them had imagined. \r\n\r\nRead by Jay Snyder\r\nFormat: MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e48edea082ee4fab3efd6de9eb66de304366f339","amp;dn":"Jay+Allan+-+Shadows+of+the+Gods+%28Crimson+Worlds+Refugees+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e48edea082ee4fab3efd6de9eb66de304366f339","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,142,222,160,130,238,79,171,62,253,109,233,235,102,222,48,67,102,243,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
