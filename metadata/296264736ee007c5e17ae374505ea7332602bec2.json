Set in the New York City borough of The Bronx, the show starred Ted Danson as the title character, Dr. John Becker, a doctor who operates a small practice and is constantly annoyed by his patients, co-workers, friends, and practically everything and everybody else in his world. As a result of his outspoken nature, Becker is inaccessible to most people that do not know him. His patients and friends are nonetheless loyal, because Becker portrays a kind-hearted side that shows that, despite his cantankerous personality, he really does care about them.\n\nOn April 28, 2008, CBS Home Entertainment released the First season of Becker on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time. The Second season will be released on February 3, 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:296264736ee007c5e17ae374505ea7332602bec2","amp;dn":"Becker.S01.DVDRip.XviD-SAiNTS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"296264736ee007c5e17ae374505ea7332602bec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,98,100,115,110,224,7,197,225,122,227,116,80,94,167,51,38,2,190,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
