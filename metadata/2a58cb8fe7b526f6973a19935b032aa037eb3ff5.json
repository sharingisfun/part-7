Mariana wants to get out of hell. She reaches out her hand to a half dead man, LeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o. It&amp;#039;s only natural, Mariana is full of life and thinks that maybe the two of them can escape from hell together.\n\nOn the way, she believes that she is bringing the dead man to the world of the living.\n\nSeven days and nights later, she realises she was wrong. She brought a living man among the dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n******************************** FREAKYFLICKS *********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
