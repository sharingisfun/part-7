[2002] [only1joe] MP3-320kbps\n\nUp! is the fourth studio album released in 2002 by Canadian singer Shania Twain. Three versions of the album were released: a pop version (red disc), a country version (green disc), and an international version (blue disc) in the style of Indian film music; all three discs contain exactly the same track listing and feature distinctly identifiable picture labels (for example, Twain sports a cowboy hat on the green country disc.) In the U.S., Up! debuted at #1 with sales of 874,000 copies. On September 23, 2004, the RIAA certified Up! at 11Ãƒâ€” Platinum,[1] giving her the distinction of being the only female artist to have three consecutive Diamond albums released in the United States.\n\nRed CD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Up\n[02] I'm Gonna Getcha Good\n[03] She's Not Just A Pretty Face\n[04] Juanita\n[05] Forever And For Always\n[06] Ain't No Paticular Way\n[07] It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing\n[08] Nah\n[09] (Wanna Get To Know You) That Good\n[10] C'est La Vie\n[11] I'm Jealous\n[12] Ka-Ching\n[13] Thank You Baby!
