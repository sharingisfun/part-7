Six countries. One journey. Innersection Films continues its pioneering adventures in collaborative filmmaking with the release of SE7EN SIGNS. For this project, an online audience picked their favorite six filmmakers from the Innersection series and we sent them each in a different direction to film their part of this surf/travel movie. But instead of making six short films, director Nathan Myers (Here &amp; Now, Castles in the Sky) creatively curated each of the filmmakersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ edits into a single, rollicking, surprise-filled adventure. This is a film about traveling in search of wavesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and everything that happens along the way.\n\nSurfers:\nPeter DeVries\nAsher Pacey\nOzzy Wright\nTorrey Meister\nJoel Fitzgerald\nHarrison Roach\nOtis Carey\nDaniel Jones\nChris Del Moro\nEli Steele\nNoah Cohen\nGavin Gillette\nKiron Jabour\n\nFile size                                : 1.34 GiB\nDuration                                : 46m 29s\nOverall bit rate                        : 4142 Kbps\n\nWidth                                    : 960 pixels\nHeight                                  : 718 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                    : 16:9\nFrame rate                              : 29.970 fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51c278053f46f1cf79b337dd181967bde553b620","amp;dn":"Se7en+Signs+-+A+Traveling+Film+-+2013.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51c278053f46f1cf79b337dd181967bde553b620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,194,120,5,63,70,241,207,121,179,55,221,24,25,103,189,229,83,182,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
