Waugh and Martin H. Greenberg\nJaico | 1991 | ISBN:N/A | PDF | 504 pages | 17.2 mb\nscanned to PDF by me.\n\nThe 1930s was the decade in which science fiction found its voice. Toward the end of that decade, the voice began to resemble, more and more, tjhat of John Wood Campbell, Jr., and in the 1940s, J.W.C. dominated the field to the point where to many he seemed all of science fiction. He had a charismatic personality that utterly dominated everyone he met. He overflowed with energy and he had his way with science fiction. He found it pulp and he turned into something that was his heart's desire. He then made it the heart's desire of the reader.Campbell put science fiction center stage and made it a field that could be written successfully only by science fiction writers who had learned their craft.\nIt was a phenomenon that had never happened before and can never be repeated.It is a true measure of the dominance of Campbell in the 1940s, that, of the ten stories in this collection, eight are from Astounding. The other two, by van Vogt (who is certainly a Campbell author just the same) and Fredric Brown, are from Thrilling Wonder Stories.\nIt is only fair to remember that not all great science fiction writers could write for Campbell. Some simply did not have, or did not want, the Campbell touch, and went their own way. Fredric Brown was one of these. AnotherÃ¢â‚¬â€and perhaps the greatest of all science fiction writers who couldn't or wouldn't be a Campbell authorÃ¢â‚¬â€was Ray Bradbury.\nIn this collections of stories you will find yourself once again in the Golden Age of science fiction and the great days of John W. Campbell, Jr.\n\nCONTENTS\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ix\nINTRODUCTION by Isaac Asimov 1\nTIME WANTS A SKELETON by Ross Rocklynne 7\nTHE WEAPONS SHOP by A.E. van Vogt 60\nNERVES by Lester del Rey 97\nDAYMARE by Fredric Brown 167\nKILLDOZER! by Theodore Sturgeon 205\nNO WOMAN BORN by C.L.Moore 269\nTHE BIG AND THE LITTLE by Isaac Asimov 313\nGIANT KILLER by A.
