Filmed in Technicolor, the picture starred Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains, Patric Knowles, Eugene Pallette, and Alan Hale.\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood was produced at an estimated cost of $2 million, and was the first Warner Bros. film to be shot in the three-strip Technicolor process (one of the few major motion pictures of the 1930s to do this). It was an unusually extravagant production for the Warner Bros. studio, which had made a name for itself in producing gritty, low-budget gangster films, but their adventure movies starring Flynn had generated hefty revenue and Robin Hood was created to capitalize on this.\n\nIn 1995, this film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry.\n\nIMDB: 8.2/10\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0029843/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0029843/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1880f3185f36aef6860dd1b3f636523001d15cae","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Robin+Hood+%281938%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1880f3185f36aef6860dd1b3f636523001d15cae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,128,243,24,95,54,174,246,134,13,209,179,246,54,82,48,1,209,92,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
