Only Remembered\n\nDiversions III, Songs From The Shipyards is the third album in a very productive year for The Unthanks. The series started, fortuitously for us, as &quot;A silly idea that wouldn't go away&quot; for Adrian McNally. The first album was a magnificent live celebration of the songs of Antony Heggerty and Robert Wyatt and the second was a brilliantly conceived collaboration with The Brighouse And Rastrick Brass Band. This latest album sees the band perform songs taken from a Tyneside Cinema commissioned film charting the history of shipbuilding. Originally performed live, by the band, as a stunning soundtrack to accompany the visual imagery it is both stirring, striking and scintillating.\n\nSongs From The Shipyards, the album, has been altered a little from the live performance but is certainly no less effective. The songs may not be in the same order and you don't have the iconic celluloid sequences to enhance the powerful narrative but these songs are all good enough to stand solo scrutiny when removed from their inspiration.\n\nWhat makes this, and their other albums, so strong is the consistency of the performance and the overall attention to detail. The songs are all so well chosen, arranged, interpreted and performed that you are left aghast at the sheer beauty of each composition. Rachel and Becky Unthank's voices are once again shown to be instruments of such delicious and descriptive evocation that you can't fail to be beguiled by them. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df969522cfc09cff1eb86205db81c2b06325ae67","amp;dn":"The+Unthanks+-+Diversions+Vol.+3%3A+Songs+from+the+Shipyards+%5B2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df969522cfc09cff1eb86205db81c2b06325ae67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,150,149,34,207,192,156,255,30,184,98,5,219,129,194,176,99,37,174,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
