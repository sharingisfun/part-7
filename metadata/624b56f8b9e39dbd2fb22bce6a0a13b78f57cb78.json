While the first Burnout was inspired by European movies and locations, its sequel is inspired by American films such as The Fast and the Furious. Set in US locations, the game gives you an all-new set of vehicles: modified Japanese cars, pickups, SUVs - plus some bonus rides such as police cruisers, and classic 50's hotrods. Also, expect tighter handling, better crash deformations, new music, new game structure, enhanced physics, new lighting, improved car models, a new replay system, and fast-paced fun.\n\nBurnout 3 challenges you to crash into (and through) busy intersections, while creating as much damage as possible. You can battle your way to the front of the pack by taking down rivals and causing spectacular crashes. For those who thirst for crashes, the game includes a crash mode that rewards you for creating massive pileups. With multiplayer gameplay, more than 100 events, and 40 tracks, Burnout 3 provides intense speed and action.\n\nBurnout Revenge is a racing game in which your desire for destruction is as important as your ability to reach the finish line. The sequel to Burnout 3 adds some new features such as detailed car damage, crash combos, and a meter that rewards vengeance on the road. Game modes run the range from pure racing to pure destruction on a handful of real-world locations, including Detroit and Rome. Burnout revenge also supports online play for challenging other players.\n\nPushing the limits of the PSP and the PlayStation 2, Burnout Dominator features the most explosive visuals seen on the platforms, engaging multiplayer modes to suit, and a PSP exclusive feature that allows you to synchronize your game with your friends and thrash their high scores and race times.\n\n[INSTALL]\nTo unpack , use the 7 -Zip or WinRAR\nBurn with Nero or UltraISO.\nBurn to disc DVD-5 or 4x Speed\nEnjoy!
