Physical principles determine the stability of proteins and nucleic acids, the rate at which biochemical reactions proceed, the transport of molecules across biological molecules; they allow us to describe structure and reactivity in complex biological systems, and make sense of how these systems operate. Physical Chemistry for the Life Sciences fills a void in the textbook market by offering a balanced presentation of the concepts of physical chemistry, and their extensive applications to biology and biochemistry.\n\n- A Biochemical link at the start of each section explains how the physical chemistry content of the section is related to a biological concept, providing clear connections to students and acting as motivators for understanding\n- Toolbox sections describe techniques, and link experimental method with physical chemistry concepts, so the student can understand how experimental techniques are used to probe and solve chemical questions\n- Maths comments explain mathematical relationships and background necessary for solving problems, providing guidance and insight to bolster student understanding\n- Derivations present detailed derivations of key equations, and delineate intermediate steps, showing the student the enormous power of even simple mathematics\n- Worked examples illustrate the concepts being presented, empowering the student to apply the concepts for themselves\n- Self tests occur throughout the chapters, to enable students to immediately test their understanding\n- Checklists of key ideas at the end of each chapter provide a bulleted list of the information students should grasp from the chapter, facilitating student revision\n- End of chapter exercises come in three varieties, to enable students to apply the concepts introduced and check their understanding: - Discussion questions stimulate the qualitative understanding of problems\n- Exercises assess quantitative understanding - Projects stimulate more in-depth examination of questions at both a qualitative and quantitative level Online Resource Centre\n- Web links for each chapter, pointing students to interesting sources of related information and data, to facilitate self-directed learning\n- A list of key equations for each chapter, to help students revise and master the key mathematical concepts that underpin the subject\n- Living graphs, which present graphs from the text in interactive format, and enable students to strengthen their learning\n- Full colour artwork from the text in downloadable form, to facilitate lecture preparation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd19c1bbda4f6e86657f942f046de233db336309","amp;dn":"Physical+Chemistry+for+the+Life+Sciences+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd19c1bbda4f6e86657f942f046de233db336309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,25,193,187,218,79,110,134,101,127,148,47,4,109,226,51,219,51,99,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
