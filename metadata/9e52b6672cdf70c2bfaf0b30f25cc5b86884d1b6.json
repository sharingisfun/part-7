By day temperatures soared on the sweltering streets of Manhattan but by night a serial killer dubbed the Son of Sam stalked the suburbs, indiscriminately shooting young brunettes and held New York City in a grip of terror.\n\nTrying to make sense of their lives in this overwhelming atmosphere of fear and suspicion are Vinny, a streetwise Casanova indulging in affairs under the nose of his loving wife, Dionna, and Ritchie, a punk musician moonlighting as a male stripper.\n\nAs the murder's actions impact on all their lifestyles, they start to suspect the killer might be someone from their own neighborhood - or even one of their own friends.\n\nFrom the controversial director Spike Lee comes his boldest and most ambitious film brilliantly capturing the sights, sounds and sexual attitudes of the 1970s.\n\nRelease Info:\n\n[FORMAT]:.......................[ Matroska (MKV)\n[GENRE]:........................[ Crime | Drama | Romance \n[NO OF CDs].....................[ 1\n[FILE SIZE]:....................[ 703 MB\n[RESOLUTION]:...................[ 608 x 320\n[ASPECT RATIO]:.................[ 1.900\n[FRAME RATE]:...................[ 25.000 fps\n[VIDEO BITRATE]:................[ x264 667 kbps\n[AUDIO BITRATE]:................[ AAC 64 kbps\n[LANGUAGE ]:....................[ English\n[SUBTITLES]:....................[ English\n[RELEASE RUNTIME]:..............[ 02:16:02 (End Credits Intact) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e52b6672cdf70c2bfaf0b30f25cc5b86884d1b6","amp;dn":"Summer+Of+Sam+%281999%29+DVDrip+x264+by+BaDTaStE+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e52b6672cdf70c2bfaf0b30f25cc5b86884d1b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,82,182,103,44,223,112,194,191,175,11,48,242,92,197,184,104,132,209,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
