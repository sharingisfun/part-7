Anderson and published between 2002 and 2008. The books are set in a not-too-distant future where humans have colonized a number of other planets across the galaxy, thanks in part to technological assistance from an ancient alien race, the Ildirans. The series chronicles the universe-spanning war that erupts when humans inadvertently ignite the fury of a hidden empire of elemental aliens known as the hydrogues. Internal conflict is sparked within both the human and Ildiran empires as other ancient elemental races reappear to renew their own ancient war with the hydrogues.\n\n\n01 - Hidden Empire\n02 - A Forest of Stars\n03 - Horizon Storms\n04 - Scattered Suns\n05 - Of Fire And Night\n06 - Metal Swarm\n07 - The Ashes of Worlds\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c24d5f6034d2784f678fc5b4cdebf452226b3f8f","amp;dn":"Kevin+J+Anderson+-+Saga+of+Seven+Suns+Books+1+-+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c24d5f6034d2784f678fc5b4cdebf452226b3f8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,77,95,96,52,210,120,79,103,143,197,180,205,235,244,82,34,107,63,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
