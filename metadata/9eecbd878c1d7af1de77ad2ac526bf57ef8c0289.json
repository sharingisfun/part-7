Over time she forgot what it was like to live a normal life, but she never let go of her hope to escape the compound where she has been held for the past nine years.\n\nVictor is a cold-blooded assassin who, like Sarai, has known only death and violence since he was a young boy. When Victor arrives at the compound to collect details and payment for a hit, Sarai sees him as her only opportunity for escape. But things donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go as planned and instead of finding transport back to Tucson, she finds herself free from one dangerous man and caught in the clutches of another.\n\nWhile on the run, Victor strays from his primal nature as he succumbs to his conscience and resolves to help Sarai. As they grow closer, he finds himself willing to risk everything to keep her alive; even his relationship with his devoted brother and liaison, Niklas, who now like everyone else wants Sarai dead.\n\nAs Victor and Sarai slowly build a trust, the differences between them seem to lessen, and an unlikely attraction intensifies. But VictorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brutal skills and experience may not be enough in the end to save her, as the power she unknowingly holds over him may ultimately be what gets her killed.\n\nThis is their storyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9eecbd878c1d7af1de77ad2ac526bf57ef8c0289","amp;dn":"Killing+Sarai+%28Killing+Sarai+%231%29+by+J.A.+Redmerski+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9eecbd878c1d7af1de77ad2ac526bf57ef8c0289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,236,189,135,140,29,122,241,222,119,173,42,197,38,191,87,239,140,2,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
