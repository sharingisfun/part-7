Our 'survivor' is someone who takes life for granted, and has yet to truly value what he has. The adventure that awaits him is meticulously crafted to give him the ultimate wake-up call, and teach him valuable life-lessons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11bdac75d28a9b7f701b09ceb6abb03c3b288575","amp;dn":"Derren+Brown%3A+Apocalypse+%282012%29+720p+%28Part+I+%26amp%3B+II%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11bdac75d28a9b7f701b09ceb6abb03c3b288575","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,189,172,117,210,138,155,127,112,27,9,206,182,171,176,60,59,40,133,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
