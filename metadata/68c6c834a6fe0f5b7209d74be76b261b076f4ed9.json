Each of the 100 traces is accompanied by a list of the main diagnostic features along with a full report of the ECG, noting any other clinical details that may be important. Boxes list the common causes of the abnormalities shown. Key features of the ECG are reproduced again using annotations to guide the reader.

This collection of traces, updated for this Third Edition with new cases, will be invaluable to all involved in the diagnosis of the most commonly encountered ECG abnormalities.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Provides full size and realistic reproduction of 12-lead ECGs\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Includes a wide range of cardiac abnormalities\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Highlights the diagnostic criteria for each abnormality listed\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Reflects how this subject is encountered in practice\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Assists the reader by illustrating alongside the key features of the recording; thus these can be viewed in relation to the whole trace\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The Third Edition is spiral bound to make it easier for a reader to lay the ECG traces flat for study.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Several new cases are included plus a new section on the approach to the ECG has been added.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68c6c834a6fe0f5b7209d74be76b261b076f4ed9","amp;dn":"ECGs+by+Example%2C+3E+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68c6c834a6fe0f5b7209d74be76b261b076f4ed9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,198,200,52,166,254,15,91,114,9,215,75,231,107,38,27,7,111,78,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
