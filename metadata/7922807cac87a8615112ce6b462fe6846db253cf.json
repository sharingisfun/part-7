Spy Protector + Crack\n \n\n\nRelease date: June 04, 2009 (actual version at June 06, 2010)\n\n\nNOTE:\n*****\n\nAll tested serials and cracks for the previous Security Task Manager v1.7x don't \nunlock all features of Security Task Manager. This crack for Security Task Manager \nv1.7h unlocks all features, meaning:\n\n1- Spy Protector can be enabled.\n2- Security Task Manager shows all running processes, services, drivers, etc.\n3- The Help &gt; Info of STM shows: Registered full version (no buy-option anymore!).\n\nIf not, then the installed Security Task Manager version isn't fully unlocked!!!\n\n\n\nDescription Security Task Manager:\n**********************************\n\nSecurity Task Manager shows comprehensible information about programs &amp; processes \nrunning on the computer (applications, DLLs, BHOs, and services).  \n\nSecurity Task Manager detects unknown malware and rootkits hidden from your\nantivirus software. The security risk rating indicates the likelihood of the \nprocess being potential spyware, malware, a Trojan, or keylogger.\n\nSecurity Task Manager also deletes traces of your Internet and computer activity, \nprevents keyboard input monitoring, and warns you when the registry is changed. \nThis process viewer also recognizes stealth processes and virtual driver software \nhidden from the Windows Task Manager.\n\nSecurity Task Manager tells you exactly what programs are running on your computer \n- and it gives you answers to the obvious ensuing questions, such as where these \nprograms reside, who makes them, what they are called, whether they include hidden \ncomponents, and what all this means to your computer.\n\nSecurity Task Manager shows all active processes on your computer. You can easily \nrecognize the endangering potential of each process. No other Task Manager or \nProcess Viewer has this feature. Furthermore you can put a process into quarantine \nor search the internet for information about that process.\n\nSecurity Task Manager improves on Windows Task Manager for each process, it's \nproviding a security risk rating, a process description, file path, CPU usage \ngraph, start time, embedded hidden functions (for example keyboard monitoring, \nautostart entry, and browser supervision or manipulation), and process type, \nsuch as visible window, systray program, DLL, and IE plug-in. \n\n\n\nSome features of Security Task Manager:\n***************************************\n\n- Unique security risk rating - The security risk rating indicates the likelihood \n  of a process being potential spyware, malware or a Trojan. The rating is purely \n  based on behaviour and code analysis, and does not use any signature files. \n- Comments from our experts and user community.\n- Free online scan with all known Antivirus engines.\n- Full directory path and file name. \n- Process description. \n- CPU usage graph. \n- Embedded hidden functions (e.g. keyboard monitoring, browser supervision or \n  manipulation). \n- Process type (e.g. visible window, systray program, DLL, IE-plugin, startup \n  service). \n \n\n\nSpyProtector\n************\n\nSecurity Task Manager also contains SpyProtector for protecting your computer and \nInternet privacy. SpyProtector deletes history, disables keyboard monitoring and \nwarns you when registry is changed. You can easily monitor your autostart/startup \nregistry entries.\n\n- Prevents keyboard and mouse monitoring \n  (That stops keylogger or other hacker tools)\n\n- Warns when registry is changed \n  (That protects you from Trojans that surreptitiously add an autostart key)\n\n- Eliminates the traces of your internet activity \n  (e.g. cookies, cache, history, typed URLs and temporary files)\n\n- Eliminates the traces of your work on computer \n  (e.g. recent used file list of programs; Word, ACDSee, PDF, WinZip, Media player)\n\n\n\nWhat's new in Security Task Manager v1.7h:\n******************************************\n\n- Version 1.7h detects network worms like the conficker worm. \n\n\n\nSystem requirements:\n********************\n\n- Windows Vista, XP, 2000, 2003, 2008\n  On Windows Vista, program's help file needs Microsoft WinHlp32 \n- 2 MB free disk space \n\n\n\nMore info:\n**********\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.neuber.com/taskmanager/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.neuber.com/taskmanager/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When using TPB please read these important notes: \n****************************************************\n\n01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my TPB account:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis torrent is scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security \n2- Avira AntiVir Premium \n3- avast! Pro Antivirus\n4- Kaspersky Antivirus\n\nAlso scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by \nother anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at June 08, 2010 - 20.15 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7922807cac87a8615112ce6b462fe6846db253cf","amp;dn":"Security+Task+Manager+v1.7h+incl.+Spy+Protector+%2B+Crack+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7922807cac87a8615112ce6b462fe6846db253cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,34,128,124,172,135,168,97,81,18,206,107,70,47,230,132,109,178,83,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
