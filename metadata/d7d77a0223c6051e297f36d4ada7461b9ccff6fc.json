Working at different firms, they come to this realization separately; but after they discover one another, the flash boys band together and set out to reform the financial markets. This they do by creating an exchange in which high-frequency tradingÃ¢â‚¬â€source of the most intractable problemsÃ¢â‚¬â€will have no advantage whatsoever.\n \nThe characters in Flash Boys are fabulous, each completely different from what you think of when you think Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wall Street guy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Several have walked away from jobs in the financial sector that paid them millions of dollars a year. From their new vantage point they investigate the big banks, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stock exchanges, and high-frequency trading firms as they have never been investigated, and expose the many strange new ways that Wall Street generates profits.\n \nThe light that Lewis shines into the darkest corners of the financial world may not be good for your blood pressure, because if you have any contact with the market, even a retirement account, this story is happening to you. But in the end, Flash Boys is an uplifting read. Here are people who have somehow preserved a moral sense in an environment where you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get paid for that; they have perceived an institutionalized injustice and are willing to go to war to fix it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7d77a0223c6051e297f36d4ada7461b9ccff6fc","amp;dn":"Flash+Boys+-+Michael+Lewis+-+EPUB+-+Mr+Festus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7d77a0223c6051e297f36d4ada7461b9ccff6fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,215,122,2,35,198,5,30,41,127,54,212,173,167,70,27,156,207,246,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
