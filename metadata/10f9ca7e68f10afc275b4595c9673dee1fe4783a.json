WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more, Mystic Initiation offers desert rock breaks and atypical solos between bouts of Pink Floyd flashbacks.&quot;\nstonerrock.com (USA)\n\n&quot;The thing IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m most fond of, about this debut album, is the successful infusion of psychedelic post-rock sounds into heavy stoner rock.&quot;\nwordsorcery.org (Romania)\n\n&quot;Blues and 70's psychedelic rock are flowing like fresh blood through their instrumental heavy rock, and I'm surprised about the good quality of their blend. This is a very good start from a new band, which deserves more attention.&quot;\nCosmic Lava (Germany)\n\n&quot;What they play is beyond description. Seriously guitar heavy, stoner grooved post metal. My best advice is to pop over to their myspace page and see what the best of the Romanian rock scene has to offer. This one you won't regret.&quot;\nThe Ripple Effect (USA)\n\n&quot;This power trio really can play, and they can add a lot of emotion to their playing in a great way as well.&quot;\nPsychotropic Zone (Finland)\n&quot;This band has promise for sure. I look forward to hearing their next material.&quot;\nLowcut (Denmark)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10f9ca7e68f10afc275b4595c9673dee1fe4783a","amp;dn":"The+%3AEgocentrics+-+Love+Fear+Choices+And+Astronauts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10f9ca7e68f10afc275b4595c9673dee1fe4783a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,249,202,126,104,241,10,252,39,91,69,149,201,103,61,238,31,228,120,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
