Recorded at Derby College on the Fighting tour, the gig was captured for a radio broadcast.\n\nThis really is the next best thing to having been there, as the band tear through a set consisting of many of the harder tracks which had begun to replace the more romantic sound of Nightlife. Some of the material here was so new it hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been recorded yet, such as the unfamiliar versions ofCowboy Song (Derby Blues) and Me &amp; The Boys.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a snapshot of a band on their way up, not quite yet possessing the hard-boiled confidence they would later display, and way before things started to go awry for Lynott and his various addictions. What you will also find here is some of the best Lynott crowd banter, and a band trying out some new songs and part-songs that will later evolve into chart smashes.\n \nThis will never replace Live &amp; Dangerous as the definitive Thin Lizzy document  but for fans itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an essential portrait of the band as they approached their prime.\nThis set reveals Thin Lizzy as one of the greatest live bands in history.  \nFascinating.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:594a32955f30c3cb070d2cb9f37309d1eb10fce7","amp;dn":"Thin+Lizzy+-+UK+Tour+75+%2F+Live+in+Derby+1975","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"594a32955f30c3cb070d2cb9f37309d1eb10fce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,74,50,149,95,48,195,203,7,13,44,185,243,115,9,209,235,16,252,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
