Contains some of his best compositions, including &quot;Early Mornin' Rain,&quot; &quot;I'm Not Sayin',&quot; &quot;The Way I Feel,&quot; &quot;Lovin' Me,&quot; and &quot;Ribbon of Darkness.&quot; At this point, Lightfoot was still including some covers in his repertoire, and he handles numbers by Phil Ochs (&quot;Changes&quot;), Ewan McColl (&quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;), and Hamilton Camp (&quot;Pride of Man&quot;) well. The whole album is included on The United Artists Collection.\n\nTrack title\n1. Rich Man's Spiritual\n2. Long River\n3. The Way I Feel\n4. For Lovin' Me\n5. The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\n6.
