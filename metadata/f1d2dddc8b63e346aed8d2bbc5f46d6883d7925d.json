YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve barely covered 100 yards when you hear them. They must be close. You can hear every guttural breath, every rattling groan - theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re everywhere. Zombies. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one thing you can do: Run!\n\nZombies, Run! is an ultra-immersive running game and audio adventure, co-created with award-winning novelist Naomi Alderman. We deliver the story straight to your headphones through orders and voice recordings - and when you get back home, you use the supplies youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve collected while running to build and grow your base.\n\nWALK, JOG, OR RUN ANYWHERE \nZombies, Run! works anywhere and at any speed. You can jog in a park, run along a beach, or walk along a trail.\n\nYOU ARE RUNNER 5 \nHundreds of lives are counting on you. You've got to rebuild your base from a few shivering survivors into a fortified beacon of civilization by collecting critical supplies and avoiding roving zombie hordes. Can you save them and learn the truth about the zombie apocalypse?\n\nA WORLD OF STORIES\nYou become the hero in an epic story of humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s struggle for survival where your running *really* matters - and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a deeper mystery to be uncovered as well... This app includes all 33 missions from Season 1 as well as the first 7 missions from Season 2; and there'll be a further 60+ Season 2 missions released weekly and available for purchase!\n\nYOUR OWN MIX \nChoose your own custom playlists before you start running: the story unfolds in between your tracks through a series of dynamic radio messages and voice recordings.\n\nINTERVAL TRAINING - WITH ZOMBIES \nWith our optional Ã¢â‚¬ËœZombie ChasesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mode, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to increase your speed and work up a sweat if you hear zombies on your tail. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right - weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made interval training *fun*!\n\nVIEW YOUR RUNS ONLINE WITH ZOMBIELINK\nRegister with our free ZombieLink service to view and share your runs online, complete with maps and full run history. Plus you can sync your runs with Runkeeper, export them as GPX files, and share them with friends!\n\nKEEP THE SURVIVORS ALIVE \nYou automatically collect items like medicine, batteries, and ammo while running - but when you're back home, who needs them more: the soldiers or the doctors? Which buildings need extra defenses? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to you.\n\nNOTES\n- Version 2.0 comes with 30 missions\n- Requires Android 4.0 or above\n- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n* ALL-NEW AIRDROP MODE! Abel needs you to recover supply drops sent from Mullins Military Base. Select a point on a real-world map that you want to run to, and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll build a dynamic mission to cover that distance and your journey back, with distance updates as you run!\n* Fixed crash on startup for some devices on 2.4.0\n* Minor bug fixes and enhancements.\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sixtostart.zombiesrun&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sixtostart.zombiesrun&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1d2dddc8b63e346aed8d2bbc5f46d6883d7925d","amp;dn":"Zombies%2C+Run%21+2+v2.4.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1d2dddc8b63e346aed8d2bbc5f46d6883d7925d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,210,221,220,139,99,227,70,174,216,210,187,197,244,109,104,131,215,146,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
