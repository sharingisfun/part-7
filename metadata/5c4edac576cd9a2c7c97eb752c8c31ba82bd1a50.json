It covers the key topics of water resources engineering, from the estimation of runoff volumes and unit hydrographs to the routing of flows along a river and through lakes, reservoirs, and hydraulic structures. It deals with questions regarding basic hydrological data, hydrological modeling and the prediction and forecasting of low flows and flood discharges","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c4edac576cd9a2c7c97eb752c8c31ba82bd1a50","amp;dn":"Hydrology%3A+A+Science+for+Engineers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c4edac576cd9a2c7c97eb752c8c31ba82bd1a50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,78,218,197,118,205,154,44,124,151,235,117,44,140,49,186,130,189,26,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
