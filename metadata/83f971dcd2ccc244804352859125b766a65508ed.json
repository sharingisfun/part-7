Winstone initially seems to play the King as little more than a London gangster, but he gradually unfolds a complex, brutal, manipulative, romantic, dedicated and driven man with great skill.\n\nIn a role which harks back to Lady Jane (1986), Helena Bonham Carter makes an intelligent and sardonic Anne Boleyn, her bold performance contrasting strongly with GeneviÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ve Bujold in Anne of the Thousand Days (1969). Emily Blunt impresses as the sexpot Katherine Howard, and Emilia Fox is compelling as Henry's greatest love, Jane Seymour. \n\nThere's fine support from an all-star cast, including Sean Bean, Charles Dance and David Suchet. The production is unflinching, with burnings, torture, marital violence and executions graphically portrayed. If there's a weakness it lies in too-modern dialogue and an uncertain visual style, with noticeable borrowings from John Boorman's Excalibur and Ridley Scott's Gladiator, as well as setting Shakespeare in Love-style elegance against the ugly colours and graininess of reality TV. \n\nUltimately Henry VIII plays most like a prequel to Elizabeth (1999) - right down to using the same piece of Elgar to underscore the finale - and has most of the same faults and virtues as that Oscar-winning film.\n\nThis film and many others can be found on the film/music torrent site: files24.com.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83f971dcd2ccc244804352859125b766a65508ed","amp;dn":"Henry+VIII++%282003+-+Ray+Winstone%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83f971dcd2ccc244804352859125b766a65508ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,249,113,220,210,204,194,68,128,67,82,133,145,37,183,102,166,85,8,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
