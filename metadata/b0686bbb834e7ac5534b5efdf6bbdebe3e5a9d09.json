Using a wealth of previously unpublished material and numerous first-hand interviews, Huffington documents Callas' interminable conflict with her mother, her deeply emotional relationship with her voice, the gradual unravelling of her first marriage, her passionate love affair with of Aristotle Onassis, her agony and humiliation at his leaving her, and her secret abortion.\n\n\nProduct Details:\n\nFile size: epub 2.05 MB,  mobi 2.27 MB\nPublisher: Cooper Square Press\nISBN-13: 9781461624295\nLanguage: English\n\n\nNote: Have tested out all the chapter headings of both file types, using Calibre for PC for the epub, and Kindle for PC for the mobi file.\n\n\nEnjoy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0686bbb834e7ac5534b5efdf6bbdebe3e5a9d09","amp;dn":"Maria+Callas+by+Arianna+Huffington+epub+mobi+Non-fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0686bbb834e7ac5534b5efdf6bbdebe3e5a9d09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,104,107,187,131,78,122,197,83,75,94,253,246,187,222,190,62,90,157,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
