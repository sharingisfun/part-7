The Favourite Day Songfacts reports that they were formed by Jack Steadman (vocals, guitar, bass), Jamie MacColl (bass, guitar, banjo, vocals), Suren De Saram (drums) under the name of The Canals when they were 15. Ed Nash (bass, keyboard, mandolin) later joined the trio as they switched between various aliases before picking Bombay Bicycle Club. The band took their name from a chain of curry houses in the London Area, and have since admitted that they dislike their band name. The band has released three albums, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Had the Blues But I Shook Them LooseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2009), Ã¢â‚¬Å“FlawsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2010) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Different Kind Of FixÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2011).\n\nThey are otherwise known as the band that opened V Festival 2006 (having won the Ã¢â‚¬ËœRoad to VÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ competition) &amp; have also played Reading / Leeds Festival for the past three years, running.\n\nIn Febuary 2007 they released their dÃƒÂ©but EP The Boy I Used to Be, and this was followed up in October with the release of their second EP How We Are. In mid-July of 2009 they released their first album I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose consisting of 12 tracks. They are currently partaking in their biggest tour yet, including a sell-out date at LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Heaven venue.\n\nIn Summer 2010 they released their new album, Flaws. A UK tour co-incided with the release of the album which - surprisingly - is an acoustic recording. Venues on the tour reflected this new acoustic orientation. St GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in Bristol, for example, is normally used by classical and folk artists.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yvjI3Ss.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yvjI3Ss.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:310237b79201b0fa0a33272b4606b5b574dbf245","amp;dn":"Bombay+Bicycle+Club+Album+Discography+%5B2011-2009%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"310237b79201b0fa0a33272b4606b5b574dbf245","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,2,55,183,146,1,176,250,10,51,39,43,70,6,181,181,116,219,242,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
