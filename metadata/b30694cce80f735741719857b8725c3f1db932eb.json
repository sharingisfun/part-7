Each episode tackles a different mystery; from the secret missions of the Second World War, to the truth about the Nazi gold hidden in the Alps, to revealing insights about Hitler himself - was he bipolar? Did he use cocaine? Was his personal physician trying to poison him?\n\n\n1)  Nazi Gold \nDocumentary investigating mysteries of the Third Reich and casting light on Adolf Hitler's secret life. It begins by looking at the lost treasure allegedly buried in Lake Toplitz after panicked Nazis shipped crates of gold, diamonds and stolen art there while the Allies closed in on Berlin. However, many explorers have searched in vain and the loot has become subject of several conspiracy theories.\n\n2)  Deadly Missions of World War 2 \nExploring the most secret and mystifying operations of the Second World War including the 1943 Gran Sasso mission to free Benito Mussolini.\n\n3)  Hitlers Drug Use Revealed \nIt's hardly surprising that the frantic, paranoid, sweaty leader of the Third Reich might have taken cocaine. And yet, the extent of his supposed habit would shock even the most hardened storm trooper. The dictator's medical records suggest a hopeless addict. Many were written by the Fuhrer's very own Dr Feelgood: his personal physician, Theodor Morell. The doctor accompanied him everywhere, prescribing a dangerous cocktail of drugs. As you would expect from a coked-up Hitler, this is lurid stuff that overreaches itself. That said, it exposes yet another dark side to the dictator. High Hitler, indeed.\n\n4)  The Ghost of U 513 \nWhat really happened to the German U-513 submarine when it sunk in 1943? We uncover the mysteries surrounding its final resting place. The story of how adventurer Vilfredo Schurmann travelled to the Brazilian coast and located the wreck of Nazi submarine U-513.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0c44656b644c403f223c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 2152 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 960 x 540\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 692 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://natgeotv.com/uk/nazi-underworld&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://natgeotv.com/uk/nazi-underworld&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b30694cce80f735741719857b8725c3f1db932eb","amp;dn":"Nazi+Underworld+Series+1+4of4+The+Ghost+Of+U+513+540p+PDTV+x264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b30694cce80f735741719857b8725c3f1db932eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,6,148,204,232,15,115,87,65,113,152,87,184,114,92,63,29,185,50,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
