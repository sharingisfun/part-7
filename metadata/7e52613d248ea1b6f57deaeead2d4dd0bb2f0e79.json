In Berkeley, California, in its hippie heyday, he found methamphetamine and LSD and heroin. He sniffed nitrous oxide in Malaysia and frequented CalcuttaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opium dens. Ultimately, though, his journey took him where it takes most addicts: into a life of addiction, desperation, deception, and crime.\nBut unlike most addicts, Lewis recovered and became a developmental psychologist and researcher in neuroscience. In Memoirs of an Addicted Brain, he applies his professional expertise to a study of his former self, using the story of his own journey through addiction to tell the universal story of addictions of every kind. He explains the neurological effects of a variety of powerful drugs, and shows how they speak to the brainÃ¢â‚¬â€itself designed to seek rewards and soothe painÃ¢â‚¬â€in its own language. And he illuminates how craving overtakes the nervous system, sculpting a synaptic network dedicated to one goalÃ¢â‚¬â€moreÃ¢â‚¬â€at the expense of everything else.\nGenre: General","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e52613d248ea1b6f57deaeead2d4dd0bb2f0e79","amp;dn":"Memoirs+of+an+Addicted+Brain+A+Neuroscientist+Examines+his+Forme","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e52613d248ea1b6f57deaeead2d4dd0bb2f0e79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,82,97,61,36,142,161,182,245,125,234,238,173,45,77,208,187,47,14,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
