Recorded in their home-state of Rhode Island at Machines With Magnets, Fits of Reason is inspired by the writings of Omar Khayyam, Christopher Hitchens, and Plato, among others, and grapples with the human condition in a smooth but unapologetic departure from the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous release, Salt for Salt. With the introduction of electric guitar, electric bass, and a more prominent display of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Middle Eastern, metal, and psych-rock influences, Fits of Reason delves into heavier territory and invites the listener to hear with discerning ears.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8ecbbc1f5644c06cc6094c7efd587b2ca5ac460","amp;dn":"Brown+Bird+-+Fits+of+Reason+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8ecbbc1f5644c06cc6094c7efd587b2ca5ac460","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,236,187,193,245,100,76,6,204,96,148,199,239,213,135,178,202,90,196,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
