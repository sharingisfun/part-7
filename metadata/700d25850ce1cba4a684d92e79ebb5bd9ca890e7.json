Rising above her class (her widowed mother has a grocery shop), Angel finds a publisher and a wide audience for her frothy romances. With royalties, she buys an estate, then she's smitten by Esme, a rake from local aristocracy and an artist of dark temperament. She hires Esme's sister Nora, who dotes on her, as a personal assistant, and pursues Esme. Angel is grandly self-centered, coloring her world as if it were one of her novels. When the Great War breaks out and reality begins to trump her will, can Angel hold on to her man and her public?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:700d25850ce1cba4a684d92e79ebb5bd9ca890e7","amp;dn":"Angel+2007+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"700d25850ce1cba4a684d92e79ebb5bd9ca890e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,13,37,133,12,225,203,164,166,132,217,46,121,235,181,189,156,168,144,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
