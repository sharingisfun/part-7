Kennedy, and help us understand its impact in the context of ancient mythology. Herein lies the power of The Power of Myth, showing how humans are apt to create and live out the themes of mythology. Based on a six-part PBS television series hosted by Bill Moyers, this classic is especially compelling because of its engaging question-and-answer format, creating an easy, conversational approach to complicated and esoteric topics. For example, when discussing the mythology of heroes, Campbell and Moyers smoothly segue from the Sumerian sky goddess Inanna to Star Wars' mercenary-turned-hero, Han Solo. Most impressive is Campbell's encyclopedic knowledge of myths, demonstrated in his ability to recall the details and archetypes of almost any story, from any point and history, and translate it into a lesson for spiritual living in the here and now. --Gail Hudson","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f54c8c23a542d37dd426b1ccd381ec490ef41d84","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1991%5D+The+Power+of+Myth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f54c8c23a542d37dd426b1ccd381ec490ef41d84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,76,140,35,165,66,211,125,212,38,177,204,211,129,236,73,14,244,29,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
