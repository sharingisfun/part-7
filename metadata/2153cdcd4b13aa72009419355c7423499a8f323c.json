Being the second busiest crime lab in America, CSI officers use the best scientific and technical methods to solve puzzles and catch criminals.\n\nThe Las Vegas PD Criminalistics Division is the #2 crime lab in the US, solving crimes that practically every other crime lab has given up on. Led by hard-nosed Captain Jim Brass and quirky Gil Grissom, they track down perpetrators using scientific analysis and the occasional leap in logic.\n\nIn the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, its reputation for providing instant success for those willing to try their luck draws in the hopeful and the naive.

Unfortunately for them, most are proven wrong by the Las Vegas Police Department's night shift Crime Scene Investigations unit led by Gill Grissom. With almost obsessive dedication towards his quest for the facts, he and his elite team of investigators work various perplexing cases using scientific skills and equipment that are capable of finding valuable clues from the most seemingly unlikely sources.
