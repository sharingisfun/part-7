Produced by George Martin for EMI's Parlophone Records, it contains fourteen songs in its original British form, of which seven appeared in the film. The North American version, the band's eighth Capitol Records album and tenth overall, includes the songs in the film plus selections from the orchestral score composed and conducted by Ken Thorne, which contains one of the first uses of the Indian sitar on a rock/pop album. &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; is the only song on the American release in duophonic stereo (also known as &quot;fake stereo&quot;) reprocessed from the mono mix. This album is available on CD as part of The Capitol Albums, Volume 2 box set. This set also includes the mono version of the American release, which is purely a stereo-to-mono fold-down mix, including the &quot;fake stereo&quot; duophonic &quot;Ticket To Ride&quot; folded down to mono, despite Capitol already having the mono mixes for the single releases of both that song and &quot;Help!&quot;. A second CD release of this album, which contained the seven songs in true mono was issued in 2014 individually and part of the Beatles The U.S. Albums boxed set.\n\nThe American version of &quot;Help!&quot; reached the number one spot on the Billboard album charts for nine weeks starting on 11 September 1965.\n\nTrack Listing [US - REMASTER] [320k MP3]\n\nMONO &amp; STEREO - REMASTERS\n\n01 \t&quot;Help!&quot; (intro based on &quot;The James Bond Theme&quot;) Lennon \t2:39\n02. \t&quot;The Night Before&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:36\n03. \t&quot;From Me to You Fantasy&quot; (instrumental \t2:08\n04. \t&quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;   \tLennon \t2:12\n05. \t&quot;I Need You&quot; (Harrison) \tHarrison \t2:31\n06. \t&quot;In the Tyrol&quot; (Ken Thorne) \tinstrumental \t2:26\n07. \t&quot;Another Girl&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:08\n08. \t&quot;Another Hard Day's Night&quot; instrumental \t2:31\n09. \t&quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;   \tLennon with McCartney \t3:07\n10. \t&quot;Medley: The Bitter End /You Can't Do That&quot; \t2:26\n11. \t&quot;You're Going to Lose That Girl&quot;   \tLennon \t2:19\n12. \t&quot;The Chase&quot; (Ken Thorne) \tinstrumental \t2:31","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9c5d9f94526dccbe4691df1e91ed2423227c4be","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Help%21+%5BUS+-+REMASTER%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9c5d9f94526dccbe4691df1e91ed2423227c4be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,197,217,249,69,38,220,203,228,105,29,241,233,30,210,66,50,39,196,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
