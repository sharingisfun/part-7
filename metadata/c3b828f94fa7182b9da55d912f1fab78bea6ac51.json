Although this one is quite better and more sophisticated in it's beauty and lesbianism, a great nunsploitation flick for the beginner and the already fan of the genre. Enjoy!\n\nConvent with its orders and regulations. Orders are very tough, prioress are real beasts - any violation - immediately punished. And in this situation, a newcomer, is accused of possessed to the devil.\n\nReview: Take this film just for the sake of Eva Grimaldi () - very nice to me actress. So this is the Eva plays the main role of a girl who arrived in the monastery. Female monastery with their orders and regulations. Orders of tough prioress those still beast - any violation immediately punished. In this situation, a novice (her, by the way, call Suzanne) and accused possessed by the devil.\n\nDawn of Italian horror has not bypassed many of the themes - that's got nuns. And that - the monastery is the scene for a horror fits perfectly: an enclosed space, vivid characters you can think of - plus plaque mystics always appropriate. &quot;Convent Of Sinners&quot; - dare I call the best film on the subject. Joe D'Amato, who had made a career for a lot of trash managed to please a good movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3b828f94fa7182b9da55d912f1fab78bea6ac51","amp;dn":"La+Monaca+Nel+Peccato+-+Convent+of+Sinners+%281986%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3b828f94fa7182b9da55d912f1fab78bea6ac51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,184,40,249,79,167,24,43,157,165,93,145,47,31,171,120,190,166,172,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
