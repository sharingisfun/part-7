Later on in her life she is forced to confront reality when she travels to Moscow with her family, and as a teenager, finds out all about all the wonders of the world, including love, jobs and friendship, all seen through an impossibly optimistic and offbeat sensibility. Mermaid plays like the second coming of Amelie, and everything about it is utterly charming; the fantastically upbeat, jazzy score, the dreamy cinematography tinged with realism, the quirky scenarios, but mostly the utterly charismatic and awesome central performances from the two girls playing Alisa, who like Audrey Tatou before them, will make you fall in love. Alisa is such an endearingly odd character, charmingly offbeat and naive, while remaining startlingly independent and fierce. A last act stumble provoked by a tangle of superfluous characters dampens the charm of the film somewhat,and it meanders in parts, but on the whole Mermaid is an almost note-perfect film that will leave you with a dreamy smile on your face and a longing for days of lost innocence. \n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Rusalka (2007).mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 472 Kbps\nLength            : 1.97 GiB for 1h 54mn 21s 520ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 015 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 556 (1.842) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : ru\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995747/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995747/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Russian\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese\n\nMy rip\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14d04c5478d8eb4a6cbb53ae43194407d2a72dc9","amp;dn":"Rusalka+AKA+Mermaid+%28Anna+Melikyan+2007%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14d04c5478d8eb4a6cbb53ae43194407d2a72dc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,208,76,84,120,216,235,74,108,187,83,174,67,25,68,7,210,167,45,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
