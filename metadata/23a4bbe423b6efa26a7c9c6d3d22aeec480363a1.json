Janne has been playing with Children of Bodom since 1997, and on the year of 2000 created a musical project focused on instrumental work, which would only have guest singers on a few selected songs. The first incarnation of Warmen was composed of Janne, guitarist Sami Virtanen and drummer Mirka Rantanen. This line-up successfully recorded and released the Unknown Soldier album in the same year of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s formation, with the collaboration of guest singer Kimberly Goss (Sinergy), guitarist Roope Latvala (Children of Bodom) and bassist Jari Kainulainen (Stratovarius).\n\nOn the following year, the band saw the addition of Lauri Porra and JanneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitarist brother, Antti Wirman. This line-up proceeded to record on the Warmen Productions Studio (now named Beyond Abilities) the album Beyond Abilities, a speed metal album that received critical appraisal. With a more presence and diversity in the vocals, this album made use of the talent of Timo Kotipelto, Pasi NykÃƒÂ¤nen (Throne of Chaos) and returning vocalist Kimberly Goss.\n\nTheir third album, Accept the Fact was released in June of 2005.\n\nWarmen have released 4 albums so far: Ã¢â‚¬ËœUnknown SoldierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in 2001 and Ã¢â‚¬ËœBeyond AbilitiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in 2002. The band went quiet for a couple of years due to JanneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commitment to Children of Bodom, but then in 2005 they returned with Ã¢â‚¬ËœAccept The FactÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ featuring the cover of Ã¢â‚¬ËœSomebodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Watching MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with Alexi Laiho on vocals.\n\n\nCode\nCurrent members:\n\nJanne Viljami Wirman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards (2000Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nMirka Rantanen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (2000Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n   \nAntti Wirman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars (2001Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n   \nJyri Helko Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (2009Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nFormer members:\n\nSami Virtanen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars (2000Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2009)\n\nLauri Porra Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (2000Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2009)\n\nWarmen - First Of The Five Elements (2014)\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
