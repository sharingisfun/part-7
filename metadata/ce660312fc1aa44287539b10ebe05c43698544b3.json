Unexpectedly, they open a rip in space through which comes a menace unlike any our world has ever seen - the Zodiac Killer. His singular goal is death, and it falls to Bishop, Bell, and Nina Sharp to stop him.\n\nBook 02 - The Burning Man\nIn 1982, Olivia Dunham was part of Walter BishopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret experiments into the effects of Cortexiphan. Though she didn't realize it then, the drug unlocked abilities that would take years to mature. When they did, the results would be explosive... and deadly. As she grew, Olivia sought to escape a violent life, but no matter where she ran, her past caught up to her. Until she couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t run any more.\n\nBook 03 - Sins of the Father \nIn 2008, Peter Bishop is estranged from his father and running shady operations in Southeast Asia. His latest scam lands him in a life-or-death situation involving weird events beyond the ken of modern science. On the run, he finds himself pursued by strange specters of his pastÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and his future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce660312fc1aa44287539b10ebe05c43698544b3","amp;dn":"Fringe+Series+-+Christa+Faust","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce660312fc1aa44287539b10ebe05c43698544b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,102,3,18,252,26,164,66,135,83,155,16,235,224,92,67,105,133,68,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
