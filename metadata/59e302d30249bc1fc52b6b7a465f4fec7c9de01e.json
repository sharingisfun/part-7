And why, despite this difficulty, are some people so good at it? If thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some inborn capacity for mathematical thinkingÃ¢â‚¬â€which there must be, otherwise no one could do it Ã¢â‚¬â€why canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t we all do it well? Keith Devlin has answers to all these difficult questions, and in giving them shows us how mathematical ability evolved, why itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a part of language ability, and how we can make better use of this innate talent.He also offers a breathtakingly new theory of language developmentÃ¢â‚¬â€that language evolved in two stages, and its main purpose was not communicationÃ¢â‚¬â€to show that the ability to think mathematically arose out of the same symbol-manipulating ability that was so crucial to the emergence of true language. Why, then, canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t we do math as well as we can speak? The answer, says Devlin, is that we can and doÃ¢â‚¬â€we just donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recognize when weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re using mathematical reasoning.\nGenre: Non-Fiction&gt; Mathematics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59e302d30249bc1fc52b6b7a465f4fec7c9de01e","amp;dn":"Math+Gene%2C+The+-+Keith+Devlin.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59e302d30249bc1fc52b6b7a465f4fec7c9de01e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,227,2,211,2,73,188,31,197,43,107,122,70,95,79,236,124,157,224,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
