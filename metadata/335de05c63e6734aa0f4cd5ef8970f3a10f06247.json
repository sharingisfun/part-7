Levels you visit will now stay saved for 20 minutes, and will respawn after that. It may increase in the future, but I'd like to see it played first before I change it.\r\nNEW CREW GUNS\r\nBashien Flash Gun\r\nSuna Seed Dart\r\nKaidun Dynamite\r\nKursha Stun Prod\r\n\r\nBUGS FIXED\r\nFixed a game crash in a human space encounter\r\nFixed a bug where ships would &quot;flip&quot; nonstop during combat\r\nFixed a bug where crew would try to face an enemy on a ledge and then fall off it\r\nFixed a floating resources\r\nFixed a bug where crewmen would not be entertained by leaving the ship\r\n\r\nOther\r\nSeveral maps will change over time now, with more to come.\r\nNew Random Event\r\nThe prices of all the crew guns have been adjusted\r\nPathfinding should feel a lot &quot;quicker&quot;\r\nWhat is to come:\r\nThere will be a slight gap in updates in the next month with some bigger things on the horizon, so I wanted to warn the players ahead of time!\r\nI have additional content which I am very excited about, but do not want to itemize here until it's complete.\r\nNew/Shorter Tutorial\r\nOverhaul of UI\r\nIt is mostly UI and Tutorial will take a bit longer than past updates. It's asked about a lot, and it's just one of those things that is a bit more time consuming but has been on our radar!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:335de05c63e6734aa0f4cd5ef8970f3a10f06247","amp;dn":"Interstellaria+%28v1.07B%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"335de05c63e6734aa0f4cd5ef8970f3a10f06247","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,93,224,92,99,230,115,74,160,244,205,94,248,151,15,58,16,240,98,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
