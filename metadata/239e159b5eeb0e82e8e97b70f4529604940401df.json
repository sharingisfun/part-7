It is unclear how much of the mythological Geryon's connection to the story's Geryon is literal, and how much is metaphorical. Sexually abused by his older brother, his affectionate mother too weak-willed to protect him, the monstrous young boy finds solace in photography and in a romance with a young man named Herakles. Herakles leaves his young lover at the peak of Geryon's infatuation; when Geryon comes across Herakles several years later on a trip to Argentina, Herakles' new lover Ancash forms the third point of a love triangle. The novel ends, ambiguously, with Geryon, Ancash, and Herakles stopping outside a bakery near a volcano.\nThe book also contains Carson's very loose translation of the Geryoneis fragments, using many anachronisms and taking many liberties, and some discussion of both Stesichorus and the Geryon myth, including a fictional interview with &quot;Stesichorus,&quot; a veiled reference to Gertrude Stein.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:239e159b5eeb0e82e8e97b70f4529604940401df","amp;dn":"The+Autobiography+of+Red+-+Anne+Carson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"239e159b5eeb0e82e8e97b70f4529604940401df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,158,21,155,94,235,14,130,232,233,123,112,244,82,150,4,148,4,1,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
