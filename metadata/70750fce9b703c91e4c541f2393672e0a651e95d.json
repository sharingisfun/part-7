The movie addresses the various hardships that an individual can face while doing time in prison. The hardships can stem from being exposed to a tight brutal gang network within or from a corrupt correctional system. The movie is in essence seen through the eyes of rookie correctional officer Brian (Clu Gulager). Brian is at first enthusiastic about his new job as a prison guard. It however does not take long before he becomes disillusioned with the police corruption he witnesses. The movie itself however centers on two new inmates, Jonathan Paige (Alan Alda) a college professor convicted of manslaughter and Allan Campbell, a young teenager arrested for drugs. Jonathan and Allan quickly become friends despite their different backgrounds. Unfortunately Allan also befriends Hugo Slocum (Vic Morrow) the prison gang leader who has in fact taken a physical liking toward him. In the meantime, Jonathan accepts a position as a pharmacist and meets Lennox (Billy Dee Williams), a black idealist. It is in the pharmacy that Jonathan first collides with Hugo by refusing to become a fellow supplier in the drug trafficking business. Jonathan further draws Hugo's ire when he begins to protest Hugo's advances on Allan. The building tension between Jonathan and Hugo is such that both Lennox and Brian notice and become involved in their own way. It is only a matter of time before Jonathan decides that he has no alternative but to have a deadly confrontation with Hugo\n   \nSinopse Pt Br:\n\nProfessor universitÃƒÂ¡rio mata acidentalmente um homem, e cumpre pena em penitenciÃƒÂ¡ria de Utah, e lÃƒÂ¡ descobre a realidade por trÃƒÂ¡s das prisÃƒÂµes.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70750fce9b703c91e4c541f2393672e0a651e95d","amp;dn":"The+Glass+House+%5BVic+Morrow%5D+%281972%29+DVDRip+Oldies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70750fce9b703c91e4c541f2393672e0a651e95d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,117,15,206,155,112,60,145,228,197,65,242,57,54,114,224,166,81,233,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
