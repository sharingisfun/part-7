This CD is an extraordinary creation, which combines some original songs and some classics. Produced by Linda Ronstadt and George Massengill, it offer lush, rich sounds which really do Warm Your Heart.\n\nNeville's voice is at it's best. Several songs include duet vocals with Linda Ronstadt or Rita Coolidge. Ry Cooder plays guitar on several tracks.\n\nThis was the first Aaron Neville album I purchased, after first becoming a fan of his from hearing him sing on one of Linda Ronstadt's albums that he did duets on. Since then, I've purchased many more and my family knows they can't go wrong buying me an Aaron Neville CD for a gift.\n\nAs I listen to this album, writing this review, I get chills. It is by far my favorite of all his albums. I even bought a back-up copy. Maybe it's the orchestration and production of Linda Ronstadt. Maybe he just found his peak performance mode when recording these songs.\n\nWhatever it is, this CD is one I have listened to at least 50 times, and I expect it will continue to have its staying power for me.\n\nBy the way, one of the reasons I bought this CD was the title. I have lectured for over 15 years on heart warming and have written about it too. Check out my website in my about me section to find links. IN that research, I explored, using computerized psychophysiological monitoring devices how people respond to heartwarming memories and thoughts. While I have not put this CD to the test, I am sure it would produce similar results. It really does go deep.\n\n\nAaron Neville - Warm Your Heart\n\nArtist...............: Aaron Neville\nAlbum................: Warm Your Heart\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1991\n\nMP3 320cbr\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTracklisting\n\n1.
