This guide by architectural historian Jon Cannon uses high-quality photographs and diagrams to help us to analyze the leading changes in style from the Anglo-Saxon period, through the Romanesque as far as Gothic and Perpendicular. By identifying various clues left by each period, he enables us to date architectural features and styles, and explains the technical terms applied to them. If you have ever wondered how your church or cathedral developed, and want to know your triforium from your blind arcade or your vault from your hammerbeam, all the answers are here.\n\nAbout the Author\nJon Cannon is the author of Cathedral: The Great English Cathedrals and the World that Made Them and the presenter of BBC TV's How to Build a Cathedral. His is a lecturer at the University of Bristol, Marlborough College and elsewhere, and has published academic papers and edited volumes.
