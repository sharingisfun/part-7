To show how much new stuff has been added, the previous torrent was about 40MB...  In the future this will be updated as well, this is just what I have organized so far.\n\nThe firearms discussed:\n\nAK-47, AR-15/M-16, AR-7, Cobray M-11-9 Pistol, Colt M1911/M1911A1, Glock 17/18, HK-91, HK-94, Uzi, Mac-10, Marlin .22, Ruger 10-22, Ruger Mini-14, SKS, Tec-9 and KG-99.  While the list remains about the same from the previous torrent, the amount of literature on the firearms has roughly doubled.\n\nFurthermore, there are numerous articles on general full-auto conversion, and the tools and techniques used to do so.\n\n~~~\n\nI am always adding new things, so check this account often.\n\nVisit roguesci (dot) org (slash) theforum, and register, for the world's longest running largest explosives and weapons forum on the web!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f73068c9dfd68ede79df7d6e27a0d63256006e8f","amp;dn":"Full+Auto+Conversion+Guide+Collection-+Update+%232","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f73068c9dfd68ede79df7d6e27a0d63256006e8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,48,104,201,223,214,142,222,121,223,125,110,39,160,214,50,86,0,110,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
