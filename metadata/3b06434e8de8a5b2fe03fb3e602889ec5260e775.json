After being released from a prison ship at the shores of the island Vvardenfell, the protagonist may do more or less what he or she wants: follow the main quest and solve the mystery of an ancient prophecy, join any of roughly a dozen guilds and rise in their hierarchy by performing duties, or simply explore the gigantic island with its stylistically diverse cities, hundreds of dungeons and tombs, ancient ruins and mighty fortresses.\n\n-------------------------\nMorrowind information:\n-------------------------\n\nPublished by: Ubi Soft Entertainment Software\nDeveloped by: Bethesda Softworks LLC\nReleased: 2002\nPlatforms: Windows\nGenre: Action, Role-Playing (RPG),Adventure\nPerspective :1st-Person Perspective, 3rd-Person Perspective\nESRB Rating: Teen\n\n----------------------\nTorrent description:\n----------------------\n\nThis torrent contains Morrowind, the Tribunal and Bloodmoon expansions and the latest patches, Morrowind Overhaul 3.0 Installed and more extra mods installed.\n\nTested on Windows XP 32 bit and Windows 7 32bit.\n\n--------------\nInstructions:\n--------------\n\n1.Unrar MorrowindGOTY2013\n\n2.Open the game with Morrowind Launcher.exe, start a new game or play with the options then exit.
