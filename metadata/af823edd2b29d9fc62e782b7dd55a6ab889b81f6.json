And whether we'd be (un)lucky enough to see it. This book explores some of the theories about the end of days, looking from religion to science and everything in between. Some are silly enough to laugh at, others might scare you to death. Either way, you'll find the End is nigh; it's right between these pages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af823edd2b29d9fc62e782b7dd55a6ab889b81f6","amp;dn":"The+Little+Book+of+the+End+of+the+World+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStorm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af823edd2b29d9fc62e782b7dd55a6ab889b81f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,130,62,221,43,41,217,252,98,231,130,183,221,85,166,171,136,155,129,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
