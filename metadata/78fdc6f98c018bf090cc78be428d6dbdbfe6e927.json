We will put your call on hold and dial our recording line. As soon as our line answers tap the merge button on your screen to create a 3 way call between your other caller and our recording line. \n\nIf you want to record an outgoing call, just press the record button. The app will dial our recording line and will begin recording as soon as our line answers. Once that happens, tap the add call button on your screen, call the person you want to record, then press the merge button when they answer. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€ \n\nCan I download recordings to my computer? \n\nYes, and we've made it extremely easy to do this. From inside the app you can attach the recording to an email and send it to yourself as an MP3, or you can click the share button and find a short URL that you can type into your computer's browser. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬â€ \n\nHow many recordings can I make? \n\nAs many as you want!

Please keep in mind that 3-way calling will use your airtime minutes. Also, carriers outside the US may charge for long distance calls, so be sure to check if TapeACall is long distance for you. If it is, you may be able to get around this by adding TapeACall's access number as one of your &quot;Fav&quot; numbers so you can call it without additional airtime usage or carriers fees. If we don't have an access number that is considered local by your carrier, please contact us and we'll try to get one for you!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78fdc6f98c018bf090cc78be428d6dbdbfe6e927","amp;dn":"TapeACall+Pro+-+Calls+Recorder+V+3.2.2+For+IPhone.ipa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78fdc6f98c018bf090cc78be428d6dbdbfe6e927","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,253,198,249,140,1,139,240,144,204,120,190,66,141,109,189,191,230,233,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
