He's not too keen on the series, mostly because he's not sure how to tackle the subject. Then it dawns on him: if he was to pretend to all and sundry that he was Jewish, he could then experience the degree of racism and prejudice that exists and write his story from that perspective. It takes little time for him to experience bigotry. His anger at the way he is treated also affects his relationship with Kathy Lacy, his publisher's niece and the person who suggested the series in the first place.\n\n\nBRRip 480p | MKV | 658 x 480 | x264 600kbps 23.976fps | HE-AACv2 64kbps 2CH\nLanguage: English | Subtitle: English Included | 1h 58mn\n\n\nSource : TinyBearDs (Thanks)\n\n\n                           ------------------\n                          | Kindly seed back |\n                           ------------------\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b627de3e53ac267206f5c038d375d721084b3326","amp;dn":"Gentleman%27s+Agreement.1947.BRRip.x264+480p+TinyBear","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b627de3e53ac267206f5c038d375d721084b3326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,39,222,62,83,172,38,114,6,245,192,56,211,117,215,33,8,75,51,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
