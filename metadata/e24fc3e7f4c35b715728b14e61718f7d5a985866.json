The album featured\r\nfive chart singles: &quot;If You See Him/If You See Her&quot; (#1), &quot;How Long\r\nGone&quot; (#1), &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (a cover of a Roger Miller song)\r\n(#1), &quot;I Can't Get Over You&quot; (#5), and &quot;South of Santa Fe&quot; (#41).\r\nThis last song was the first (and only) single of Brooks &amp; Dunn's\r\ncareer to miss Top 40 entirely, and was the last single to feature\r\nKix Brooks on lead vocals instead of Ronnie Dunn. The album is a\r\ncounterpart to Reba McEntire's album If You See Him (released on the\r\nsame day), which shared the track &quot;If You See Him/If You See Her&quot;. A\r\nbonus limited edition EP was made available when consumers bought\r\nboth If You See Him and If You See Her at the same time.\r\n\r\nStudio album by: Brooks &amp; Dunn\r\n\r\nReleased: June 2, 1998\r\n\r\nGenre: Country\r\n\r\nLength: 39:25\r\n\r\nLabel: Arista Nashville\r\n\r\nProducer: Kix Brooks, Don Cook, Ronnie Dunn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. Title Writer(s) Length\r\n1.\t&quot;How Long Gone&quot; Shawn Camp, John Scott Sherrill 3:40\r\n\r\n2.\t&quot;I Can't Get Over You&quot; Ronnie Dunn, Terry McBride 4:08\r\n\r\n3.\t&quot;South of Santa Fe&quot; Larry Boone, Paul Nelson, Kix Brooks 3:48\r\n\r\n4.\t&quot;If You See Him/If You See Her&quot; (with Reba McEntire) McBride, Tommy Lee James, Jennifer Kimball 3:58\r\n\r\n5.\t&quot;Brand New Whiskey&quot; Gary Stewart, Mary Lou Stewart 3:09\r\n\r\n6.\t&quot;Born and Raised in Black and White&quot; Don Cook, John Barlow Jarvis 3:55\r\n\r\n7.\t&quot;Your Love Don't Take a Backseat to Nothing&quot; McBride, Brooks, Dunn 3:28\r\n\r\n8.\t&quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; Roger Miller 3:10\r\n\r\n9.\t&quot;Way Gone&quot; Brooks, Bob DiPiero 3:11\r\n\r\n10.\t&quot;When Love Dies&quot; Chuck Cannon, Kent Robbins 3:50\r\n\r\n11.\t&quot;You're My Angel&quot; Greg Humphrey, Michael Smotherman 3:12\r\n\r\nTotal length: 39:25","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e24fc3e7f4c35b715728b14e61718f7d5a985866","amp;dn":"Brooks+and+Dunn+-+If+You+See+Her%28MP3%29%7BCTShoN%7D%5BCTRC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e24fc3e7f4c35b715728b14e61718f7d5a985866","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,79,195,231,244,195,91,113,87,40,177,78,97,113,143,125,90,152,88,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
