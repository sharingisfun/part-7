The second owner suffered a worse tragedy in 1935, when his house manager murdered him, his family, and the entire live-in staffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. Craftsmen and laborers working on renovations disappear or go madÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. For years, the Pendleton is a happy place, until a bad turn comes againÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. Voices in unknown languages are heard in deserted rooms, everywhere and nowhereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\nDisturbing shadows move along walls but have no sourceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. Images on security monitors show strange places that exist nowhere in the building or its groundsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. A young boy talks of an imaginary playmate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ who turns out to be terrifyingly realÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. A figure like a man but clearly inhuman is glimpsed in the courtyard gardens at night and in other locales, perhaps a hoaxer of some kind, seemingly oblivious of those who see it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ until it suddenly takes an interest in one of themÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n\nUnabridged.\nRead by Peter Berkrot.\n\n--------------------------\n\nVisit us:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://audiobookvault.ws&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://audiobookvault.ws&lt;/a&gt;\n--------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f821dfcadb95aee1d1edf5924acb5aa4dddaa97c","amp;dn":"77+Shadow+Street++Dean+Koontz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f821dfcadb95aee1d1edf5924acb5aa4dddaa97c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,33,223,202,219,149,174,225,209,237,245,146,74,203,90,164,221,218,169,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
