Vergil fights with only 3 weapons (Yamato, Beowulf, and Force Edge) and only has one style, Dark Slayer. He plays through the same levels as Dante but without the voiced cutscenes and behaves like him during scripted scenes. He also still fights a &quot;Vergil&quot; boss three times, however, this boss has a red coat to differentiate it from player Vergil. Players have nicknamed the character &quot;Vante&quot; to resolve confusion.\nThe game modes were shifted down so that the Special Edition's Normal mode is equivalent to the original's Easy mode, and a new Very Hard mode was added to replace the original Hard mode.\nThe Bloody Palace from Devil May Cry 2 was also added, though it ends at the 9999th floor instead of restarting, and beating it with either character allows them to obtain their first Super costume.\nThe &quot;Demo Digest&quot; mode was added. It allows the player to view any previously seen cutscene from the main menu.\nThree boss fights were created for Dante to fight the Jester character - the first of these is mandatory, while the next two are optional. Vergil can also fight him, although it is not mandatory for him either.\nThe Super glitch in the first game was corrected so that Quicksilver and Doppelganger still drain energy, even while using the Super costumes. However, the new Super Legendary Dark Knight costume was added which preserved the glitch.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n-Minimum System Requirements\nProcessor:\t1 GHz Pentium 3 or equivalent\nRAM:\t256 MB\nVideo Memory:\t128 MB\nHard Drive Space:\t3.5 GB\nOperating System:\tWindows 2000/XP\nDirectX Version:\t9.0c\n-Recommended System Requirements\nProcessor:\t2 GHz Pentium 4 or equivalent\nRAM:\t512 MB\nVideo Memory:\t128 MB\n\n\n\n\nHow to intall:\n-run instaler and choose the destination directory\n-skip direct x ,visualcc,nvidia phisix,framework instalation\n-whait until is done\n-play\n\nNote:\n-aditional videos removed\n-no crack, serial key needed\n-aplied update 1.3\n\nPlease seed after you finish the download,suport mee to seed my torrent\n\nHappy gaming","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb11d1de9b4aba1ff2116249de631df9a8cf810e","amp;dn":"DMC+3+SPECIAL+EDITION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb11d1de9b4aba1ff2116249de631df9a8cf810e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,17,209,222,155,74,186,31,242,17,98,73,222,99,29,249,168,207,129,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
