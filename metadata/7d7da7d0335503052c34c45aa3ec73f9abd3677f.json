For the latino boomers who came of age during the 60`s in the barrios of America, the Beatles were considered the best in popular rock music. Almost everyone I know has at least one Uncle who was apesh*t for this group. So it was only fitting that some of the finest Salseros including Tito Puente and Celia Cruz would collaborate to produce this gem. Some of the best songs written by the Beatles are covered in this album such as, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot;, as well as songs I never really cared for but were big anyway(&quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;,&quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;). A must have for those who dig the Beatles and Latin Jazz. Get it.\n\nby Rodrigi Lozada\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Hey Jude.wma                                                     \n02 - Let It Be.wma                                                    \n03 - Can't Buy Me Love (No Puedes Comprarme).wma                      \n04 - A Hard Day's Night.wma                                           \n05 - Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.wma                                           \n06 - The Fool On The Hill.wma                                         \n07 - I Want To Hold Your Hand.wma                                     \n08 - Day Tripper.wma                                                  \n09 - Lady Madonna.wma                                                 \n10 - With A Little Help From My Friends (La Ayuda De La Amistad).wma  \n11 - Yesterday.wma                                                    \n12 - And I Love Her (Mi Gran Amor Le Di).wma                          \n13 - Come Together (Venir Juntos).wma \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\n\nFollow Me On Facebook Pages: MarcelodrgzTPB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d7da7d0335503052c34c45aa3ec73f9abd3677f","amp;dn":"V.A.+-+Tribute+Tropical+To+The+Beatles+%281996%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d7da7d0335503052c34c45aa3ec73f9abd3677f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,125,167,208,51,85,3,5,44,52,196,90,163,236,115,249,171,211,103,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
