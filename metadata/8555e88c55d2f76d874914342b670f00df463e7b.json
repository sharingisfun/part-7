Our queen is different! She never changed anything to gold, but her magic touch altered the course of history. This queen is none other than 'Mathematics'- the undisputed queen of all sciences! We cannot imagine a single branch of science where the influence of mathematics is not felt.\nOver the years, mathematics has grown to be the strongest scientific discipline ever, and some great mathematicians paved the way for its present glory.\nThis issue of 'Tell Me Why' portrays some of the legendary mathematicians who changed the course of history, with their astonishing ability to make numbers work in magical ways.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s4.postimg.org/r92l2br1p/Great_Mathematicians_Tell_Me_Why_99.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s4.postimg.org/r92l2br1p/Great_Mathematicians_Tell_Me_Why_99.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8555e88c55d2f76d874914342b670f00df463e7b","amp;dn":"Great+Mathematicians+%28Tell+Me+Why+%2399%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8555e88c55d2f76d874914342b670f00df463e7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,85,232,140,85,210,247,109,135,73,20,52,43,103,15,0,223,70,62,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
