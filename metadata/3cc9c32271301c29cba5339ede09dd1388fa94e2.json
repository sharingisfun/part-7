Ally even followed Billy to Harvard law school despite having no interest in law. But when Billy chose to pursue a career in law away from Ally, their relationship came to an end. In the present, an old classmate of Ally's named Richard Fish gives Ally a job at his law firm, where Billy and his new wife are also working. This puts Ally in a predicament since she still has feelings for Billy which she's laboring to get over. At the office, Ally puts up with a nosy, gossiping secretary named Elaine, and an oddball lawyer named John Cage never seems to lose a case. At home, Ally's friend and house-mate RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e regularly advises her on her love life. The series follows Ally's trials and tribulations in life through her eyes, and caricaturizes her personal thoughts and fantasies.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cc9c32271301c29cba5339ede09dd1388fa94e2","amp;dn":"Ally+McBeal++%28The+Collector%5C%27s+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cc9c32271301c29cba5339ede09dd1388fa94e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,201,195,34,113,48,28,41,203,165,51,158,222,9,221,19,136,250,148,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
