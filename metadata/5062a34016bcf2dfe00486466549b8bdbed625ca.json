This includes &quot;The Story of the Year,&quot; &quot;The Return,&quot; and all the issues up to this month's &quot;The Khromium Age&quot; -- the last from Larsen.\n\n------\nSupreme  041-042 (Image, 1996)\nSupreme  043-048 (Maximum, 1996-97)\nSupreme  049-051, 052a, 052b, 053-056 (Awesome, 1997-1998)\nSupreme: The Return 001-006 (Awesome, 1999-2000)\nSupreme  063-068 (Image, 2012-13)\n------\n\nAlan Moore won the 1997 Eisner Award for his Supreme scripts (and for From Hell). Did you know that out of 24 Best Writer Eisners, that guy has won 9 of them?!\n\nI don't look forward to Rob Liefeld taking over this title.\n\nIf you look at his record when he's been *ahem* responsible for writing or scheduling or publishing ANYTHING, it's went to shit. For example, Supreme: Eric Stephenson, now Image's Publisher, was editing it and he (not Rob) got Alan Moore to write it. 15 issues came out from August 1996 to November 1997 -- 16 if you count #52 as two comics, which I don't.\n\nBy the end of that critically-acclaimed and popular run, Rob had begun his Maximum Press imprint, then had dropped it, and then had started Awesome Comics -- after he was caught embezzling funds from Image AND was fired by Marvel off his two Heroes Reborn titles. Rob followed up with only 7 Supreme issues in 2 years (#56 and &quot;The Return&quot; 1-6) and didn't even publish the last story Alan Moore turned in.\n\nFlash forward to 2012 and the PROFESSIONALS seem to be getting pushed out after revamping or revisiting Liefeld's old characters in the Youngblood, Bloodstrike, Glory, Prophet and Supreme revivals. Erik Larsen -- another Image founder -- had deadline issues, but put out 6 good Supreme issues in 10 months. He and artist Cory Hamscher built upon the rich tapestry woven by Alan Moore (and artists like Chris Sprouse and Rick Veitch) in the 1990s.\n\n------\n\nAnyway, I'll step off my soapbox now. If you like superheroes but you've never read this book, give it a try. You'll be glad you did.\n\nAll credit to the original scanners! These include Zone-Empire, Nahga-Empire, and probably a dozen others who did the work on the older issues.
