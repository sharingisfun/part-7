The EPUB specification is a powerful method for creating gorgeous ebooks for EPUB-capable readers such as the iPad, Nook, and Kindle. Alas, it is far from perfect, with frustrating limitations, sketchy documentation, and incomplete creation tools. This extensively researched guide to creating EPUB files by best-selling author Elizabeth Castro shows you how to prepare EPUB files, make the files look great on the screen, work around EPUB weaknesses, and fix common errors. In this essential book, Liz shares her hard-earned experience for how to:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCreate EPUB files from existing Microsoft Word or Adobe InDesign files,\n        or from scratch\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tTweak EPUB files to take full advantage of the power of EPUB in each \n        respective ereader\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tControl spacing, indents, and margins.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tInsert images and sidebars and wrap text around them.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCreate links to external sources and cross-references to internal ones\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAdd video to ebooks for the iPad.\n\n\nProduct Details:\n\nFile size: epub 5.94 MB, mobi 6.91 MB\nPublisher: Peachpit Press\nASIN: B004519O4I\nLanguage: English\n\n\n\nNotes: I have checked various chapter and website links with both file types.
