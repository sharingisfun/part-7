They were one of the most successful of the 1980s bands and a leading band in the MTV-driven &quot;Second British Invasion&quot; of the United States. Since the 1980s they have placed 14 in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100 and have sold more than 100 million records.[7] While the group were generally considered part of the New Romantic scene, along with bands such as Spandau Ballet, when they first emerged, they later shed this image. The band worked with fashion designers to build a sharp and elegant image that earned them the nickname &quot;the prettiest boys in rock&quot;.[8] The band's controversial videos-which included partial nudity and suggestions of sexuality- became popular in the early 1980s on the then-new music video channel, MTV. The band were among the first bands to have their videos shot by professional directors with 35 mm film movie cameras, which gave their videos a much more polished look. In 1984, the band were early innovators with video technology in their live stadium shows.\n\nThe band was created by Nick Rhodes, John Taylor and Stephen Duffy, with the later addition of Roger Taylor and, after numerous personnel changes, Andy Taylor, and Simon Le Bon (none of the Taylors are related.) The group has never disbanded, but the line-up has changed to include guitarist Warren Cuccurullo from 1989 to 2001, and drummer Sterling Campbell from 1989 to 1991. The reunion of the original five members in the early 2000s created a stir among the band's fans and music media.[9][10] Andy Taylor left the band in summer 2006, and London guitarist Dom Brown has since been working with the band as a session player and touring member. A full time replacement guitarist for Andy Taylor so far has not been appointed.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits 1998\n\n\nGreatest is a greatest hits compilation album released in 1998 by the band Duran Duran.\n\n\nGreatest was an update of the 1989 tenth anniversary compilation album, Decade: Greatest Hits. The new release included songs from their eponymous debut album through 1997's Medazzaland. The album includes all 14 songs featured in Decade: Greatest Hits, plus &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot; and four singles from the 90's, however both &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; and &quot;Rio&quot; are presented in their shorter US versions in order to fit on a single CD whereas they appeared in their full versions on the former compilation.\n\nThe album was released by EMI after parting ways with the band after the disastrous Medazzaland album release in 1997, and marked the first of many releases designed to capitalize on the band's extensive EMI-controlled back catalog.\n\nTo coincide with the release of the Greatest album in the United Kingdom, the song &quot;Electric Barbarella&quot; was released as a single. This track was originally released as a single in North America in 1997 to promote the Medazzaland album (which was never released in the UK).\n\nAs of 2009, the collection has sold over a million copies in the United States.[1] To date, a full collection of Duran Duran's singles on one album still hasn't been released.\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n2.\t&quot;The Reflex&quot; [7&quot; version] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24\n3.\t&quot;A View to a Kill&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n4.\t&quot;Ordinary World (Single Version)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n5.\t&quot;Save a Prayer (US Single Version)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n6.\t&quot;Rio (US Edit)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n7.\t&quot;Hungry Like the Wolf (Edit)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n8.\t&quot;Girls on Film&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n9.\t&quot;Planet Earth (Single Version)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n10.\t&quot;Union of the Snake&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n11.\t&quot;New Moon on Monday&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n12.\t&quot;The Wild Boys&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n13.\t&quot;Notorious&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n14.\t&quot;I Don't Want Your Love (Shep Pettibone 7&quot; Mix)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n15.\t&quot;All She Wants Is (45 Mix)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n16.\t&quot;Electric Barbarella (Edit)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n17.\t&quot;Serious (Edit)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n18.\t&quot;Skin Trade (Radio Cut)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n19.\t&quot;Come Undone (Edit)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31a1dde2f318178975eb59ad50cbd260db5d94c2","amp;dn":"Duran+Duran+-+Greatest+Hits+1998+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31a1dde2f318178975eb59ad50cbd260db5d94c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,161,221,226,243,24,23,137,117,235,89,173,80,203,210,96,219,93,148,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
