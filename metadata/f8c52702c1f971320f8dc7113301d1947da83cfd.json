Unfortunately, that is all that's available on DVD, but don't worry - every single episode is here, though the source quality does vary for other series. Series 5 to 7 of AHP are nearly all excellent quality television rips, series 2 and 3 of TAHH are VHS quality, but hey it's the best there is right now. If you know otherwise, or have better copies, please share them with us.\n\nI am particularly proud of the extras gathered together here, almost certainly some of which will be new to you.

I am certain that these represent the best available copies of each of these shows right now. Please download and help me to seed, this is a very large upload, and I expect it will take me a week to seed to 100%, give or take a day. Please help me out from the beginning. This should be seeded NEARLY 24 hours a day at some speed, though there will be parts of the day where my upload speed drops, and very occasionally I may have to reboot the PC or do some maintenance. Don't panic! I'll seed this until there are plenty of seeds, if I'm offline for an hour or 2 it won't make a difference, I'll be back. Until I am, it's up to you to share the data you have.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8c52702c1f971320f8dc7113301d1947da83cfd","amp;dn":"Alfred+Hitchcock+-+The+Complete+TV+Megapack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8c52702c1f971320f8dc7113301d1947da83cfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,197,39,2,193,249,113,50,15,141,199,17,51,1,209,148,125,168,60,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
