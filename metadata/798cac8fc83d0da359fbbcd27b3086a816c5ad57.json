But behind the intellect of this caustic, impatient man is a heart full of compassion and kindness that will change the Kirsanov's lives forever.\nWhen Ivan Turgenev first published this novel in 1862, the populace of his native Russia was so enraged by the character of Bazarov that Turgenev was forced to flee the country for France. However, critics have praised the novel for its subtle irony and richly crafted characters.\n\n(P)1994 by Recorded Books, Inc.; Cover art by Tinam Valk; Ã‚Â©1994 Recorded Books, Inc.\n\nAudible Audio Edition\nListening Length: 8 hours and 24 minutes\nProgram Type: Audiobook\nVersion: Unabridged\nPublisher: Recorded Books\nAudible.com Release Date: December 16, 1999\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00005479P\n\nRead by George Guidall \nFormat: MP3 \nBitrate: 96 Kbps \nUnabridged \n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
