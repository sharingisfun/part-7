Highly readable, incisive and deeply imbued with a personal viewpoint that stresses the primacy of live performance, Wickham's erudite work is based on a lifetime's practical experience as a teacher, researcher and professional director. A History of the Theatre is the ideal introduction to the subject for all lovers of the theatre, and an authoritative textbook for students.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:039642cfaeeea45ef335e43ce68d44bf2b67122a","amp;dn":"History+of+the+Theatre+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"039642cfaeeea45ef335e43ce68d44bf2b67122a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,150,66,207,174,238,164,94,243,53,228,60,230,141,68,191,43,103,18,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
