It features the breakthrough single &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, extended with a substantial instrumental section omitted on the single release, and the lengthy song &quot;The End&quot; with its Oedipal spoken-word section. The Doors credit the success of their first album to being able to work the songs out night after night at the Whisky a Go Go or the London Fog. &quot;Alabama Song&quot; was originally written and composed by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill for their opera Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny (Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny); &quot;Back Door Man&quot; was a Howlin' Wolf cover. &quot;The End&quot;'s Oedipal climax was first performed live at the Whisky A Go Go and The Doors were thrown out as a result of lead vocalist Jim Morrison screaming &quot;Mother...I want to fuck you!&quot; near the climax of the song.\n\nAlbum Title: The Doors \nArtist | Group: The Doors \nRelease date: 1967 \nGenre: Rock \nNumber of track(s): 11 \nFile format: mp3 \nTotal duration: 00h:44m:34s:648ms \nTotal size: 103.2071 MB \n\nTrack listing:\nBreak On Through (To The Other Side)\nSoul Kitchen\nThe Crystal Ship\nTwentieth Century Fox\nAlabama Song (Whisky Bar)\nLight My Fire\nBack Door Man\nI Looked At You\nEnd Of The Night\nTake It as It Comes\nThe End\n\nENJOY \nplease seed and leave feedback\nvigoni\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e847eeac96ded95753832f982a9a3bba1b1d32c","amp;dn":"The+Doors+-+The+Doors+%5B1967+-+MP3+-+320+kbps%5D+%5Bvigoni%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e847eeac96ded95753832f982a9a3bba1b1d32c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,132,126,234,201,109,237,149,117,56,50,249,130,169,163,187,161,177,211,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
