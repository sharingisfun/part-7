But if standing and fighting is hard, leading a company of men - or worse, a company of mercenaries - against the smart, deadly creatures of the Wild is even harder.\r\n\r\nIt takes all the advantages of birth, training, and the luck of the devil to do it.\r\n\r\nThe Red Knight has all three, he has youth on his side, and he's determined to turn a profit. So when he hires his company out to protect an Abbess and her nunnery, it's just another job. The abby is rich, the nuns are pretty and the monster preying on them is nothing he can't deal with.\r\n\r\nOnly it's not just a job. It's going to be a war...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Matthew Wolf\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nUnabridged\r\n\r\nMiles Cameron - The Red Knight\r\n\r\nWritten by: Miles Cameron\r\nNarrated by: Matthew Wolf\r\nLength: 30 hrs and 31 mins\r\nSeries: Traitor Son Cycle, Book 1\r\nAudiobook\r\nRelease Date:01-22-13\r\nPublisher: Hachette Audio\r\n\r\nEncoding: Audio\r\nFormat : MPEG Audio\r\nFormat version : Version 1\r\nFormat profile : Layer 3\r\nMode : Joint stereo\r\nMode extension : MS Stereo\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 40.0 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72e0e2277211739a7d2a45cc85e5ac8942f42400","amp;dn":"Miles+Cameron+-+The+Red+Knight+%28The+Traitor+Son+Cycle+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72e0e2277211739a7d2a45cc85e5ac8942f42400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,224,226,39,114,17,115,154,125,42,69,204,133,229,172,137,66,244,36,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
