Having always been successful at everything she does, she jumps at a chance to compete in the first Galactic Teen Supreme contest. The only thing standing in her way is the lack of a hot-pod license needed for the first stage of the contest - a pod race from the earth to the Moonstock Festival on the moon. After a few near-misses during her driving test, her pod is taken over by some mysterious force that allows her to land safely on earth and get her license.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5744616cd8140236acfcfba96ddb8d04d600c6c2","amp;dn":"Zenon%3AZ3.2004.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5744616cd8140236acfcfba96ddb8d04d600c6c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,68,97,108,216,20,2,54,172,252,251,169,109,219,141,4,214,0,198,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
