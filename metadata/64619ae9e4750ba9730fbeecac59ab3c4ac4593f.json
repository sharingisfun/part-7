Are these the Ã¢â‚¬Å“signsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that God refers to in His Word? If they are, what do they mean? What is their prophetic significance?\n\nIn this riveting book, New York Times best-selling author, Pastor John Hagee, explores the supernatural connection of certain celestial events to biblical prophecyÃ¢â‚¬â€and to the future of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chosen people and to the nations of the world.\n\nJust as in biblical times, God is controlling the sun, the moon, and the stars to send our generation a signal that something big is about to happen.\n\nGenre: Biblical, Prophecy, Christian ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64619ae9e4750ba9730fbeecac59ab3c4ac4593f","amp;dn":"Four+Blood+Moons+by+John+Hagee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64619ae9e4750ba9730fbeecac59ab3c4ac4593f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,97,154,233,228,117,11,169,115,15,190,236,172,89,171,60,74,196,89,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
