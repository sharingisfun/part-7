It was written by Eric Stewart and Graham Gouldman and was the lead single from the band's 1978 album, Bloody Tourists. Lead vocals were performed by Graham Gouldman.\n\nThe lyrics, about a white man lost in Jamaica, were based on a true story told by Moody Blues vocalist Justin Hayward about an experience he had had in Barbados;  it was a rare excursion into reggae for the act. It became the act's third and final number one single in the UK, and final top 10 hit, spending a single week at the top in September 1978. The single peaked at #44 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the USA. The song was later covered by Boney M on their 1985 album, Eye Dance. A remade version using some of the lyrics, was released by the Eurodisco group French Connection under the title 'I don't like reggae' in 1993.\n\nLine up:\nEric Stewart ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ guitars, piano, moog synthesizer, vocals\nGraham Gouldman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bass, guitar, percussion, percussion, vocals\nRick Fenn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ guitar, vocals\nPaul Burgess ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ percussion, congas, drums, glockenspiel, marimba, tambourine, timbales, triangle, bells, drums, vibraphone,\nDuncan Mackay ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ synthesizer, piano, violin, keyboards, electric piano, backing vocals\nStuart Tosh ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums, percussion, tambourine, vocals, bells","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c257ba6a685766298aabcd611e9fbde998fbfcf","amp;dn":"10cc+-+Dreadlock+Holiday+%281978%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c257ba6a685766298aabcd611e9fbde998fbfcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,37,123,166,166,133,118,98,152,170,188,214,17,233,251,222,153,143,191,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
