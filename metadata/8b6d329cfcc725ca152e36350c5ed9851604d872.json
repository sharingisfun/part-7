The grim realities of clockers' \r\nlives provides the basis for this gritty drama from filmmaker Spike Lee that \r\noffers a potent message calling for poor urban blacks to quit fighting each \r\nother. The story centers on Strike, a 19-year old drug dealer who is first \r\nseen hanging out with his buddies and doing a little business on a bench \r\nin the Brooklyn projects. The trouble really begins when Strike agrees to \r\nhelp out the local drug lord Rodney by killing one of his rivals. The murder \r\noccurs, but the actual killer is never shown. Later Strike's serious, \r\nhard-working brother Victor confesses to the crime. That should be the \r\nend of that, but it isn't,as homicide detective Rocco Klein doesn't buy \r\nVictor's confession for a second. The policeman becomes obsessed with the \r\ncase and his partner Larry goes along for the ride. Klein then begins \r\nharassing his real suspect, Strike. The constant badgering makes it difficult \r\nfor Spike to conduct his business, and eventually, even his own pals begin \r\nto suspect him of the killing. Spike is further harassed by both a black cop \r\nand Rodney, who doesn't want Spike horning in on his territory.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Harvey Keitel.\r\n=&gt;-John Turturro.\r\n=&gt;-Delroy Lindo.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Spike Lee.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Drama : Crime : Thriller.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1995.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.59 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 771 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 08mn.\r\n=&gt;-Clockers 1995..............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/clockers/\r\n=&gt;-Clockers 1995..............: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/clockers-1995/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 688.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 654 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 183 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b6d329cfcc725ca152e36350c5ed9851604d872","amp;dn":"Clockers+-+Spike+Lee+Crime+1995+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b6d329cfcc725ca152e36350c5ed9851604d872","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,109,50,156,252,199,37,202,21,46,54,53,12,94,217,133,22,4,216,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
