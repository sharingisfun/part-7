This was created by sidxx55 and ps2gamer of http://deioncube.in.  I simply packaged it as an installer and made it available via torrent since it's a hard to find item.  It took me 5 bloody hours to find something that worked for modern encryption.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nReadme file contents:\n\n==============================================\nPHP5 DeZenders [NWS &amp; RM] [UPDATED 06.09.2011]\n==============================================\n\n==================\nBased on php 5.2.1\n==================\n\nIncludes the following loaders for encoded files:\n + ionCube PHP Loader v3.1.31 [CRACKED by sidxx55]\n + NuSphere PhpExpress v3.0.1 [RETAIL]\n + Zend Optimizer v3.3.3 [PATCHED by ps2gamer]\n\n========================\nSuccessfully tested with\n========================\n\n + Ioncubed files   [v6]\n + NuCoder files    [v2]\n + Zend Guard files [v5]\n\n============\nRequirements\n============\n\nMicrosoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package:\nx86: https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5582\nx64: https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=2092\n\nMicrosoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package:\nx86: https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8328\nx64: https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13523\n\nNote: If you are running windows x64, you have to install both x64 and x86 versions.\n\n==========\nHow to use\n==========\n\nDecoding a file:\n\n#1: Put dezender in a path without spaces or dots (example C:\\dezender)\n\n#2: Drag ioncubed/zended file in DECODE_NWS.bat or DECODE_RM.bat and it should produce a decoded file.\n\n---\n\nDecoding multiple files:\n\n#1: Put dezender in a path without spaces or dots (example C:\\dezender)\n\n#2: Put the program that needs dezending in _decode (the whole program is fine),\n    it will only parse php files but it will copy all other files to the decoded folder.\n\n#3: Run DECODE_NWS.bat or DECODE_RM.bat\n\n#4: Sit back, grab another beer, should be done shortly depending on the size of the program\n\n#5: Take a look in _decoded_nws or _decoded_rm (depends on the dezender used)\n\n=========\nThanks to\n=========\n\nsidxx55\nps2gamer\n\n===============================\nVisit us at http://deioncube.in\n===============================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3481a6fb3e6f635c5e9956101896d8541e7d08e","amp;dn":"Dezender-Deiconcuber+decodes+Ioncube+v6+and+NuCoder+version+2+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3481a6fb3e6f635c5e9956101896d8541e7d08e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,72,26,111,179,230,246,53,197,233,149,97,1,137,109,133,65,231,208,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
