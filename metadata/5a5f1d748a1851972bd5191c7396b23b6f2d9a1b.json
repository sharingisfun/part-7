The band is composed of founding members (and sisters) Martie Erwin Maguire and Emily Erwin Robison, and lead singer Natalie Maines. The band formed in 1989 in Dallas, Texas and was originally composed of four women performing bluegrass and country music, busking and touring the bluegrass festival circuits and small venues for six years without attracting a major label.\n\nAfter the departure of one bandmate, the replacement of their lead singer, and a slight change in their repertoire, the Dixie Chicks soon reached a large amount of commercial success, beginning in 1998 with hit songs &quot;There's Your Trouble&quot; and &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot;.\n\nDuring a London concert ten days before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, lead vocalist Maines said &quot;we don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States (George W. Bush) is from Texas&quot;.[1] The statement offended many Americans, who thought it rude and unpatriotic, and the ensuing controversy cost the band half of their concert audience attendance in the United States. The incident negatively affected their career and led to accusations of the three women being &quot;un-American&quot;, as well as hate mail, death threats, and the public destruction of their albums in protest.[2]\n\nAs of 2009, they have won 13 Grammy Awards, with 5 of them earned in 2007 including the coveted Grammy Award for Album of the Year for Taking the Long Way. As of July 2010, with 30.5 million certified albums,[3] and sales of 26,733,000 albums in the U.S., they have become the top selling all-female band in the U.S. during the Nielsen SoundScan era.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank Heaven's For Dale Evans  1990\n\n\n\nThank Heavens for Dale Evans is the debut album by American country band the Dixie Chicks. The group's original membership of Robin Lynn Macy, Laura Lynch, Martie Erwin, and Emily Erwin (whose married names changed to Martie Maguire and Emily Robison), would survive intact for only this album and the following Little Ol' Cowgirl, from 1989 to 1992, before first Macy, and then Lynch departed and the current vocalist, Natalie Maines assumed the vocalist position in 1995, creating the trio that became the highly successful band which found great fame in 1998 and remain popular with a large following to this day.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Cowboy Lives Forever&quot; (L.

As with their previous album, it produced no chart singles. It was also the last album to feature Robin Lynn Macy, who left in late 1992 over a dispute with the Erwin sisters over the musical direction of the band. The song &quot;Past the Point of Rescue&quot; was also recorded by Hal Ketchum on his 1991 album Past the Point of Rescue, from which it was released as a single in 1992.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Little Ol' Cowgirl&quot; (Jon Ims) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n2.\t&quot;A Road Is Just a Road&quot; (Mary Chapin Carpenter, John Jennings) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n3.\t&quot;She'll Find Better Things to Do&quot; (Bob Millard) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- 3:00\n4.\t&quot;Irish Medley&quot; (traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n5.\t&quot;You Send Me&quot; (Sam Cooke) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51\n6.\t&quot;Just a Bit Like Me&quot; (Robin Macy) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n7.\t&quot;A Heart That Can&quot; (Patti Dixon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:35\n8.\t&quot;Past the Point of Rescue&quot; (Mick Hanly) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n9.\t&quot;Beatin' Around the Bush&quot; (Matthew Benjamin, Martie Erwin) (Instrumental) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:32\n10.\t&quot;Two of a Kind&quot; (Ims) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n11.\t&quot;Standin' by the Bedside&quot; (Ira Tucker) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:29\n12.\t&quot;Aunt Mattie's Quilt&quot; (Lisa Brandenburg, Macy) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n13.\t&quot;Hallelujah, I Love Him So&quot; (Ray Charles) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:41\n14.\t&quot;Pink Toenails&quot; (Erwin, Laura Lynch) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShouldn't A Told You That 1993\n\n\n\nShouldn't a Told You That is the third album by American country band Dixie Chicks, released in 1993 (see 1993 in music).

It was their first record with new lead vocalist Natalie Maines, and became their breakthrough commercial success. It received diamond status by the RIAA on February 20, 2003 in the United States, having shipped 12 million units,[2] while spending more than six years in the Australian ARIA music charts Country Top 20. The album has sold 8,655,000 copies in the United States up to November 2008.[3]\n\nAt the 41st Grammy Awards, the album was awarded 2 Grammy Awards out of 3 nominations.[4] It was awarded Best Country Album (the first of what would be 4 trophies in this category: they would later win for Fly in 2001, Home in 2003, and Taking the Long Way in 2007.) and for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for the song There's Your Trouble. (an award the Chicks would win 5 times: in 2000 for Ready to Run, in 2003 for Long Time Gone, in 2005 for Top of the World and 2007 for Not Ready to Make Nice, a feat only matched by The Judds.)

It is notable for its acoustic bluegrass sound, which stands in contrast with their previous two country pop albums.\n\nThe group was promoting the album when lead singer Natalie Maines made controversial comments about U.S. President George W. Bush. The album's third single, &quot;Travelin' Soldier&quot;, was #1 on the Billboard Country Chart the week that Maines' comments hit the press.[2] The following week, as many stations started a still-standing boycott of the Chicks' music, the song collapsed. None of their following singles gained traction with country radio.\n\nDespite these events, the album was certified 6ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ Multi-platinum status by the RIAA and has sold 5,979,000 copies in the United States up to November 2008.[3] The album also featured a cover of Fleetwood Mac's &quot;Landslide&quot;, which was their biggest pop crossover hit until 2007, when &quot;Not Ready to Make Nice&quot; peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe album was also successful in Australia, in its 175th week in the country charts it was certified Triple Platinum for shipments of 210,000 copies.[4]\n\nThe album was nominated at the 45th Grammy Awards for 6 awards, including their second attempt for Album of the Year. The group went home with 4 in 2003, including Best Country Album, Best Recording Package, Best Country Instrumental Performance for &quot;Lil' Jack Slade&quot;, and Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for &quot;Long Time Gone&quot;. Additionally, they were nominated for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical and Darrell Scott was nominated for Best Country Song for Long Time Gone. Two years later, they were nominated and won Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, this time for &quot;Top of the World&quot;.\n\nIt debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart and stayed there for 4 non-consecutive weeks.

The album debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200 chart, initially selling 61,000 copies.
