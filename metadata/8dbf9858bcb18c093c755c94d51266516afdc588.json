I also labeled the files so that they automatically play in your portable player in the right order\n\nI reviewed the files thoroughly, but please let me know of any mistakes\n\n-- I hope you will find this as useful and enjoying as I did.\n\nP.S\nI recently published a .m4b version of &quot;Universe In a Nutshell&quot; which is automatically interpreted as an audiobook by ipods. However now I've realized that you DON'T have to convert to .m4b your .mp3 files to make them go to the audiobook section of your ipod, all you have to do is open itunes, select the files you wish to label as audiobooks, right click and select get info/then options, and in &quot;media kind&quot; select audiobook. This will automatically take them to the audiobook section and they wont play with your music when you shuffle it.\n\nenjoy,\nRegards\nEmscilem","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dbf9858bcb18c093c755c94d51266516afdc588","amp;dn":"A+Brief+History+of+Time+Chaptered+%26+Organized","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dbf9858bcb18c093c755c94d51266516afdc588","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,191,152,88,188,177,140,9,60,117,92,148,213,18,102,81,106,253,197,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
