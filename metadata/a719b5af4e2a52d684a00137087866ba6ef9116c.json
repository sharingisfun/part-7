It was a time of celebrated locomotives and luxurious passenger service, a time when rail technology saw its greatest advances and railroads became the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favored mode of transportation. These glory years come alive in American Passenger Trains and Locomotives Illustrated, 1889Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1971. For this volume, author and illustrator Mark Wegman has researched original railroad drawings and in some cases even paint chips to render more than 160 profiles, front and top views, and interior layouts depicting the steam, diesel, and electric locomotives, along with passenger cars, of three dozen of the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most celebrated trains of the golden age. Accompanying the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drawings are histories of each train, period photographs, postcards, menus, luggage stickers, vintage print ads, and detailed captions. The book is a lavishly appointed journey back in time to the bygone heyday of passenger-train travel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a719b5af4e2a52d684a00137087866ba6ef9116c","amp;dn":"American+Passenger+Trains+and+Locomotives+%28US+Railways+History%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a719b5af4e2a52d684a00137087866ba6ef9116c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,25,181,175,78,42,82,214,132,160,1,55,8,120,102,186,110,249,17,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
