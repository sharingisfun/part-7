It was first released on their 1972 album Machine Head. In 2004, the song was ranked number 434 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time, ranked number 4 in Total Guitar magazine's Greatest Guitar Riffs Ever, and in March 2005, Q magazine placed &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; at number 12 in its list of the 100 greatest guitar tracks.\n\nThe lyrics of the song tell a true story: on 4 December 1971 Deep Purple were in Montreux, Switzerland, where they had set up camp to record an album using a mobile recording studio (rented from the Rolling Stones and known as the Rolling Stones Mobile StudioÃ¢â‚¬â€referred to as the &quot;Rolling truck Stones thing&quot; and &quot;a mobile&quot; in the song lyrics) at the entertainment complex that was part of the Montreux Casino (referred to as &quot;the gambling house&quot; in the song lyric). On the eve of the recording session a Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention concert was held in the casino's theatre. In the middle of Don Preston's synthesizer solo on &quot;King Kong&quot;, the place suddenly caught fire when somebody in the audience fired a flare gun into the rattan covered ceiling, as mentioned in the &quot;some stupid with a flare gun&quot; line. The resulting fire destroyed the entire casino complex, along with all the Mothers' equipment. The &quot;smoke on the water&quot; that became the title of the song (credited to bass guitarist Roger Glover, who related how the title occurred to him when he suddenly woke from a dream a few days later) referred to the smoke from the fire spreading over Lake Geneva from the burning casino as the members of Deep Purple watched the fire from their hotel. The &quot;Funky Claude&quot; running in and out is referring to Claude Nobs, the director of the Montreux Jazz Festival who helped some of the audience escape the fire.\n\nLeft with an expensive mobile recording unit and no place to record, the band was forced to scout the town for another place to set up. One promising venue (found by Nobs) was a local theatre called The Pavilion, but soon after the band had loaded in and started working/recording, the nearby neighbours took offence at the noise, and the band was only able to lay down backing tracks for one song (based on Blackmore's riff and temporarily named &quot;Title nÃ‚Â°1&quot;), before the local police shut them down.\n\nFinally, after about a week of searching, the band rented the nearly-empty Montreux Grand Hotel and converted its hallways and stairwells into a makeshift recording studio, where they laid down most of the tracks for what would become their most commercially successful album, Machine Head (which is dedicated to Claude Nobs).\n\nThe only song from Machine Head not recorded entirely in the Grand Hotel was &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; itself, which had been partly recorded during the abortive Pavilion session. The lyrics of &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; were composed later, and the vocals were recorded in the Grand Hotel.\n\n\nDeep Purple are an English rock band formed in Hertford in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although their musical approach changed over the years. Originally formed as a progressive rock band, the band shifted its sound to hard rock in 1970, and in 2013 began exploring progressive metal. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the &quot;unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-Seventies&quot;. They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as &quot;the globe's loudest band&quot; for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre, and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide, including 8.5 million certified units in the US.\n(video does not have any logos and is extracted untouched)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_on_the_Water&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_on_the_Water&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iAcbfaage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iAcbfaage&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video  : MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 6000kbps\n   Audio 1: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 2304kbps [DVD, 24 bits]\n   Audio 2: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Duration: 00:06:04\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
