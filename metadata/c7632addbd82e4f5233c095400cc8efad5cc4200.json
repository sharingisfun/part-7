The LGV MÃ©diterranÃ©e extends from the end of the LGV RhÃ´ne-Alpes in Valence and terminates at Marseille via Avignon and Aix-en-Provence. \r\nOpened in 2001, the LGV MÃ©diterranÃ©e is operated by SNCFÂ® with TGV Duplex high speed trains, operating on the 25kV AC catenary system, capable of reaching 320 km/h. These revolutionary high speed trains slashed journey times to the South coast of France with TGVs now handling the vast majority of all journeys in France, covering some 750 km (470 miles) in around 3 hours â€“ faster than some domestic airlines. \r\n\r\nThe line serves a total of 4 stations, featuring three purpose-built structures, the Gare de Valence TGV, a uniquely built multi-level station allowing easy transfer between the high speed and local services, Gare dâ€™Avignon TGV, made popular by its close proximity to Avignon city centre and Gare d'Aix-en-Provence TGV, allowing easy travel into the north of Marseille and Marseille Airport, accessible by regular bus services. The final station is Marseille-Saint-Charles - a terminus station previously built to serve the surrounding area and the French Riviera, access to this station is via the classic French main lines. \r\n\r\nDue to the undulating nature of Southern Franceâ€™s terrain, the LGV MÃ©diterranÃ©e features many steep inclines and declines, not to mention the impressive number of vast cuttings, tunnels and viaducts that traverse the landscape, the longest tunnel being over 8 km (5 Miles) long. Not only is the outstanding scenery a wonder to behold, the LGV Med. regularly sees 300 â€“ 320 km/h operation providing a fast, reliable service with the beautiful southern France countryside flying past the upper and lower windows. \r\n\r\nThe route is equipped with the TVM430 (Transmission Voie-Machine) signalling system, a revolutionary in-cab signalling system designed for operating high speed trains in high capacity. Conventional signalling is not practical for very high speed routes, as drivers have very little time to see and react to what flies past the windscreen. TVM430 displays information in the cab telling the driver what speed he should be travelling at, without the need for conventional track-side equipment. \r\nIncluded with the 100km Marseille to Avignon high speed route is the iconic TGV Duplex in SNCF livery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS ADDON WILL NOT WORK ON LEGIT TRAIN SIMUALTOR 2016!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7632addbd82e4f5233c095400cc8efad5cc4200","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2016+DTG+LGV%3A+Marseille+-+Avignon+Route+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7632addbd82e4f5233c095400cc8efad5cc4200","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,99,42,221,189,130,228,245,35,60,9,84,0,204,142,250,213,204,66,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
