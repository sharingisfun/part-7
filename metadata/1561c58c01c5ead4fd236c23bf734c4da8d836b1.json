This book enables readers to perform more effectively, to understand project planning and control procedures and to gain an insight into the associated skills. Numerous case examples from diverse industries and exercises support and illustrate important concepts. The result is a new perspective for project managers: planning can be shown to be a systems synthesis or an inverse problem, and this provides a way to reach a satisfactory solution, avoiding the time-consuming or impractical search for the optimal solution.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1561c58c01c5ead4fd236c23bf734c4da8d836b1","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2006%5D+Project+Planning+and+Control","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1561c58c01c5ead4fd236c23bf734c4da8d836b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,97,197,140,1,197,234,212,253,35,108,35,191,115,76,77,168,216,54,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
