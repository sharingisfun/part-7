It uncovers how the brain becomes addicted and how it can be 'unaddicted' through a combination of diet, supplements and lifestyle factors. The book is written in association with Dr David Miller, who has worked in the addiction field for 25 years and is an expert in relapse prevention. \n\n It looks at each of the most common substances that people become addicted to and offers specific advice on how to tackle that particular substance safely and effectively yourself. In-depth yet practical and accessible, HOW TO QUIT WITHOUT FEELING S**T, will allow you to understand why you feel the way you do, whether you have a dependency or have already given up but still feel lousy. The book provides a 12-week action plan for becoming addiction free - without suffering the deeply unpleasant symptoms of withdrawal that most addicts believe they must go through\n\n\n\n[img]http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Po9Avtd8L._SS500_.jpg[/img]\n\nHow to Quit Without Feeling S**T \n\nPublisher: Hachette Digital\nPatrick Holford\nEnglish\n2008 \nISBN-10: 0749909943\nISBN-13: 978-0749909949\n512 pages \nPDF ,EPUB , MOBI \n6.53 MB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbdbce1b962ec7f8257716ad31691489c8d5d3e0","amp;dn":"How+To+Quit+Without+Feeling+S%2A%2AT+%28Audio+Book+%2B+Pdf%2CEpub%2CMobi%29+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbdbce1b962ec7f8257716ad31691489c8d5d3e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,219,206,27,150,46,199,248,37,119,22,173,49,105,20,137,200,213,211,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
