Connections were solid over Wi-Fi (could not test 3G properly because I don't get the best signal from home). The user interface and the way it handles the mouse cursor &amp; custom keys is my favorite as well. Not to mention that this app covers both RDP + VNC, and is such a reasonable price for what it does!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Nick\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis app is awesome. Ridiculously easy to set up. The pointer they came up with is great and it runs flawlessly on my EVO.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Andre\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEasy to set up and use.
