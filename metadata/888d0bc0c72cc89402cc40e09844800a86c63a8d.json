He was highly respected by his fellow countrymen, as well as by foreign seekers. His legacy is immense. He is always about real yoga, and not just asanas. He is like the trunk of a tree -- his major disciples are like the big boughs -- and from them branch out countless more teachers and practitioners.\n\nHere are collected all of the works directly written by Swami Sivananda. They are freely available at the website of his ashram. I have just collected them in one place and given them better filenames. Go there and get them if you're concerned about your torrent ratio. ;)\n\nThere are many more books available from his other disciples, notably Krishnananda, Chidananda, etc... they are also freely available and worthwhile. I will be making a torrent with much of that material soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:888d0bc0c72cc89402cc40e09844800a86c63a8d","amp;dn":"Swami+Sivananda+%2848+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"888d0bc0c72cc89402cc40e09844800a86c63a8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,141,11,192,199,44,200,148,2,204,64,224,152,68,128,10,134,198,58,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
