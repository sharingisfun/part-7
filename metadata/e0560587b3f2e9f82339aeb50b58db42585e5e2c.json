Here he uses Illustrator and Photoshop to create a type treatment inspired by GrungeÃ¢â‚¬â€the style most commonly associated with the music scene that originated in Seattle in the 1980s and 90s, and continues to resonate today. Learn how to create a background &quot;wall&quot; of type using Illustrator symbols, delete the counter spaces, and distress the design with dirty type.\n\nLooking for more Type Projects?
