With RaphaelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark wit and flair, Founding Myths exposed the errors and inventions in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most cherished tales, from Paul RevereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famous ride to Patrick HenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Liberty or DeathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ speech. For the thousands who have been captivated by RaphaelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye-opening accounts, history has never been the same.\n\nIn this revised tenth-anniversary edition, Raphael revisits the original myths and further explores their evolution over time, uncovering new stories and peeling back new layers of misinformation. This new edition also examines the highly politicized debates over AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past, as well as how our approach to history in school reinforces rather than corrects historical mistakes.\n\nA book that Ã¢â‚¬Å“explores the truth behind the stories of the making of our nationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (National Public Radio), this revised edition of Founding Myths will be a welcome resource for anyone seeking to separate historical fact from fiction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5eedea8332861ebefb9334d57cdff6baf30ce4a","amp;dn":"Founding+Myths%2C+10th+Ann+Ed.-+Ray+Raphael+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5eedea8332861ebefb9334d57cdff6baf30ce4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,238,222,168,51,40,97,235,239,185,51,77,87,205,255,107,175,48,206,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
