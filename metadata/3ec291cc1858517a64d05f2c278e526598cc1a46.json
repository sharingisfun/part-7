The book was released on June 19, 2011, as a sequel to The Bourne Objective.\n\nJason Bourne is searching for an elusive cadre of terrorists planning to destroy America's most strategic natural resources-and needs the help of his longtime friend, General Boris Karpov. Karpov, the newly appointed head of Russia's most feared spy agency, FSB-2, is one of the most determined, honorable, and justice-hungry men that Bourne knows. But Karpov has made a deal with the devil. In order to remain the head of FSB-2, he must hunt down and kill Bourne. Now, these two trusted friends are on a deadly collision course. From the Colombian highlands to Munich, Cadiz, and Damascus, the clock is counting down to a disaster that will cripple America's economic and military future. Only Bourne and Karpov have a chance to avert the catastrophe-but if they destroy each other first, that chance will be gone forever.\n\nDownloaded from mobilism.org (Credits to original uploader) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.mobilism.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=217352&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.mobilism.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=217352&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ec291cc1858517a64d05f2c278e526598cc1a46","amp;dn":"Robert+Ludlum+-+Bourne+09+-+The+Bourne+Dominion+%5BEPUB%2FMOBI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ec291cc1858517a64d05f2c278e526598cc1a46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,194,145,204,24,88,81,122,100,208,95,44,39,142,82,101,152,204,26,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
