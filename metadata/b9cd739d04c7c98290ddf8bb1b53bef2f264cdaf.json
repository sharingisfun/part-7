The tension among bandmembers is evident on the advanced versions of &quot;One Down, One Up&quot; and &quot;My Favorite Things.&quot; Coltrane's performance is movingâ€¦yet weary. It's apparent the saxophonist wasn't getting the sound he wanted and by the end of the year he would take a different direction, hiring Pharoah Sanders and wife Alice Coltrane for the band. Tenor saxophonist Archie Shepp's earlier afternoon New Thing performance includes engaging versions of &quot;Call Me by My Rightful Name&quot; with Bobby Hutcherson on vibes.\r\n\r\nThe jazz world was immersed in controversy in 1965 when the bands of John Coltrane and Archie Shepp appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival. Coltrane's own style was undergoing constant evolution, his lines more convoluted and explosive, his sound increasingly ranging to vocal cries and metallic abrasions. He had also become a figurehead of the &quot;avant-garde&quot; or &quot;New Thing,&quot; an established star who provided a public forum for younger musicians and the creative ferment largely taking place out of public hearing.\r\n\r\n&quot;One Up, One Down,&quot; an intensely propulsive tenor performance, is emblematic of Coltrane's emphasis on shorter phrases and a concentrated expressionism. Shepp's set catches him at a creative peak, a gifted tenor saxophonist whose solos could invoke the breathy lyricism of Ben Webster or meld free-jazz exploration with some pointed rhythm &amp; blues. He's joined by a brilliant band, vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson and bassist Barre Phillips complementing Shepp's passion with airy virtuosity and drummer Joe Chambers providing an elastic beat for the leader's creative rhythmic detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecorded July 2, 1965 at the Newport Jazz Festival.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Introduction (Father Norman O'Connor)\r\n02 - One Down, One Up*\r\n03 - Rufus (Swung His Face At Last To The Wind, Then His Neck Snapped)\r\n04 - Le Matin Des Noire\r\n05 - Scag\r\n06 - Call Me By My Rightful Name\r\n\r\n*2009 Impulse! / Verve | 0602517920392\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nJohn Coltrane - tenor saxophone*\r\nMcCoy Tyner - piano*\r\nJimmy Garrison - bass*\r\nElvin Jones - drums*\r\n\r\nArchie Shepp - tenor saxophone\r\nBobby Hutcherson - vibes\r\nBarre Phillips - bass\r\nJoe Chambers - drums\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Coltrane - The John Coltrane Quartet Plays (1965) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/13848122/_John_Coltrane_-_The_John_Coltrane_Quartet_Plays_%281965%29_%5BEAC-FLA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Coltrane - A Love Supreme (1964) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n  \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/13541263/John_Coltrane_-_A_Love_Supreme_%281964%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Coltrane Quartet - Crescent (1964) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n  \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/13526772/John_Coltrane_Quartet_-_Crescent_%281964%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9cd739d04c7c98290ddf8bb1b53bef2f264cdaf","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+%26amp%3B+Archie+Shepp+-+New+Thing+At+Newport+%281965%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9cd739d04c7c98290ddf8bb1b53bef2f264cdaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,205,115,157,4,199,201,130,144,221,248,187,27,83,190,242,242,100,205,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
