In a world where economies as diverse as Ireland, Singapore and Dubai have tried to re-create the &quot;Israel effect&quot;, there are entrepreneurial lessons well worth noting. As America reboots its own economy and can-do spirit, there's never been a better time to look at this remarkable and resilient nation for some impressive, surprising clues.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81e770f59d80ed4e448bf1372fdc0c23c77e39c8","amp;dn":"Start+Up+Nation+-+The+Story+of+Israel%27s+Economic+Miracle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81e770f59d80ed4e448bf1372fdc0c23c77e39c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,231,112,245,157,128,237,78,68,139,241,55,47,220,12,35,199,126,57,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
