Says theÂ Los Angeles Times, â€œKronos conceives the work as a never-slackening exercise in fiery, forthright emotionalism and dramatic intensity.â€\r\n\r\nWondering Sound:\r\nTightly wound and surpremely controlled\r\n&quot;From time to time, the Kronos Quartet has released a one-piece recording, which allows the group to retreat to the sylvan tranquility of Skywalker Studios in the hills near San Francisco and immerse itself in one composerâ€™s expressive world. Wijtold Lutoslawskiâ€™s only string quartet dates from 1964, when the Polish composer was exploring ways for a creative artist to relinquish control over the products of his imagination and turn it over to the performers. That, it turns out, is not an easy thing to do. Classical musicians are trained to interpret instructions, and the clearer and more detailed a score is, the more comfortable they are. â€œPlay it your wayâ€ is a difficult order to follow. Accordingly, composers have resorted to various tricks to get players to take over part of the responsibility for a how a piece sounds. Lutoslawski initially wrote out the four parts of the quartet separately and refused to provide a complete score so that the musicians wouldnâ€™t be tempted to slide into synch. Later, he relented and came up with an elaborate system of notation intended to coax reluctant musicians into a limited degree of improvisation. The result, paradoxically, is a piece that sounds tightly wound and supremely controlled, a dark, sepulchral work buzzing with dissonance and bristling with choreographed expressions of Atomic-Age angst.&quot; --Justin Davidson\r\n\r\n1.
