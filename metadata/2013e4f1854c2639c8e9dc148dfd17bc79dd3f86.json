I Can't Quit You\r\n2. Dazed and Confused\r\n3. You Shook Me\r\n4. How Many More Times\r\n5. Communication Breakdown\r\n\r\nHistorical note: This is the earliest known live soundboard recording.\r\n\r\nComments: This is all that is known to exist of this show, and it is a shame ... \r\nthis is great one! Robert is hoarse with a sore throat but his singing is still \r\ngutsy and the band is unreal, especially on Dazed And Confused. The group \r\nexperienced some of equipment problems which caused the long delays between \r\nthe songs so Robert leading to request the audience, &quot;Has anybody got a Les \r\nPaul? Jeff who? Tell him to bring it here then!&quot; As the band took the stage \r\nfor the encore, Plant saying &quot;I tell you what! This is the third night and \r\nwe've decided that we're gonna come and live here, 'cos you're so nice! If \r\nwe don't make it, then the police in England would rather we'd stay there!&quot; \r\nCommunication Breakdown has Plant substituting his &quot;banshee-scream&quot; before \r\nthe solo with a lion's growl. This is also the earliest known live soundboard \r\nrecording of Led Zeppelin and it's typical of the era, with the vocals and \r\ndrums to the fore","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2013e4f1854c2639c8e9dc148dfd17bc79dd3f86","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1969.01.11+San+Francisco%2C+Fillmore+West+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2013e4f1854c2639c8e9dc148dfd17bc79dd3f86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,19,228,241,133,76,38,57,200,233,220,20,141,253,23,188,121,221,63,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
