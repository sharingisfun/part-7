Teaming up once again with producer Chris Kimsey, Clutching at Straws showcases some of the band's most satisfying compositions, including the magnificent &quot;Warm Wet Circles&quot; and &quot;That Time of the Night (The Short Straw)&quot;. Bookended by Fish's disgust with not only himself, &quot;Torch Song&quot;, but also with the burgeoning neo-nazi uprising in Europe, &quot;White Russian&quot;, the great Scot delivers an inspired condemnation. The commercial pomp and circumstance of &quot;Incommunicado&quot; also gives way to a self-parodying confessional inspired by Fish's inability to see himself as a bona fide rock star and celebrity (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI want to do adverts for American Express cards, talk shows on prime time T.V.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). Tour opener &quot;Slainte Mhath&quot; is simple and elegant, building to its dramatic crescendo only to be upstaged by &quot;Sugar Mice&quot; -- quite simply, one of Marillion's best commercial singles ever. The album's stunning closer, &quot;The Last Straw&quot;, is Fish's self-realization that yes, the band is not only over, but that in his mind, its null and void (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œand if you ever come across us, don't give us your sympathyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). Steven Rothery's blinding guitar solo brings the whole thing down to a crashing finish (prophetically, announcing his arrival as the band's true musical instigator on subsequent Fish-less records).\n\nThe 1999 re-release of Clutching at Straws features a bonus disc chock full of unreleased material (seven tracks in all) that the band half-heartedly demoed following the Straws tour. The songs were to serve as the album's follow-up; unfortunately, it was never released -- until now. Upon closer inspection, Marillion fanatics will recognize &quot;Beaujolais Day&quot; (later renamed &quot;Seasons End&quot;) and &quot;Story From a Thin Wall&quot; (the lyrics would become Fish's &quot;Family Business.&quot; The music from that same song would later be revisited and used as the bed for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBerlinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), which would show up on Season's End. Other interesting anomalies include &quot;Sunset Hill&quot;, as well as demo versions of &quot;White Russians&quot; and the original two-track demo for &quot;Sugar Mice in the Rain&quot;.\n\nTracklist:\nDisc 1:\n01.
