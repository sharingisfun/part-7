Beginning with a rare-ish Salsoul Orchestra/Loleatta Holloway collaboration (&quot;Seconds&quot;), My Salsoul skips quite a few of the label's highlights to focus on tracks from obscurists like Rafael Cameron, Carol Williams, and Skyy (the latter's &quot;Here's to You&quot; is present in a Dimitri From Paris remix). Most of the rare songs aren't worth hearing -- major exception: the intense Walter Gibbons remix of Holloway's &quot;Catch Me on the Rebound&quot; -- and though Dimitri does spin a pair of acknowledged classics (&quot;Ten Percent&quot; by Double Exposure and &quot;Let No Man Put Asunder&quot; by First Choice; toward the end, natch), he also turns in the most ephemeral entry in the label's entire catalog: Charo's horridly tacky &quot;Love Boat Theme.&quot; My Salsoul never fails to evoke the disco era, for better and for worse -- fans of the sound who haven't heard the vintage Salsoul mix Disco Boogie, Vol. 1 will want to proceed there first.\n\n----------Track listing----------\n\n01 - Seconds\n02 - Moment of My Life\n03 - Love Sensation [Alternate Take]\n04 - (Knock Out) Let's Go Another Round\n05 - Here's to You [Dim's Body &amp; Soul Re-Edit][Edit]\n06 - Boogie's Gonna Get Ya'\n07 - Sadie (She Smokes)\n08 - Ooh I Love It (Love Break)\n09 - Love Is You\n10 - Love Boat Theme\n11 - Salsoul Rainbow [Dim's Dance Floor Re-Edit]\n12 - Catch Me on the Rebound [W.
