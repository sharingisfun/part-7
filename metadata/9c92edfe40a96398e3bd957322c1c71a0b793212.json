It was released on February 6, 2003, by Aftermath Entertainment, under a joint venture with Shady Records, and distributed by Interscope Records. Its initially planned release was pushed seven days ahead due to heavy bootlegging and Internet leakage. The album featured production from Dr. Dre and Eminem, and featured guest appearances from Eminem and then-newcomers Young Buck, Lloyd Banks, and Tony Yayo of the group G-Unit.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 872,000 copies in its first week.[4] It spawned four singles, including the number 1-hits &quot;In da Club&quot; and &quot;21 Questions&quot;, and the international single &quot;P.I.M.P.&quot; By December 2003, Get Rich or Die TryinÃ¢â‚¬Å 'Ã¢â‚¬â€¹ has sold 8.1 million copies in the United States and was certified 6 times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.[5] Upon its release, the album received positive reviews from most music critics and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, losing to OutKast's Speakerboxxx/The Love Below at the 46th Grammy Awards. It ranked Number 37 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of best albums of the 2000s.\n\n\nNo.\tTitle\tWriter(s)\tProducer(s)\tLength\t\n1.\t&quot;Intro&quot;  \t \t \t0:06\n2.\t&quot;What Up Gangsta&quot;  \tCurtis Jackson, Rob Tewlow\tRob &quot;Reef&quot; Tewlow\t2:59\n3.\t&quot;Patiently Waiting&quot; (featuring Eminem)\tJackson, Marshall Mathers, Luis Resto, Mike Elizondo\tEminem\t4:48\n4.\t&quot;Many Men (Wish Death)&quot;  \tJackson, Darrell Branch, Resto\tDarrell &quot;Digga&quot; Branch, Eminem (add.), Luis Resto (add.)\t4:16\n5.\t&quot;In da Club&quot;  \tJackson, Andre Young, Elizondo\tDr. Dre, Elizondo (co.)\t3:13\n6.\t&quot;High All the Time&quot;  \tJackson, Mathers, Michael Clervoix, Conrad Almonacy, Resto\tDJ Rad, Eminem (co.), Sha Money XL (co.)\t4:29\n7.\t&quot;Heat&quot;  \tJackson, Young, Tommy Coster, Elizondo\tDr. Dre\t4:14\n8.\t&quot;If I Can't&quot;  \tJackson, Young, Elizondo\tDr. Dre, Elizondo (co.)\t3:16\n9.\t&quot;Blood Hound&quot; (featuring Young Buck of G-Unit)\tJackson, Sean Henderson, David Brown\tSean Blaze\t4:00\n10.\t&quot;Back Down&quot;  \tJackson, Young, Ron Feemster, Elizondo\tDr. Dre\t4:03\n11.\t&quot;P.I.M.P.&quot;  \tJackson, Denaun Porter\tDenaun Porter\t4:09\n12.\t&quot;Like My Style&quot; (featuring Tony Yayo of G-Unit)\tJackson, Marvin Bernard, Dana Stinson\tRockwilder\t3:13\n13.\t&quot;Poor Lil Rich&quot;  \tJackson, Clervoix\tSha Money XL, Eminem (add.)\t3:19\n14.\t&quot;21 Questions&quot; (featuring Nate Dogg)\tJackson, Kevin Risto\tDirty Swif\t3:44\n15.\t&quot;Don't Push Me&quot; (featuring Lloyd Banks of G-Unit &amp; Eminem)\tJackson, Mathers, Christopher Lloyd, Resto\tEminem\t4:08\n16.\t&quot;Gotta Make It to Heaven&quot;  \tJackson, Dorsey Wesley\tMegahertz\t4:01\n17.\t&quot;Wanksta&quot; (bonus track)\tJackson, John Freeman, Clervoix\tJohn &quot;J-Praize&quot; Freeman\t3:39\n18.\t&quot;U Not like Me&quot; (bonus track)\tJackson, Andy Thelusma\tRed Spyda\t4:15\n19.\t&quot;Life's on the Line&quot; (bonus track)\tJackson, Terence Dudley\tTerence Dudley\t3:38","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c92edfe40a96398e3bd957322c1c71a0b793212","amp;dn":"50+Cent+-+Get+Rich+or+Die+Tryin%27+%282003%29+-+%28CDrip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c92edfe40a96398e3bd957322c1c71a0b793212","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,146,237,254,64,169,99,152,227,189,149,115,34,193,199,26,11,121,50,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
