The goal of those who control the system, in QuigleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own words, is to dominate Ã¢â‚¬Å“all habitable portions of the world.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Using deception, theft, and violence, they have achieved more toward this goal than any rulers in human history.\nHowever, the Information Age is quickly derailing their plans. The immorality of their system, and those who serve it, has become nearly impossible to hide. Awareness and resistance are growingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Tragedy is yielding to hope. \n\n\nAbout the author:\nIn 2003, Joseph Plummer sold his successful Internet-based business and, using the proceeds, embarked on a ten-year, not-for-profit path. His goal: expose the appalling deception and crimes of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ruling elite. Now, ten years later, Tragedy and Hope 101 represents the culmination of his efforts. Based on the groundbreaking research of Carroll Quigley, Tragedy and Hope 101 condenses QuigleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s startling revelations into just a couple hundred pages. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever suspected that Ã¢â‚¬Å“democratic governmentsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“free marketsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ can be secretly manipulated and controlled, this book is for you. It will not only confirm your suspicions, it will show you how itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done. However, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve accepted the schoolhouse version of Western democracy, the meticulously footnoted facts presented in this book are sure to turn your worldview upside down.
