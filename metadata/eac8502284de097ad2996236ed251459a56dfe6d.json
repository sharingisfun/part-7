Renewable Energy Systems: Advanced Conversion Technologies and Applications describes advanced conversion technologies and provides design examples of converters and inverters for renewable energy systemsÃ¢â‚¬â€including wind turbine and solar panel energy systems.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLearn Cutting-Edge Techniques for Converters and Inverters\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSetting the scene, the book begins with a review of the basics of astronomy and Earth physics. It then systematically introduces more than 200 topologies of advanced converters originally developed by the authors, including 150 updated circuits on modern conversion technologies. It also discusses recently published topologies and thoroughly analyzes new converter circuits. Novel approaches include split-capacitor and split-inductor techniques that can be applied in super-lift and other converters.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nResolve Historic Problems in Conversion Technologies\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlong with offering many cutting-edge techniques, the authors resolve some historic problems, such as the accurate determination of the conduction angle of single-phase rectifiers and power factor correction. They also describe a new seriesÃ¢â‚¬â€laddered multilevel invertersÃ¢â‚¬â€that uses few devices to produce more levels, overcoming the drawbacks of the pulse-width-modulation (PWM) inverter and providing great scope for industrial applications.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTap the Knowledge of Pioneers in the Field\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis book is written by pioneers in advanced conversion technology who have created a large number of converters, including the world-renowned DC/DC Luo-converters and super-lift Luo-converters. Featuring numerous examples and diagrams, it guides readers in designing advanced converters for use in renewable energy systems.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eac8502284de097ad2996236ed251459a56dfe6d","amp;dn":"Renewable+Energy+Systems+Advanced+Conversion+Technologies+and+Ap","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eac8502284de097ad2996236ed251459a56dfe6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,200,80,34,132,222,9,122,210,153,98,54,237,37,20,89,165,109,254,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
