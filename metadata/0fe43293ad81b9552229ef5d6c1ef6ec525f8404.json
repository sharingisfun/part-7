Happily, this volume offers novel approaches and outstandingly handsome illustrations, nearly half in color. Insightful commentary is arranged thematically and begins with the American twist given to Impressionism, a style essentially born and developed in France. Through essays on country, city, and home, the authors examine how the subject matter reflected the nature of American life and culture during that era. The catalog is to accompany a nationwide traveling exhibition. Appendixes include lists of works contained in and lenders to the exhibition, as well as biographies of the painters. Highly recommended for general as well as scholarly readers. - Kathleen Eagen Johnson, Historic Hudson Valley, Tarrytown, N.Y.
