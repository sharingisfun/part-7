Here's what the author has to say about his new book: &quot;&quot;Five Portraits&quot; is a kind of sequel to &quot;Board Stiff&quot; in that it picks up where the other leaves off, with the same characters. Apart from that, it's one of my favorites within the series. There's something about Astrid Basilisk that appeals to me: a very pretty girl whose very glance is deadly, yet she's a nice person whose selfless effort to save five difficult children from future Xanth is thoroughly worthy. I also like the theme of the power of unlikely friendship. Not just Xanth, but Mundania, too, would be better if there were more such friendships.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e045e929cb0a26eb896e1657e877d878aacfb9b","amp;dn":"%5BXanth+39%5D+Five+Portraits+by+Piers+Anthony+%28retail+epub%2C+mobi%29+%7B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e045e929cb0a26eb896e1657e877d878aacfb9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,4,94,146,156,176,162,110,184,150,225,101,126,135,125,135,138,172,251,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
