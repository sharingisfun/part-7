It was published in 2000.\n\nIn the book Jack Ryan is President of the United States. After Russia discovers oil fields the size of the Persian Gulf's in Siberia and gold deposits just as big, it looks as if the struggling Russian economy is on the road to recovery. But China decides to speed up its plan to invade Siberia, which had originally been delayed after the defeat of Japan in the book Debt of Honor.\n\n- - - - -\n\nPower is delightful, and absolute power should be absolutely delightfulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“but not when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re the most powerful man on earth and the place is ticking like a time bomb. Jack Ryan, CIA warrior turned U.S. president, is the man in the hot seat, and in this vast thriller heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s up to his nostrils in crazed Asian warlords, Russian thugs, nukes that wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stay put, and authentic, up-to-the-nanosecond technology as complex as the charactersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ motives are simple. Quick, do you know how to reprogram the software in an Aegis missile seekerhead? Well, if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Jack Ryan, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d better find someone who does, or an incoming ballistic may rain fallout on your parade. Bad for reelection prospects. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou know, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really like this job very much,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Ryan complains to his aide Arnie van Damm, who replies, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t supposed to be fun, Jack.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nBut you bet The Bear and the Dragon is funÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“over 1,000 swift pagesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ worth. In the opening scene, a hand-launched RPG rocket nearly blows up RussiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intelligence chief in his armored Mercedes, and RyanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clever spooks report that the guy who got the rocket in his face instead was the hoodlum ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRasputinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Avseyenko, who used to run the KGBÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSparrow SchoolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of female prostitute spies. Soon after, two apparent assassins are found handcuffed together afloat in St. PetersburgÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Neva River, their bloated faces resembling PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon toys.\n\nThe stakes go higher as the mystery deepens: oil and gold are discovered in huge quantities in Siberia, and the evil Chinese Minister Without Portfolio Zhang Han San gazes northward with lust. The laid-off elite of the Soviet Army figure in the brewing troubles, as do the new generation of Tiananmen Square dissidents, ZhangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wily, Danielle Steel-addicted executive secretary Lian Ming, and Chester Nomuri, a hip, Internet-porn-addicted CIA agent posing in China as a Japanese computer salesman. He e-mails his CIA boss, Mary Pat ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe CowgirlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Foley, that he intends to seduce Ming with Dream Angels perfume and scarlet VictoriaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Secret lingerie ordered from the catalogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“strictly for God and country, of course. Soon Ming is calling him ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMaster SausageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ instead of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œComrade,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but can anybody master Ming?\n\nThe plot is over the top, with devastating subplots erupting all over the globe and lurid characters scaring the wits out of each other every few pages, but Clancy finds time to insert hard-boiled little lessons on the vileness of Communism, the infuriating intrusions of the press on presidential power, the sexual perversions of Mao, the poor quality of Russian pistol silencers (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½garbage, cans loaded with steel wool that self-destructed after less than ten shotsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), the folly of cutting a manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s throat with a knife (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½they flop around and make noise when you do thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), and similar topics. Naturally, the book bristles like a battlefield with intriguingly intricate military hardwardware...)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7338851c642eb4df6cd71a65b879923c6c8fb398","amp;dn":"THE+BEAR+%26+THE+DRAGON+-+Tom+Clancy.+Frank+Muller+%28ABR%29+%7BFerraBit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7338851c642eb4df6cd71a65b879923c6c8fb398","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,56,133,28,100,46,180,223,108,215,26,101,184,121,146,60,108,143,179,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
