They have both been in the writing industry for over 30 years.\nMaddyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interest in fish began when she was five years old. She often dreamed of keeping fish at home as she watched the local fishermen bring in their daily catch in her hometown. She began keeping aquariums at age seven and began breeding fish at age ten. She built her aquarium collection by selling and trading her newborn fry to local aquarium stores in exchange for aquariums and equipment as she was growing up.\nHer passion for aquarium fish continued on after she finished her college degree in journalism and began writing aquarium-keeping articles for print and online aquatic magazines. Eventually, she wrote several aquarium columns and began writing fishkeeping books to help other hobbyists enjoy keeping aquariums at home as much as she did. Her love of fish has also appeared in her greeting cards, cartoons, and other artwork.\n\nMic has kept aquarium fish for almost 30 years. He was one of the first sailors to develop a tank system that could keep aquarium fish alive onboard Navy vessels. His love of fish began when he saw many different species, aquatic traditions, and other hobbyists while on his worldwide military travels.\nBoth authors enjoy breeding fish, traveling, scuba diving, cooking and creating exciting new recipes, collecting old records, and computer games.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 368 pages\n    * Publisher: For Dummies; 2 edition (September 25, 2006)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0470051035\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0470051030","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de4e3be06e125fea096b0f61248f147659bc8578","amp;dn":"Freshwater+Aquariums+For+Dummies%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de4e3be06e125fea096b0f61248f147659bc8578","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,78,59,224,110,18,95,234,9,107,15,97,36,143,20,118,89,188,133,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
