There&amp;#039;s no password.\nIf you don&amp;#039;t have any RAR upacker, you&amp;#039;ll have to download\none from somewhere.\n\n\nBelow are suggestions for using some free or semi-free\n(trial) sofware for unpacking RAR archives:\n\n\nRAR applications under Windows:\nZipeg\nUltimateZip\nStuffIt Expander  (free)\nStuffIt Deluxe    (30 days trial)\nStuffIt Standard  (30 days trial)\nWinRAR            (40 days evaluation)\n\n\nRAR applications under Mac OS X:\nUnRarX\nRAR Expander \nSimplyRAR\nThe Unarchiver \nStuffIt Expander  (free)\nStuffIt Deluxe    (30 days trial)\nStuffIt Standard  (30 days trial)\nRAR for Mac OS X  (40 days trial)\n\n\nRAR applications under Mac OS Classic:\nMacUnRAR\nStuffIt Expander\n\n\nWhat&amp;#039;s it for?\nThe Mac OS 9.0.4 ISO file is the &quot;mold&quot; for creating one or\nseveral instances of physical Mac OS 9.0.4 CDs. The physical\nCD can be used for booting up and installing the OS to many \nolder Macintosh computer models. Use your favourite burning\napplication or download one from the Internet. Please note\nthat you CANNOT use a rewritable CD for this if you want it\nto boot on most older Macintoshes! You do not need to burn\nthe ISO image on a Mac. The ISO standard describes a CD bit\nby bit and the burning system doesn&amp;#039;t need to &quot;understand&quot;\nwhat&amp;#039;s on the CD. Like a photocopier.\n\n\nHere below are some suggestions for free software to burn \nISO images on different platforms. Additionally, on Mac OS \nX and other Unix type OSes (Solaris, Irix, Linux, BSD, etc) \nthere&amp;#039;s normally some nifty command line solution that will \ndo the trick, but you&amp;#039;ll have to find out for yourself what \nthat might be on each particular platform.\n\n\nBurning applications for Windows:\nImgBurn\nISO Recorder \nBurnCDCC\nInfraRecorder\nDeepBurner\nUltimate CD/DVD Burner \nBurn At Once\nBurn Aware \n\n\nBurning applications for Mac OS X:\nMac OS X Disk Utility (included in the OS)\nBurn\nDiscribe 5.1.7 (demo version gives you 5 free burns)\nDisco (7 disk free burns)\n\n\nBurning applications for Mac OS 8.6 - 9.x.x:\nDiscribe 5.1.7 (demo version gives you 5 free burns)\nSame demo download as for Mac OS X.\n\n\n\nWhy?\nWhy not? Old operating systems can be (sort of) fun.\nAnd you need them to fire up old hardware.\n\n\nHow do I use the CD?\nOn a Macintosh you boot from CD by holding down the &quot;C&quot; key\non the keyboard. The Mac OS CD of course must be in the drive.\nThe Mac will also boot from the CD if there&amp;#039;s no system on \nthe hard disk. All Mac OS CDs are &quot;live&quot; CDs. A limited \nlive system booted from the CD will allow you to format a hard\ndrive and install a &quot;real&quot;, complete OS from it onto the hard\ndrive. \n\n\nIs it for my Macintosh model?\nGo to Apple&amp;#039;s URL and search for article number 25114.\nIt will present you with a table of Macintosh models and what\nversions of Mac OS support them. This software can&amp;#039;t be used\non Intel Macs or on PCs.\n\n\nWhat else?\nAn OS isn&amp;#039;t much fun by itself. The empty space of the original\nCD has been filled with an assortment of system upgrades\nand other software. The extra material is all placed into one\ndirectory named XTRAS, as to isolate it from the original contents\nof the CD. The files are further sorted by type into \nseparate folders. System updates are all in the System Updates\nfolder, etc. Programs that need serials or cracks have them in \nseparate text files in the same folder where the program resides. \n\nHere&amp;#039;s a list of the extra material:\n\nAcrobat Reader 5.05\nCD Everywhere 2.0\nToast 5.0.1\nNetscape 7.02\nFlash Player 7.0r69\nMacromedia Shockwave 10.1.1.016\nTransmit 1.7 FTP\nNetPresenz 4.1\nUSB Overdrive 1.4\niTunes 2.0.4\nMusic Vac\nQuickTime 6.0.3\nRealPlayer 8\nSoundApp 2.7.3\nAppleWorks 5.0.3\nStuffIt 7.0.3\nA-Dock 3.0.1\nDragThing 4.6.1\nKaleidoscope 2.3.1 \nAquamakeover (Jaguar theme for Kaleidoscope)\nJoliet Volume Access 2.0.3\nMarine Aquarium 1.1\nSwitchRes 2.5.3\nAirPort 2.0.2\nCarbonLib 1.6\nColorSync 3.0.3\nDisk First Aid 8.6.1\nJava 2.2.6\nMultiple Users 1.4.1\nOpenGL 1.2.1\nURL Access 2.3\nUSB Card Support 1.4.1\nGraphic Converter 5.9.5\nPCalc 2.2.2\nVueScan 7.6.64\n\n\nThe versions of the system upgrades are the latest supported \non Mac OS 9.0.4. Most application programs will require that \nCarbonLib 1.6 is installed beforehand. You can install everything\non the disk, but you should start with CarbonLib and the system\nupgrades. Updating QuckTime is essential.\n\nSome of these files, like the Aquamakeover Jaguar theme, can&amp;#039;t\nbe found on the Internet anymore. \n\nIf you don&amp;#039;t know what a program is about, google for it.\n\n\nWhat&amp;#039;s the use?\nOlder systems can still be useful for productive work. This ISO\ncontains pretty much everything a small home office could ask for.\nIt is a tribute to all dumpster divers and hardware hamsters out there.\nTo people who can&amp;#039;t let go.\n\n\nHow long will it be seeded?\nA very short time.\nYou guys will have to keep up the seed or reseed it at some other\ndate.\n\n\nWhat then?\nCheck out my &quot;Mac OS 9 Companion Disk&quot; torrent. It is a continuation\nof this disk, featuring Mac OS upgrades up to 9.2.2, more office \nsoftware, Photoshop 6 and more.\n\n\nHow can you help?\nPlease get in touch with me if you can help providing me with Mac OS \nClassic software. My wishlist is as follows:\n\nMac OS 9.1, retail, North American English\nMac OS 9.2.1, retail, North American English\n\nRetail means the disk isn&amp;#039;t specific to any particular Macintosh model.\nThe original disk has a yellow-orange-brownish number 9 on white \nbackground.\n\nOffice 2001, any Englih version and also the Swedish language version. \n\nAnything Adobe, except for Photoshop 6.\nMusic software.\n\nIn fact, pretty much everything is interesting, except for what you see\nlisted above and in my other torrents.\n\nIf you&amp;#039;re having problems downloading this torrent or any other torrent \nof mine, get in touch with me and we&amp;#039;ll try other solutions, like \nRapidshare etc.\n\nMy email adress is:  thickdick[at]bigfoot.com\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e5c4896a74c653f27b7e49336564c3103e76f6c","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+9.0.4+International+English%2C+retail+version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e5c4896a74c653f27b7e49336564c3103e76f6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,92,72,150,167,76,101,63,39,183,228,147,54,86,76,49,3,231,111,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
