You play as a nameless adventurer attempting to escape a living, magical dungeon that reconstructs itself each time you play, with only one way out - down. Craft, equip, explore, and fight to stay alive as you delve deeper and face ever-greater threats in the twisting halls and endless chasms of the NECROPOLIS. Have no doubt, youâ€™re going to die - often! - but youâ€™ll improve your combat skills, available upgrades, and dungeon know-how with every playthrough, bringing you one step closer to the exit. (Warning: â€œJust one more timeâ€ mindset can be addicting.)\r\n\r\nIN NECROPOLIS, DEATH IS...\r\n...PERMANENT. Game Over? Jump right back in with a new adventurer and try again! \r\n...DIFFERENT EVERY TIME. A new procedurally-generated dungeon with every death. \r\n...MONSTROUS. Gemeaters, Changelings, Hoardmen, and more - they exist to kill you. \r\n...NOT WITHOUT PERKS. Each new dungeon is littered with powerful weapons, armor, and upgrades to wield against your foes. (And thereâ€™s crafting, too!) \r\n...UNAVOIDABLE. But donâ€™t worry, this NEXT playthrough is totally the one. Weâ€™ve got a good feeling about it.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: 7 or later\r\nProcessor: Intel Pentium Core 2 Duo E8500 3.17GHz or AMD Phenom II X2 555 3.2GHz \r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce 630 GT or AMD Radeon HD 6670 \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c \r\nHard drive: 5 GB available space \r\nSound Card: DirectX 9 sound device\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: 7 or later\r\nProcessor: Intel Pentium Core i3 2100 3.10GHz or AMD A8 3870K 3.0GHz \r\nMemory: 8 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750ti or AMD Radeon HD 7900 Series \r\nDirectX: Version 12 \r\nHard drive: 10 GB available space \r\nSound Card: DirectX 9 sound device","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c384fc78a7e53d3a36eb7464a61e6117800d4b8","amp;dn":"Necropolis%3A+A+Diabolical+Dungeon+Delve+%28v2.3.0.5%29+%5BGOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c384fc78a7e53d3a36eb7464a61e6117800d4b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,56,79,199,138,126,83,211,163,110,183,70,74,97,230,17,120,0,212,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
