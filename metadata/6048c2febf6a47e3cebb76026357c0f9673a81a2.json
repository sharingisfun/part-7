His unfinished novel The Man Without Qualities (German: Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften) is generally considered to be one of the most important modernist novels. However, the novel has not been widely read both because of its delayed publication and intricate, lengthy plot. It is, nonetheless, a significant literary achievement that foresaw the impending disaster in Europe after the first world war.\n\nAfter his death Musil's work was almost forgotten in German-speaking countries. His writings began to reappear during the early 1950s. The first translation of The Man Without Qualities in English was published by Ernst Kaiser and Eithne Wilkins in 1953, 1954 and 1960. An updated translation by Sophie Wilkins and Burton Pike, containing extensive selections from unpublished drafts, appeared in 1995. Musil's work has been getting more attention recently, including the philosophical aspects of his novels. The philosophy journal The Monist is seeking submissions for a special issue on &quot;The Philosophy of Robert Musil&quot; to be published in January 2014 and edited by Bence Nanay.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, all in ePUB format:\n\n* Diaries (1899-1942), Selected, Translated, Annotated, and with a Preface by Philip   Payne\n\n* Five Women, Translated by Eithne Wilkins and Ernst Kaiser\n\n* The Confusions of Young Torless,Translated by Eithne Wilkins and Ernst Kaiser \n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Musil&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Musil&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-qualities-of-Robert-Musil-3658&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-qualities-of-Robert-Musil-3658&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview28&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview28&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6048c2febf6a47e3cebb76026357c0f9673a81a2","amp;dn":"Robert+Musil+-+Austrian+Author+%283+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6048c2febf6a47e3cebb76026357c0f9673a81a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,72,194,254,191,106,71,227,206,187,118,2,99,87,192,249,103,58,129,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
