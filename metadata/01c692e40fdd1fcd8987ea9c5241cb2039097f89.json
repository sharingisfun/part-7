In this book, Matt Waters gives a detailed historical overview of the Achaemenid period while considering the manifold interpretive problems historians face in constructing and understanding its history. This book offers a Persian perspective even when relying on Greek textual sources and archaeological evidence. Waters situates the story of the Achaemenid Persians in the context of their predecessors in the mid-first millennium BCE and through their successors after the Macedonian conquest, constructing a compelling narrative of how the empire retained its vitality for more than two hundred years (c.550Ã¢â‚¬â€œ330 BCE) and left a massive imprint on Middle Eastern as well as Greek and European history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01c692e40fdd1fcd8987ea9c5241cb2039097f89","amp;dn":"Ancient+Persia+A+Concise+History+by+Matt+Waters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01c692e40fdd1fcd8987ea9c5241cb2039097f89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,198,146,228,15,221,31,205,137,135,234,156,82,65,203,32,57,9,127,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
