The group is best known for their songs &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Lies of the Beautiful People&quot;. The name Sixx:A.M. is a combination of all of the member's last names (Sixx, Ashba, Michael).\n\nThe band made their live debut at Crash Mansion on July 16, 2007. They performed five songs from the album, The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack. The album had no drummer, because lead singer/rhythm guitarist James Michael programmed all the drums. Due to this, there was some curiosity as to who would be playing drums for them live. Former Beautiful Creatures drummer Glen Sobel ended up playing on tour with the band.\n\nOn October 25, 2007, Sixx:A.M. played another show opening for Korn. At the time of this show, Glen Sobel was on tour drumming with Elliott Yamin.\n\nOriginally the group stated they had no intention of touring. After constant support for the band and interest in a tour, they held a nationwide vote for tour dates. The tour was scheduled to start in spring 2008, but was postponed to the summer due to unforeseeable circumstances.\n\nOn April 2009, both James Michael and Sixx confirmed that the band was in the studio, recording new material. Sixx added that the new material was &quot;inspiring. it feels like we may have topped ourselves on this album coming up, and can't wait for you to hear what it sounds like.&quot; He also revealed that the new album, like the first, would be a concept album, but refused to reveal more details about the concept. He also added that a &quot;surprise&quot;, possibly a new song, might be coming soon, and that the album would probably be ready in mid/late 2010.\n\nOn December 5, 2011, lead singer James Michael has announced that the band would be releasing an acoustic EP entitled 7 on December 13, 2011, which will feature 7 new acoustic renditions to previously released songs from the band's previous two studio albums. Michael has also hinted on an upcoming surprise release from the band.\n\nOn July 18, 2013, they have a new song called &quot;Relief&quot;' for their 3rd album.\n\nOn January 14, 2014, the band announced that the final song on the next album is titled &quot;Let it Haunt You (So Beautiful)&quot; via their Facebook.\n\nOn July 31, 2014, the band announced that the title for their third album will be &quot;Modern Vintage&quot; Set to release on October 7th, 2014.\n\nFile Name Size\nSixxAM2014/05.
