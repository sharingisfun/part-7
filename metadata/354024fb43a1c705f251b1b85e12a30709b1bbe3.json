The title of \nthe album comes from the title of a book of the same name by C.S. Lewis, \nan author favored by band members Ty Tabor and Jerry Gaskill.\n\nKing's X came roaring out of Houston, TX with a progressive metal sound \nthat was a cross between Black Sabbath, Metallica, and Rush with layered \nvocals harmonies that some have dubbed Beatle-esque. \n\nThe band is a critics favorite as well as a favorite of musicians, they \nhad big label backing for years and even played Woodstock '94, yet somehow \nthey never seemed to break it big in the mainstream.\n__________\n\n 1.
