This torrent contains the last of that music, along with a few additional titles (to round out the two gig bundle limit) that may be new to some of you.\n\nThank you to everyone who has been able to help me seed these past few days.  Every little bit helped.  And thank you to all of you who stick around and continue to share this music with others, after I've moved onto the next bundle.\n\nI'm looking forward to the 57th bundle for a couple of reasons.  It will represent equaling the number of bundles we shared amongst ourselves back in 2013.  It will contain more music that may be new to many of you.  It will mean I am finally caught up, and so too will you be.\n\nCHRISTMAS: Guy Penrod, Michael W Smith, Various Christmas.
