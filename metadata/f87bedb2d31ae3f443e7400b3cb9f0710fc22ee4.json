But when it comes to Stones Throw-signed duo Myron &amp; E, all it takes is one listen to their full-length debut, Broadway, and you immediately know their aim. These two are relentlessly passionate about classic soul and R&amp;B, and you can hear it at the core of their songwriting. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no pretense, fraudulence, or tongue-in-cheek irony; Myron Glasper and Eric Ã¢â‚¬Å“EÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Cooke are just two (very talented) guys from Los Angeles and Newark, N.J., respectively, who want to make music similar to that of their heroes. And by all accounts, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done it.\nOn Stones ThrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s artist site for the duo, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a quote from E in which he speaks highly of his backing band, European seven-piece the Soul Investigators. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really think thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s anybody else that can do it as good as they can,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said, adding: Ã¢â‚¬Å“They do it like none other.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ That might seem like your typical artist-singing-high-praises-because-of-course-he-is, but the Soul Investigators really earned their name here. While it would be easy to simply shower them with praise for their tight playing and fantastic arrangements, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even more notable that they wrote many of their compositions through actual investigating. E apparently made it a common practice to send YouTube links of his favorite soul and R&amp;B tunes of yore to the band for inspiration. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s safe to say that his method worked.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Cold GameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an instant standout, and its success goes beyond the sharp songwriting of Myron &amp; E and their harmonizing. The funky cut, which previously appeared on a limited 45 single, is where the Soul Investigators are just straight showing off. Everything you want to hear in a track like this Ã¢â‚¬â€ brass, well-placed strings, caffeinated drums Ã¢â‚¬â€ hits you with an outright infectiousness. Then the organ solo melts your face and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re left picking your jaw off the floor before the vocals return. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funk-infused soul done right and, more importantly, done well without sacrificing a damn thing.\nThe same can be said for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Turn BackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which opens the album with a world-weary look at society and life as a whole. The main message through is that Myron &amp; E want to make things right before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late and while that might read as corny, the way itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delivered is what makes it work. Additionally, the backing of melancholic strings and guitars makes it seem like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re hearing the final words of a wise man. Similarly, closer Ã¢â‚¬Å“They DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t KnowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ strikes you with its contemplative tone. The duo shares words of hope that people all over the world, not just in your hood or your town, will come together to make this Ã¢â‚¬Å“thingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ work. That Ã¢â‚¬Å“thing,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ of course, can be interpreted subjectively, but the WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Going On atmosphere makes it feel like a Ã¢â‚¬Å“we need to do better!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ battle-cry delivered with a whisper. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forceful without shoving anything down your throat. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an approach to which more singers should aspire.\nElsewhere, Myron &amp; E and the Soul Investigators take a dip into psychedelic soul with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Back N ForthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do It Do It DiscoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is straight-up dance floor goodness without the glossy, coked-out sound of the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s and early Ã¢â‚¬â„¢80s. Cuts like this are both inspiring and pure ear-candy, because they provide a strong dose of variety without failing to maintain the cohesive nature of Broadway. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true that the majority of the album is on that love-centric tipÃ¢â‚¬â€see the unstoppable run from Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I Gave You My LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cold GameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€but Myron &amp; E shine equally as bright when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re venturing into other territory. This is, above all else, the mark of truly refined songwriting, as is the fact that you will not be able to get many of the hooks and melodies out of your head. Embrace it, because hopefully this is just the beginning of lasting relationship between Myron &amp; E, the Soul Investigators, and Stones Throw. I give it 4 out of 5.\nReview by Andrew Martin\n\n\nTracklist:\n01. Turn Back\n02. Broadway\n03. If I Gave You My Love\n04. Everyday Love\n05. I Can't Let You Get Away\n06. Cold Game\n07.
