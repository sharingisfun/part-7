His instructional books have become some of the most sought after art books in the last decades. Most of his books have been out-of-print for decades, and command prices of hundreds of American dollars for a second-hand copy.\n\nIn recent years, various people managed to locate most of his instructional books, and made them public online. This is an amazing gift - one that shouldn&amp;#039;t be overlooked or ignored.\n\nTo the youngest generation of aspiring artists the Loomis books are perhaps taken for granted, not regarded nearly as seriously as they should be. This is unfortunate - it&amp;#039;s as if people are passing up the chance to be taught by one of the best art teachers that ever lived - FOR FREE. Loomis books like &quot;Creative Illustration&quot;, &quot;Figure Drawing For All It&amp;#039;s Worth&quot;, &quot;Successful Drawing&quot;, &quot;Eye of the Painter&quot;..etc are equivalent of years of the best art school education money can buy. Even advanced professional artists can still learn a thing or two from the teachings of Loomis.\n\nIf you are a beginner, you need Loomis. Don&amp;#039;t go searching for some kind of magical tutorial that will miraculously turn you into a better artist overnight - such a thing does not exist. Your best chance at improving and growing is to read the Loomis books from cover to cover, to do all the exercises provided in them. If you can master the contents, you will become a master artist yourself. That is not an exaggeration - that&amp;#039;s a promise.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d703148e6adae4b101dcd26725e6e06302febbd6","amp;dn":"Andrew+Loomis+-+drawing+books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d703148e6adae4b101dcd26725e6e06302febbd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,3,20,142,106,218,228,177,1,220,210,103,37,230,224,99,2,254,187,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
