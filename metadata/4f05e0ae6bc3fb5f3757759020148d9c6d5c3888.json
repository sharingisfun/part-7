Biofuels offer an alternative to fossil fuels, but first-generation biofuels had many challenges to be overcome. One strategy that second-generation biofuels are employing is microbial technology.\n\n\n\nThis compendium volume gathers together recent investigations within this vital field of research. It offers:\n\n\n\n\nAn overview of the topic\n\nInvestigations into the varieties of microorganisms useful for this technology\n\nPretreatment methodologies\n\nGenetic engineering research that will further this technology\n\n\nInternationally recognized experts contribute chapters on their individual areas of research within this vital field of study. The book offers an authoritative platform from which graduate students and scientists can build future investigations that will create still more advanced biofuels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f05e0ae6bc3fb5f3757759020148d9c6d5c3888","amp;dn":"New+Microbial+Technologies+for+Advanced+Biofuels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f05e0ae6bc3fb5f3757759020148d9c6d5c3888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,5,224,174,107,195,251,95,55,87,117,144,32,20,141,156,109,92,56,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
