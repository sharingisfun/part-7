[ISO] :!:\n............................................................\n\n\n\n\n:::: INFO ::::\n\nTackle any project and achieve the results you want in less time. AutodeskÃ‚Â® 3ds MaxÃ‚Â® 9 software lets you manage complex data and scale your team to meet the needs of next-generation production pipelines.\n\nPerformance\nWork with ever-increasing amounts of data and more complex scenes. The new 64-bit version of Autodesk 3ds Max 9 takes advantage of the latest technology advancements, to address challenges you face in next-generation production pipelines.\n\nProductivity\nQuickly model inorganic shapes with Pro Booleans. Place animation into separate layers to easily tweak dense and complex animations. View scene complexity statistics along with the resulting frame rate to measure and optimize scene performance. Feature enhancements in 3ds Max 9?such as faster solving of complex cloth dynamics?deliver the speed and precision needed to meet time-sensitive production deadlines.\n\nPipeline Efficiencies\nEasily share files, track work-in-progress assets, and customize production pipelines to accelerate creative workflows. Improvements to &quot;XRefs&quot; for better interaction with linked assets, support for relative paths, and AutodeskÃ‚Â® Vault functionality help production teams optimize workflow and manage collaboration among members of a creative team.\n\nRendering Enhancements\nProduce stunning photo-real imagery. Use new mental rayÃ‚Â® 3.5 shaders to easily create beautiful skies with shadows from the sun or simulate metallic car paint. In addition, new presets for ambient occlusion, rounded corner effects, reflections, and refractions make it easier to achieve realistic, stunning results. Harness the full power of the mental ray rendering engine within Autodesk 3ds Max 9 software.\n\nCreate rich and complex design visualization. Generate realistic characters for a top-selling game. Bring 3D effects to the big screen. Autodesk 3ds Max 2008 3D modeling, animation, and rendering software helps design visualization professionals, game developers, and visual effects artists maximize their productivity by streamlining the process of working with complex scenes. \n\n\n\n:::: WHAT IS NEW ::::\n\n\nNew Polygon Modeling Workflow\nA collection of ?hands-on? modeling options, new in AutodeskÃ‚Â® 3ds MaxÃ‚Â® 2008, lets you take advantage of a more streamlined, artist-friendly modeling workflow. This video introduces you to two of these new options: temporary pivot overrides and a new subobject previewing workflow that lets you preview and select subobjects in one fluid motion and switch between subobject modes in the viewport. You?ll also learn how to take advantage of the new Multiple UV Unwrap operation?a feature that makes it significantly easier to organize the mapping of multiple objects into one texture.\n\nPerformance Enhancements\nAutodesk 3ds Max 2008 delivers new technology and optimizations that result in vastly improved performance for even the largest, most complex scenes. This video will demonstrate how new adaptive degradation enhancements ensure your viewport interaction rates by automatically simplifying scenes to meet target frame rates. When combined with the new Direct3D mesh caching, which groups objects by materials, the result is that tens of thousands of objects become just as interactive as ten objects. Plus, you?ll see how easy it is to control the degree to which 3ds Max simplifies your scene: You just select a desired level of viewport interactivity and 3ds Max calculates how best to achieve it.\n\nReview Rendering\nThe powerful, new Review rendering toolset gives you immediate feedback on various render settings, enabling you to iterate rapidly. This means you can now quickly hone in on your desired look without waiting for a software render?perfect for over-the-shoulder client/boss feedback sessions and other iterative workflows. This video demonstrates the Review rendering toolset?s ability to deliver interactive viewport previewing of shadows, its improved workflow for those using the 3ds Max Sun/Sky system, and new mental ray Architectural and Design material settings. You?ll also learn how to take advantage of the new mental ray Sky Portal system?a workflow that simplifies the process of lighting indoor scenes with outdoor lighting.\n\nAutodesk 3ds Max/Revit Interoperability\nDeeper support in 3ds Max 2008 for the DWG? file format results in faster, more accurate importing of data from other popular Autodesk applications such as RevitÃ‚Â® Architecture 2008. This video will introduce you to two new features that streamline 3ds Max/Revit workflows: support for DWG solids?including all materials assigned to these objects?and support for imported Sun/Sky/geographic location parameters, including time of day and time zone.\n\nAutodesk 3ds Max/mental ray Enhancements\nA number of major enhancements to mental ray and the 3ds Max 2008/mental ray workflow will help you to achieve your desired look faster. This video introduces you to\n\n* The Sky Portal workflow for lighting indoor scenes with outdoor lighting\n* The self-illumination feature for mental ray Architecture and Design materials\n* The Render to Texture presets\n* The photographic exposure UI?a camera-based interface for managing exposure settings (tone-mapping) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9936f2dad47d2974b2a1d80b8364ceec1cedce7e","amp;dn":"Autodesk+3D+Studio+MAX+9+%282008%29+FULL+%2B+KEYGEN%21+%5BISO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9936f2dad47d2974b2a1d80b8364ceec1cedce7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,54,242,218,212,125,41,116,178,161,216,11,131,100,206,236,28,237,206,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
