When the swashbuckler is injured, he turns his sword over to the swishbuckler, who is just as good a swordsman, though a few shades less fiery. Hamilton easily handles the comedy demands of the dual roles, and has strong support from Ron Leibman as the chief bad guy.\n\n  Starring: George Hamilton, Lauren Hutton, Brenda Vaccaro, Ron Leibman, Donovan Scott.\n\n  Directed by: Peter Medak.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 33min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 448","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6106a7242c8e00dbf10215917b545a049733ab0","amp;dn":"Zorro+the+Gay+Blade+%281981%29+%28George+Hamilton%2C+Ron+Leibman%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6106a7242c8e00dbf10215917b545a049733ab0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,16,106,114,66,200,224,13,191,16,33,89,23,181,69,160,73,115,58,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
