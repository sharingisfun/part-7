While it might not be as innovative as some of their other work, the music makes for a lovely disc, especially when the impassioned vocals of Leo Vera lead the songs.\n \n ValdÃƒÂ©s himself keeps his furious, formidable technique in check, leading from the back (although he does take a luscious, Ellington-esque solo on &quot;Como Fue&quot;). Instead, it's the material that's the star, whether as familiar as the standard &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; or the lovely &quot;Alma Mia.&quot; The horn charts are inventive, filling out the songs without ever seeming to dominate. These time-tested ballads are, in fact, hard to forget, and they have held up well over the years.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Unforgettable BolerosÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is heartfelt and consistently rewarding.\n\n\n\n\nIrakere featuring Chucho ValdÃƒÂ©s\n\n Boleros Inigualables / Unforgettable Boleros\n\n 1996 / 2000\n\n\n \n\n CD / 2000 / 320Kbps\n\n\n\n Tracklist:\n\n 1.
