The movie chronicles the tale of two undercover narcotic offices who in the course of their jobs become heroin addicts themselves. The album is made up of mostly instrumentals that has a dark and mellow nature that underscores the decent into drug addicted hell the two cops spiral into. Mr. Clapton himself was facing tragedy as he was recording the album, his four year old son Conner, was killed when he accidentally fell out of a window. To memorialize his son, he wrote and recorded one of most haunting and elegant songs ever written about the loss of loved one, &quot;Tears In Heaven&quot;. The song would go on to bigger fame in it's Unplugged version, but the studio version is equally beautiful and worth buying the album for alone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c5926d2787221bfe6fed599f5a7d432ae93f6b3","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack+-+Eric+Clapton+320cbr+1992+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c5926d2787221bfe6fed599f5a7d432ae93f6b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,89,38,210,120,114,33,191,230,254,213,153,245,167,212,50,174,147,246,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
