Eschewing a strict chronological approach, the best-of sets are arranged according to charting position. Thus the initial collection is laden with the group's trademark tunes, ranging from the California boys' first top 10 charter, 1962's &quot;Surfin' \n Safari,&quot; to their last, 1988's &quot;Kokomo,&quot; a stray, post-Brian Wilson success. &quot;Kokomo&quot; is by far the newest selection included here; nothing else dates past 1966's No. 1 smash, &quot;Good Vibrations.&quot; With the likes of &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun,&quot; &quot;I Get Around,&quot; &quot;California Girls,&quot; and the incandescent &quot;God Only Knows&quot; rounding out the set, Greatest Hits Volume 1 is the ideal first pick for anyone looking for the Beach Boys at their commercial peak. --Steven Stolder \n  \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Surfin' safari [02:06] \n 02.Surfin' U.S.A.
