In fact, he\\&amp;#039;s doing just fine as long as the blacks don\\&amp;#039;t move in and ruin his neighborhood. But Jeff\\&amp;#039;s bigoted world is rocked when his skin unexplainably turns dark overnight. Now shunned by white people, Jeff begins to see the light with help from some new black friends.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfe68a542b1750f18b60bc038620a4359b5d4270","amp;dn":"Watermelon+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfe68a542b1750f18b60bc038620a4359b5d4270","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,230,138,84,43,23,80,241,139,96,188,3,134,32,164,53,155,93,66,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
