Johal (CRC, 2011).pdf\r\n\r\nWith a selective presentation of topics that makes it accessible for students who have taken introductory university science courses, Understanding Nanomaterials is a training tool for the future workforce in nanotech development. This introductory textbook offers insights into the fundamental principles that govern the fabrication, characterization, and application of nanomaterials.\r\n\r\nProvides the Background for Fundamental Understanding\r\n\r\nAssuming only a basic level of competency in physics, chemistry, and biology, the author focuses on the needs of the undergraduate curriculum, discussing important processes such as self-assembly, patterning, and nanolithography. His approach limits mathematical rigor in the presentation of key results and proofs, leaving it to the instructorâ€™s discretion to add more advanced details, or emphasize particular areas of interest.\r\n\r\nWith its combination of discussion-based instruction and explanation of problem-solving skills, this textbook highlights interdisciplinary theory and enabling tools derived from chemistry, biology, physics, medicine, and engineering. It also includes real-world examples related to energy, the environment, and medicine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83397f5850cdcbaf8f1a2801e81fefcccea94715","amp;dn":"Understanding+Nanomaterials+-+Malkiat+S.+Johal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83397f5850cdcbaf8f1a2801e81fefcccea94715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,57,127,88,80,205,203,175,143,26,40,1,232,31,239,204,206,169,71,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
