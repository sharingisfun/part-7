Patissier Eric Lanlard, whose clientele includes Madonna, Elton John, Liz Hurley, and the Beckhams, presents 25 amazing cakes, all with top tips to help home bakers produce spectacular effects on the palate and the eye. Each of Lanlard's masterpieces comes illustrated with step-by-step photography of the cake's assembly and decoration, plus a full-page photo of the finished creation. These showstoppers range from a towering croquembouche to a glittering symphony of butterflies, a magnificent hand-painted Toile de Jouy wedding cake to a delicious 1920's-inspired American retro cake. Smaller, but equally delicious, treats include Marie Antoinette Macaroons. A comprehensive introductory section covers the basics, so anyone can make cakes that look beautiful and taste wonderful.\n\n\nPlz Seed...\n\nThnXX...\n\nmAnaV...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2580665a5f729504ae6c768ccc25613bbe2888f8","amp;dn":"Glamour+Cakes+by+Eric+Lanlard+%28mAnaV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2580665a5f729504ae6c768ccc25613bbe2888f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,128,102,90,95,114,149,4,174,108,118,140,204,37,97,59,190,40,136,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
