There's also a bunch of books tangentially related to that such as the few books on songwriting and the books on daily life in various historical periods that are in the folder appropriately named DAILY LIFE. If you're not interested in those, feel free to untick them. I cleaned up the folder and file names as much as I could but it's all still a bit messy. Sorry.\n\nIf you have any suggestions, leave a comment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7f17e069bb66b1b8020aa6d062e59fe9cb004fe","amp;dn":"Screenwriting%2C+Fiction+and+Comedy+Writing+Manual+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7f17e069bb66b1b8020aa6d062e59fe9cb004fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,241,126,6,155,182,107,27,128,32,170,109,6,46,89,254,156,176,4,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
