Now in a thrilling new fantasy series, enter a world inhabited by the Others, unearthly entitiesÃ¢â‚¬â€vampires and shape-shifters among themÃ¢â‚¬â€who rule the Earth and whose prey are humans.\n\nAs a cassandra sangue, or blood prophet, Meg Corbyn can see the future when her skin is cutÃ¢â‚¬â€a gift that feels more like a curse. MegÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Controller keeps her enslaved so he can have full access to her visions. But when she escapes, the only safe place Meg can hide is at the Lakeside CourtyardÃ¢â‚¬â€a business district operated by the Others.\n\nShape-shifter Simon Wolfgard is reluctant to hire the stranger who inquires about the Human Liaison job. First, he senses sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s keeping a secret, and second, she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t smell like human prey. Yet a stronger instinct propels him to give Meg the job. And when he learns the truth about Meg and that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wanted by the government, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to decide if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth the fight between humans and the Others that will surely follow.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bbade2336935b6f8c0381e7aa53aeebe707e2bb","amp;dn":"Written+In+Red+-+Anne+Bishop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bbade2336935b6f8c0381e7aa53aeebe707e2bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,186,222,35,54,147,91,111,140,3,129,231,170,83,174,235,231,7,226,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
