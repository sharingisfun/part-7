At the same time, Teddy, PJ, and Gabe try to deal with school and typical social challenges in their life.[5]\nThe events of each episode become material for a video diary Teddy is making for her younger sister. Teddy hopes the videos will provide useful advice for Charlie after they have both grown up and Teddy has moved out. Also at the end of each video, she (and or other cast members) states, &quot;Good luck, Charlie&quot; or may even say it indirectly such as &quot;Wish them good luck, Charlie&quot;\n\nGood Luck Charlie S01E21 - Teddy's Broken Heart Club Band\nGood Luck Charlie S01E23 - Pushing Buttons\nGood Luck Charlie S01E24 - Snow Show (Part 1)\nGood Luck Charlie S01E22 - Teddy Rebounds\nGood Luck Charlie S01E26 - Driving Mrs. Dabney\nGood Luck Charlie S01E20 - Girl Bites Dog\nGood Luck Charlie S01E25 - Snow Show (Part2\nGood Luck Charlie S01E05 - Dance Off\nGood Luck Charlie S01E12 - Kit and Kaboodle\nGood Luck Charlie S01E09 - Up a Tree\nGood Luck Charlie S01E11 - Boys Meets Girls\nGood luck Charlie S01E10 -Take Mel Out to the Ball\nGood Luck Charlie S01E08 - Charlie is 1\nGood Luck Charlie S01E04 - Double Whammy\nGood Luck Charlie S01E19 - Sleepless in Denver\nGood Luck Charlie S01E18 - Charlie in Charge\nGood Luck Charlie S01E15 - Charlie Goes Viral\nGood Luck Charlie S01E14 - Blankie Go Bye-Bye\nGood Luck Charlie S01E13 - Teddy's Little Helper\nGood Luck Charlie S01E06 - Charlie Did It!\nGood Luck Charlie S01E01 - Study Date\nGood Luck Charlie S01E16 - Duncans Got Talent\nGood Luck Charlie S01E07 - Butt Dialing Duncans\nGood Luck Charlie S01E03 - The Curious Case of Mr. Dabney\nGood Luck Charlie S01E17 - Kwikki Chick\nGood Luck Charlie S01E02 - Baby Come Back\n\nFor More information Goto\n[url]http://tv.disney.go.com/disneychannel/goodluckcharlie/characters/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3828575aa582928d42247ba583d339f8a2828191","amp;dn":"Good+Luck+Charlie+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3828575aa582928d42247ba583d339f8a2828191","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,40,87,90,165,130,146,141,66,36,123,165,131,211,57,248,162,130,129,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
