It is set in a fictional Victorian era village in Europe. Johnny Depp led an all-star cast as the voice of Victor, while Helena Bonham Carter voiced Emily, the title character. Corpse Bride is the second stop-motion feature film produced by Tim Burton (not including his short film Vincent), the first being The Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\nThe film was nominated in the 78th Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature, but was bested by Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. It was shot with a battery of Canon EOS-1D Mark II digital SLRs, rather than the 35mm film cameras used for Burton's previous stop-motion film The Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\n\n\n\nCorpse Bride 2005\n\n\nThe Tim Burton's Corpse Bride soundtrack, written by Danny Elfman with the help of John August, contains the music, including all of the songs, from the 2005 film.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Main Title&quot; (Score)\n2.\t&quot;According to Plan&quot; \n3.\t&quot;Victor's Piano Solo&quot; (Score)\n4.\t&quot;Into the Forest&quot; (Score)\n5.\t&quot;Remains of the Day&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Casting a Spell&quot; (Score)\n7.\t&quot;Moon Dance&quot; (Score)\n8.\t&quot;Victor's Deception&quot; (Score)\n9.\t&quot;Tears to Shed&quot; \n10.\t&quot;Victoria's Escape&quot; (Score)\n11.\t&quot;The Piano Duet&quot; (Score)\n12.\t&quot;New Arrival&quot; (Score)\n13.\t&quot;Victoria's Wedding&quot; (Score)\n14.\t&quot;The Wedding Song&quot; \n15.\t&quot;The Party Arrives&quot; (Score)\n16.\t&quot;Victor's Wedding&quot; (Score)\n17.\t&quot;Barkis's Bummer&quot; (Score)\n18.\t&quot;The Finale&quot; (Score)\n19.\t&quot;End Credits&quot; (Part 1) (Score)\n20.\t&quot;End Credits&quot; (Part 2) (Score)\n\n\nBonus Tracks from Bojangles and his Bone Boys \n\n\n\n21.\t&quot;Ball &amp; Socket Lounge Music #1&quot; (Band Version) (Score)\n22.\t&quot;Remains of the Day&quot; (Combo Lounge Version) (Score)\n23.\t&quot;Ball &amp; Socket Lounge Music #2&quot; (Score)\n24.\t&quot;Ball &amp; Socket Lounge Music #1&quot; (Combo Version) (Score)\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:384683dd38cde10d570a48da866b15c2d05b3cca","amp;dn":"Corpse+Bride+-+Soundtrack+2005+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"384683dd38cde10d570a48da866b15c2d05b3cca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,70,131,221,56,205,225,13,87,10,72,218,134,107,21,194,208,91,60,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
