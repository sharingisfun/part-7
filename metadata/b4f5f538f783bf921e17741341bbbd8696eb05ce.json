Written by AgilentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s measurement experts, it offers a valuable insight into LTE technology and its design and test challenges. Chapters cover the upper layer signaling and system architecture evolution (SAE). Basic concepts such as MIMO and SC-FDMA, the new uplink modulation scheme, are introduced and explained, and the authors look into the challenges of verifying the designs of the receivers, transmitters and protocols of LTE systems. The latest information on RF and signaling conformance testing is delivered by authors participating in the LTE 3GPP standards committees.\n\nThis second edition has been considerably revised to reflect the most recent developments of the technologies and standards. Particularly important updates include an increased focus on LTE-Advanced as well as the latest testing specifications.\n\n- Fully updated to include the latest information on LTE 3GPP standards\n- Chapters on conformance testing have been majorly revised and there is an  increased focus on LTE-Advanced\n- Includes new sections on testing challenges as well as over the air MIMO testing, protocol testing and the most up-to-date test capabilities of instruments\n- Written from both a technical and practical point of view by leading experts in the field \n\nAuthor Information :\n--------------------\n\nMoray Rumney, Lead Technologist, Agilent Technologies, USA Moray Rumney has enjoyed a varied career path, spanning manufacturing engineering, product development, applications engineering, and most recently technical marketing. His main focus has been the development and system design of base station emulators used in the development and testing of cellular phones. Moray currently represents Agilent at RAN WG4, developing the air interface for HSPA+ and LTE. He has published many technical articles in the field of cellular communications and is a regular speaker and chairman at industry conferences\n\nAgilent Technologies A leader in test and measurement solutions, Agilent Technologies is at the forefront of emerging wireless and broadband markets.
