Slapstick, funny, romantic, great cast. Just a good old fashion family film.\n\nFull screen, color, quality is good enough to be a dvdrip but I&amp;#039;m not sure that it was.  It may be a high quality VHS. It shows up very good on 22 inch wide screen monitor.  English only, no subs.\n\n\nIMDB:\nBoisterous nightclub entertainer Buzzy Bellew was the witness to a murder committed by gangster Ten Grand Jackson. One night, two of Jackson&amp;#039;s thugs kill Buzzy and dump his body in the lake at Prospect Park in Brooklyn. Buzzy comes back as a ghost and summons his bookworm twin, Edwin Dingle, to Prospect Park so that he can help the police nail Jackson.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:451a0a15d3ff09f99388c12e47ec569551d20a0e","amp;dn":"Wonder+Man+-+%28Danny+Kaye+1945%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"451a0a15d3ff09f99388c12e47ec569551d20a0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,26,10,21,211,255,9,249,147,136,193,46,71,236,86,149,81,210,10,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
