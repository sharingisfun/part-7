However, the label would not publish the record under any other name than Bruce Dickinson. The album sounds quite different from Bruce's other solo works. Most songs in this album have the central theme being science and/or related themes. Furthermore, the songs are relatively short, with most running around 3 minutes. The band didn't last and for his next solo project, Accident of Birth, he teamed up with guitarist Roy Z.\n\nIn 2005, Skunkworks was re-released and the 2005 extended version included songs performed live, such as &quot;Inertia&quot;, &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Innerspace&quot;, &quot;The Prisoner&quot; and other previously unreleased songs.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Bruce Dickinson - vocals\n    * Alex Dickson - Guitar\n    * Chris Dale - Bass guitar\n    * Alessandro Elena - drums\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b093c2b742a82a0b836f09e0ca21d6e3a006b08e","amp;dn":"Bruce+Dickinson+-+%5C%27Skunkworks+%5BDELUXE%5D%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b093c2b742a82a0b836f09e0ca21d6e3a006b08e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,147,194,183,66,168,42,11,131,111,9,224,202,33,214,227,160,6,176,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
