I have a personal friend who worked on this project, and the movies are hard to find on the internet and rarely get rerun, so I want to make sure people can see these engaging documentaries.\n\n\n\nFrom ESPN's 30 for 30 official site for Without Bias:\n\nMore than two decades after his tragic cocaine overdose, the late Len Bias still leaves more questions than answers. When Bias dropped dead two days after the 1986 NBA Draft, he forever altered our perception of casual drug use and became the tipping point of America's drug crisis in the mid-80's. Future generations continue to face the harsh punishment of drug policies that were influenced by the public outcry after his heartbreaking death. Instead of becoming an NBA star, he became a one-man deterrent, the athlete who reminded everyone just how dangerous drug use can be. Amazingly, questions still linger about his death nearly a quarter-century later. How good could he have been in the pro ranks? Has he become underrated or overrated as the years pass? How could a University of Maryland superstar and Boston Celtics lottery pick be derailed by a cocaine binge? Was Bias a one-time user as we were led to believe, or was there a pattern of recreational use that led to his fatal last night? Did he fall in with the wrong crowd? In the most ambitious, comprehensive and uncompromising account of BiasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ life and death ever captured on film, up-and-coming director Kirk Fraser utilizes dozens of interviews with BiasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ closest teammates, friends and family in an effort to determine exactly what happened on that fateful night. Maybe it wasn't as much of a fluke as we thought.\n\n\nAbout 30 for 30:\n\n[30 for 30] is an unprecedented documentary series featuring thirty films from some of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest storytellers. Each filmmaker will bring their passion and personal point of view to their film detailing the issues, trends, athletes, teams, rivalries, games and events that transformed the sports landscape from 1979 to 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9168f2ae18bb886b3e91d3b8dbc9a078536cee9d","amp;dn":"ESPN+-+30+for+30%3A+Without+Bias+%28HD+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9168f2ae18bb886b3e91d3b8dbc9a078536cee9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,104,242,174,24,187,136,107,62,145,211,184,219,201,160,120,83,108,238,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
