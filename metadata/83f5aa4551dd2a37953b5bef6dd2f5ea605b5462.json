Using greenscreens is a common practice in today's VFX workflow, so understanding how to get a good alpha from greenscreen footage is very important. We'll begin this tutorial by learning what a chroma key is and what we need to look out for while we shoot the greenscreen footage. From there, we begin keying a sample shot using the Keylight keyer. We'll then learn how to refine our matte and edge using the various built-in modifiers. Finally, we will composite our keyed footage over a background and learn about spill suppression and some compositing tricks to integrate our pieces of footage. We'll end the tutorial by learning a method of treating compressed or chroma subsampled footage to pull better keys.\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83f5aa4551dd2a37953b5bef6dd2f5ea605b5462","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Multi-part+Greenscreen+Keying+in+After+Effects+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83f5aa4551dd2a37953b5bef6dd2f5ea605b5462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,245,170,69,81,221,42,55,149,59,91,239,109,210,245,234,96,91,84,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
