Told in a sentimental tone, Burns weaves a lyrical tale of the great metropolis that encompasses not only the city&amp;#039;s streets, but also that of the history of America. Though around fourteen hours in length, this epic documentary presents a thoughtful, entertaining look at our relatively young country.\n\nI have a very slow connection so please share and if you can upload it to file storing servers that&amp;#039;s even better. Just add links in comments.\n\n\n\n\nxxxyyyzzz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6889f6cbf47c0828578125f1e078cda61140f9bd","amp;dn":"New+York%2C+A+Documentary+Film+-+05+-+Cosmopolis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6889f6cbf47c0828578125f1e078cda61140f9bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,137,246,203,244,124,8,40,87,129,37,241,224,120,205,166,17,64,249,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
