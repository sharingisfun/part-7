These tracks were taken from the available Abraham-Hicks torrents. There are many torrents with parenting questions in them that are not included here since they have track titles such as Track 1, Track 2, etc. There will be editing involved and I have not taken the time to do that as of yet. Obviously this is only a fraction of the parenting questions that Abraham has answered over the years of recorded material, but it is a good sampling and it has been numbered so that it can be added to easily in the future when other tracks are found that one would want to add.\n\nEnjoy and Please Seed!!\n\n001 - Child's demand for co-creation is irritating mother 21.08\n002 - Not create dependent children 2.59\n003 - When bad happens to children 8.06\n004 - Mom fears child's consequences 16.10\n005 - Teaching Children To Trust Own Guidance System [1] 5.0\n006 - Teaching Children To Trust Own Guidance System [2] 5.0\n007 - Children know that they know 6.46\n008 - Child feels better when beating others up 5.09\n009 - Her child is stealing things 19.20\n010 - Why is child rejecting motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s positive suggestions 5.34\n011 - On raising positive children 2.54\n012 - When Children are competitive 11.25\n013 - But childs All-Is-Wellness 12.29\n014 - Children and Law of Attraction 11.54\n015 - Is not parenting co-creating 13.45\n016 - Tell children of past wrongs 4.48\n017 - To best guide her children 9.49\n018 - Allowing your child to not be an allower 11.03\n019 - Delightful, maddening children 11.24\n020 - Feels trapped with children 17.39\n021 - When Children fear judgement 9.58\n022 - Can children survive divorce 10.18\n023 - Child feels lack's frusration 3.29  \n024 - Must Children Be Influenced 14.11\n025 - It's parenting, or disciplining 3.17\n026 - Her children's idiosyncrosies 12.53\n027 - Child's experiencing contrast 10.59\n028 - Errant Child Responsibility 11.06\n029 - Children, Choices And Clay 5.43\n030 - My Child's natural evolution 15.58\n031 - To support her child's paths 5.07\n032 - Virtual reality to help child become independant 9.40\n033 - Being honest with children 4.36\n034 - Teach child rights and wrongs 5.56\n035 - If child patient can't speak 5.55\n036 - She has a question about 'Indigo Children' 12.32\n037 - To modify children's behavior 7.59\n038 - But, child's offensive language 7.49\n039 - Can she have a child and freedom 14.18\n040 - How to best parent her child 3.14\n041 - Deal with fear of child's fear 7.43\n042 - Child bullies make him angry 17.19\n043 - Child's comfort or discipline 7.24\n044 - Will divorce damage children 9.49\n045 - But his children want a dog 9.22 \n046 - Child's genetic drug desires 7.02\n047 - His Spanish speaking children 7.49\n048 - To protect small children 9.20\n049 - Developing a stronger bond with his children 14.24\n050 - Energy Of An Adopted Child 5.29\n051 - Should mother allow her teenager her head 7.02\n052 - Teen daughter is cutting self 15.24\n053 - Bothered by teenager attitude 11.44\n054 - A challenging teen daughter 13.16\n055 - Teen son viewed TV porn site 6.15\n056 - His young brother and sister feeling bullied 17.59\n057 - Words to share with teenagers 14.28\n058 - My Husband And My Teenage Son Do Not Get Along 8.28\n059 - My Children Fight Constantly And They Are Driving Me Crazy 12.25\n060 - My Children Have No Respect For Me 14.10\n061 - AB04 13 - Why Children Have Trauma 1.23\n062 - AB07 12 - Doomed By Childhood Influence 2.15\n063 - AB18 A - Parenting 43.13\n064 - AB18 B - Parenting 43.14\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:721d9fdb18a5fc5a5752aff6f4393fbecc354228","amp;dn":"Abraham+Hicks+-+Parenting+Compilation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"721d9fdb18a5fc5a5752aff6f4393fbecc354228","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,29,159,219,24,165,252,90,87,82,175,246,244,57,63,190,204,53,66,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
