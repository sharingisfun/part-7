Signature tunes such as &quot;Masochist&quot;, &quot;Vault&quot;, &quot;Back 2 You&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot;, which were released on labels such as Uprising Records, Renegade Hardware and Low Profile Records, have a darker, more amelodic air to them which is substantially absent from their later productions, which are generally leaning heavily towards a mainstream, dance-driven sound. Early work such as &quot;Another Planet&quot; however, seems to indicate an early affinity with a more global sound, similar to other Breakbeat Kaos artists such as DJ Fresh and Adam F.\n\n\nPendulum's current musical style consists of a fusion of electronica and alternative rock, with the inclusion of acoustic instruments. The band also occasionally employ electronic vocal effects similar to those used by the progressive metal band Cynic. Songs such as &quot;Propane Nightmares&quot;, &quot;Granite&quot; and &quot;Slam&quot; are synth-led, whilst others, such as &quot;Showdown&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;Comprachicos&quot;, are guitar-led. Bassist Gareth McGrillen stated in an interview on Channel 4 that they use 13 computers during the live performances, all of which are mixing up the sounds produced by the instruments in real time. Rob Swire stated in issues of TJECK magazine and Rock Sound magazine that he would like to begin producing songs with a punk style to them, excluding the inclusion of electronic sounds in the near future.\n\n- woollytorrent -\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cb0f566bf3e5858a6a4c8d4e474555b36482f70","amp;dn":"Pendulum+-+Full+Studio+Discography+-+woollytorrent-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cb0f566bf3e5858a6a4c8d4e474555b36482f70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,176,245,102,191,62,88,88,166,164,200,212,228,116,85,91,54,72,47,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
