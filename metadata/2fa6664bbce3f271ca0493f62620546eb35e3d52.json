Mainly because it&amp;#039;s taken almost solely from an Arab perspective: an Arab news media, living in a deeply Arab culture, and run by Arab men and women.\n\nThat&amp;#039;s not to say that what we see on NBC and Fox News here in the States is any less insightful. Skewed toward the Lazy-Boy recliner news watcher, the American news media is just as blind to its prejudices and half-truths as many other media outlets around the world.\n\nSo when I read reviews of this documentary and they lambaste it for being &quot;one-sided&quot;, I have to shrug and say, &quot;Yeah, so what news media do you watch?&quot; Covering the Iraq War, Al Jazeera focused on what happened and was happening from inside Bahgdad. A pretty risky proposition, a move that ends up killing one of their correspondents. Looking at the Ba&amp;#039;athists and other political affiliations within the country was interesting and, again, a bit skewed.\n\nThe anti-American sentiment can be felt smoldering under the surface of Al-Jazeera, too. But whether this is simply a survival strategy (they do have to live there after the Americans are gone) or real is anyone&amp;#039;s guess.\n\nThis IS a great documentary to watch, though. Being spoon fed Fox News&amp;#039; version of the war is just as blinding as Al Jazeera&amp;#039;s. But after watching CONTROL ROOM, I know now that somewhere between the American TV reports and Al Jazeera, the truth does lie. \n\n7/10 - http://imdb.com/title/tt0391024/\n\nAVI File Details\n==========================================================================================================\nName.........: Control Room (2004) Perils of War reporting, AlJazeera.vs.FOX, censorship, bais (XviD 1h26m) ConRes.avi\nFilesize.....: 699 MB (or 715,882 KB or 733,063,168 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:26:31 (155,571 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1010 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 111 kb/s (55/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.91\nFrame Size...: 576x304 (1.89:1) [=36:19]\nRipper ......: p2P2p\n\nEnjoy.. :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&lt;/a&gt; (Forums, Wiki, Blogs) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&lt;/a&gt; (Educational Tracker)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fa6664bbce3f271ca0493f62620546eb35e3d52","amp;dn":"Control+Room+%282004%29+Perils+of+War+reporting%2C+AlJazeera.vs.FOX%2C+c","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fa6664bbce3f271ca0493f62620546eb35e3d52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,166,102,75,188,227,242,113,202,4,147,246,38,32,84,110,179,94,61,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
