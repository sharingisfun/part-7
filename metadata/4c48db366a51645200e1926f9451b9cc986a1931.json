Am I my brothers keeper - or not? For Ayn Rand, the answer is an emphatic no. To Rand and the disciples of her Objectivist philosophy, self-sacrifice is as heinous an act as murdermurder of the soul.\n\nUpon publication, Atlas Shrugged was widely scorned by critics for its preposterous plot and one-dimensional characters. Intellectuals and academics from across the ideological spectrum roundly dismissed the new and original philosophy called Objectivism that Rand so compellingly illustrated in the novel.\n\nDespite this pummeling, Atlas became a best seller and has remained in print ever selling a healthy 75,000 or so copies each year. Then with the new century, sales began to increase dramatically. In 2007, its fiftieth anniversary year, Atlas sold a record 180,000 copies. Since then Atlas Shrugged published over a half century ago - has sold over a million copies.\n\nWhy? Because - as evidenced by pointed and frequent references to Rand and Atlas Shrugged in the media an increasing number of Americans right or wrong see their society devolving into a nightmare scenario like the one Rand projected over a half century ago.\n\nAyn Rand &amp; the Prophecy of Atlas Shrugged looks into Rands background for the ideas and philosophy that inspired and shaped her novel and seeks to determine whether America is indeed headed for the disastrous outcome she predicted.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c48db366a51645200e1926f9451b9cc986a1931","amp;dn":"Ayn+Rand+%26amp%3B+the+Prophecy+of+Atlas+Shrugged+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c48db366a51645200e1926f9451b9cc986a1931","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,72,219,54,106,81,100,82,0,225,146,111,148,81,185,204,152,106,25,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
