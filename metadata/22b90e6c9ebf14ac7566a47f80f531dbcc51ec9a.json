Grant and Robert E. Lee. But less than two decades before they faced each other as enemies at Appomattox, they had been brothers Ã¢â‚¬â€ both West Point graduates, both wearing blue, and both fighting in the same cadre in the Mexican War. They were not alone: Sherman, Davis, Jackson-nearly all of the Civil War's greatest soldiers had been forged in the heat of Vera Cruz and Monterrey.\n\nThe Mexican War has faded from our national memory, but it was a struggle of enormous significance: the first U.S. war waged on foreign soil; and it nearly doubled our nation. At this fascinating juncture of American history, a group of young men came together to fight as friends, only years later to fight as enemies. This is their story. Full of dramatic battles, daring rescues, secret missions, soaring triumphs and tragic losses, The Training Ground is history at its finest","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22b90e6c9ebf14ac7566a47f80f531dbcc51ec9a","amp;dn":"The+Training+Ground+%28Mex+War%29-Martin+Dugard+AZW3+EPUB+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22b90e6c9ebf14ac7566a47f80f531dbcc51ec9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,185,14,108,158,191,20,172,117,102,164,127,128,245,49,219,204,81,236,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
