Rather than leave the 60+ GB of files that will never be used on my external to take up space (which I could use for comic books), I'm going to burn them off to blu-ray data discs and file them away in hopes that they may be used at some point in the future.\n\nNo big descriptions or explanations with these - you either know what they are, and that you want them, or you don't.\n\nThis one is a collection of third party publications that I used (to varying degrees) while running my 3.0 and (mostly) 3.5 campaigns. A majority of them, if not all of them, are D20 based. I know a lot of these are available within other large &quot;collection&quot; torrents, but I didn't see any that had quite this many (or all of them) together in one place.\n\nThese uploads are definitely an experiment; if there is interest, I'll seed them for a while, but if there isn't, I'll have them deleted and &quot;file&quot; this stuff away.
