What is it that has made his legacy so utterly distinct from that of all other life forms, including even the human female? \n\nFollowing on from the international success of The Naked Woman, Desmond Morris investigates this intriguing evolutionary success story. The Naked Man is a study of the masculine body from head to toe, examining biological features of the male anatomy in illuminating detail and describing the many ways in which these features have been modified, suppressed, or exaggerated by local customs and changes in social fashions. This is a natural history of man, viewing him as a fascinating specimen of a far from rare, but nevertheless endangered species.\n\nISBN 0224080423 \nISBN13: 9780224080422","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90671bb008cacffb6d514e148418980c173cb9a3","amp;dn":"Desmond+Morris+-+2009+-+The+Naked+Man+-+A+Study+of+the+Male+Body","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90671bb008cacffb6d514e148418980c173cb9a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,103,27,176,8,202,207,251,109,81,78,20,132,24,152,12,23,60,185,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
