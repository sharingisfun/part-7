(CRC, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nKnowledge on endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) has increased dramatically during the last decade. Numerous research findings have been reported, making it an opportune time to provide a systematic update on EMFs.\r\n\r\nEndohedral Metallofullerenes: Basics and Applications presents the most comprehensive review on all aspects of EMFs including their generation, extraction and isolation, structural issues, theories, intrinsic properties, chemical behaviors, and potential applications. In this book, the editors have collected an impressive amount of information regarding this family of a truly sui generis form of matter.\r\n\r\nThe bookâ€™s authors were chosen for their specific expertise in EMF research and have been gathered from top research groups from around the world. Graduate students, newcomers to the field, and experienced researchers alike will find this book a highly useful reference on the topic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d8c70f3a3cc652a1384d864ab101cf91578e234","amp;dn":"Endohedral+Metallofullerenes+-+Basics+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d8c70f3a3cc652a1384d864ab101cf91578e234","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,140,112,243,163,204,101,42,19,132,216,100,171,16,28,249,21,120,226,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
