Emphasis is on the management of those clinical challenges commonly seen in practice that the community practitioner would normally handle without outside referral. The book offers comparisons of treatment approaches to difficult situations, allowing the reader to compare their current treatment approach to that of experts and others in the community.\n\nRadiation Oncology is organized in seven sections corresponding to the major treatment areas of radiation oncology. Each section includes three cases to illustrate specific clinical challenges for which there is no clear treatment protocol. The case discussion includes an expert opinion on optimal management along with alternatives from a second academic expert's perspective and from a community practitioner's perspective.\n\nRadiation Oncology features:\n\nEvidence-based approach to difficult management challenges in radiation oncology\nExpert authors provide evidence assessment and management summaries through presentation of relevant cases\nCommunity practitioner reviewers ensure real-world relevance of each discussion\nReviews the most relevant literature pertaining to the challenging scenarios clinicians encounter every day\nManagement alternatives allow discussion of the full range of management options and specifics for difficult problems including hardline recommendations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c2865277906fa503f9f46eeb8d42f4995bdde0f","amp;dn":"Radiation+Oncology-+William+Small+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c2865277906fa503f9f46eeb8d42f4995bdde0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,40,101,39,121,6,250,80,63,159,70,238,184,212,47,73,149,189,222,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
