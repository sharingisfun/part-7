Robert Christgau, the Dean of American\n Rock Critics, called Hendrix's versions of &quot;Red House&quot; and, &quot;Johnny B.\n Goode&quot; on this album &quot;definitive.&quot; Out of print in the US since 1974 and for\n more than two decades internationally, Hendrix In The West, has remained one\n of the most requested albums by fans to return to the commercial\n marketplace.\n\n Hendrix In The West will be reissued as an expanded single disc featuring\n five additional, previously unavailable performances. The album's iconic\n cover features a classic Jim Marshall photograph of the guitarist and the\n twenty-four page book is filled with rare and previously unseen images\n captured by Marshall's distinctive lens.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55d40b18c594b4d029e9105c4159c893d52f36cf","amp;dn":"Jimi_Hendrix-Hendrix_In_The_West-2011-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55d40b18c594b4d029e9105c4159c893d52f36cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,212,11,24,197,148,180,208,41,233,16,92,65,89,200,147,213,47,54,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
