Did BuddhaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teachings thrive because he was more attractive or charismatic than most, or because he was a great teacher and a tireless advocate of the poor? Or Ã¢â‚¬â€ and hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the core question weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll explore in detail Ã¢â‚¬â€ was it also because he was an enlightened being with profound insights into the nature of Reality, and because he possessed supernormal abilities? We might ask the same questions about Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Milarepa, or a host of other historically prominent figures associated with special illumination, wisdom, or grace. Did these people just sport great tans and know how to work a crowd, or did they understand something genuinely deep about the human condition, and our capacities, that are not yet within the purview of science?\n\nby Dean Radin, Chief Scientist, Institute of Noetic Sciences","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a251ac790c2977430cdac20d04cd03069682c11","amp;dn":"Supernormal+-+Dean+Radin+%5BePub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a251ac790c2977430cdac20d04cd03069682c11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,37,26,199,144,194,151,116,48,205,172,32,208,76,208,48,105,104,44,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
