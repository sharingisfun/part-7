The new album is downright impressive and fantastic, fitting in nicely alongside Turn Back The Clock, and the highly underrated &quot;Tall Stories&quot; album. It's book-marked by the strongest tracks: the upbeat, driving &quot;Magnetized&quot; (the first single which you can't get outta your head after hearing), and the extremely touching &quot;Eternal&quot;, which can literally leave you in tears. Great songs in between; this is really what a proper pop record should be. Guys, this is how you &quot;turn back the clock&quot;.\n\n\n1  Magnetized  \n2  Man With No Name  \n3  The Road Not Taken  \n4  You Belong To You  \n5  Release You  \n6  Nevermore  \n7  Ghost Of Love  \n8  Lighthouse  \n9  Goodbye Sweet Yesterday  \n10  Eternal  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55b6f6148493310589afcdddf2b896a6e7d4dc92","amp;dn":"Johnny+Hates+Jazz+-+Magnetized+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55b6f6148493310589afcdddf2b896a6e7d4dc92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,182,246,20,132,147,49,5,137,175,205,221,242,184,150,166,231,212,220,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
