Even if you know enough to be productive, there are a number of features that can take you to the next level in Python. Pro Python explores concepts and features normally left to experimentation, allowing you to be even more productive and creative.\n\nIn addition to pure code concerns, Pro Python will develop your programming techniques and approaches, which will help make you a better Python programmer. Not only will this book help your code, it will also help you understand and interact with the many established Python communities, or even start your own.\n\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n- Write strong Python code that will be respected in the Python community.\n- Understand the reasons behind big design decisions in Python.\n- Write programs that can reconfigure themselves in Python.\n- Disguise your code as different types of objects in Python.\n- Inspect just about any object in Python.\n- Prepare your code for international audiences.\n- Ensure code quality with rigorous testing.\n\nWho this book is for\nThis book is for intermediate to advanced Python programmers who are looking to understand how and why Python works the way it does and how they can take their code to the next level.\n\nAbout the Author\nMarty Alchin is a seasoned web developer, with prior work ranging from static content to highly dynamic web frameworks.
