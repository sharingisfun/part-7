Although there were a few speed bumps along the way in Springsteen's career, the wonder of his nearly unbroken string of critical and commercial success is that he achieved it while periodically challenging his listeners by going off in unexpected directions, following his muse even when that meant altering the sound of his music or the composition of his backup band, or making his lyrical message overtly political. Of course, it may have been these very sidesteps that kept his image and his music fresh, especially since he always had the fallback of returning to what his fans thought he did best, barnstorming the country with a marathon rock &amp; roll show using his longtime bandmates.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\n\n\n01.The Ghost Of Tom Joad\n02.Straight Time\n03.Highway 29\n04.Youngstown\n05.Sinaloa Cowboys\n06.The Line\n07.Balboa Park\n08.Dry Lightning\n09.The New Timer\n10.Across The Border\n11.Galveston Bay\n12.My Best Was Never Good Enough\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7cbf8b00849da8ac541210161f357c16c65e857","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen-The+Ghost+Of+Tom+Joad%5BCD+Rip%5Dvtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7cbf8b00849da8ac541210161f357c16c65e857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,203,248,176,8,73,218,138,197,65,33,1,97,243,87,193,108,101,232,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
