His importance resides in his contributions to both Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. Pissarro studied from great forerunners, including Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. He later studied and worked alongside Georges Seurat and Paul Signac when he took on the Neo-Impressionist style at the age of 54.\n\nIn 1873 he helped establish a collective society of fifteen aspiring artists, becoming the Ã¢â‚¬Å“pivotalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ figure in holding the group together and encouraging the other members. Art historian John Rewald called Pissarro the Ã¢â‚¬Å“dean of the Impressionist painters&quot;, not only because he was the oldest of the group, but also &quot;by virtue of his wisdom and his balanced, kind, and warmhearted personalityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. CÃƒÂ©zanne said &quot;he was a father for me. A man to consult and a little like the good Lord,&quot; and he was also one of Gauguin's masters. Renoir referred to his work as Ã¢â‚¬Å“revolutionaryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, through his artistic portrayals of the &quot;common man&quot;, as Pissarro insisted on painting individuals in natural settings without &quot;artifice or grandeur&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d32e85b825a3e3bd7c75f05e0a51406d410f8cb8","amp;dn":"Camille+Pissarro+1830+-+1903+%28Art+paintings+nrg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d32e85b825a3e3bd7c75f05e0a51406d410f8cb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,46,133,184,37,163,227,189,124,117,240,94,10,81,64,109,65,15,140,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
