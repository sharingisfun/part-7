We'll start off by learning about the Blueprint Editor interface and what blueprints can do for us. After that, we'll learn the basics by creating a simple Level Blueprint where we'll learn how to interact with objects in a specific level. \n\nThen we'll discover the Class Blueprints, which are an extremely helpful asset new to the Unreal Engine. These Class Blueprints are self contained objects with interactive properties that can be reused across all of your levels.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02d40fbd5c19c2ab372a97daa228e8e8fb49d525","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Blueprint+in+Unreal+Engine+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02d40fbd5c19c2ab372a97daa228e8e8fb49d525","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,212,15,189,92,25,194,171,55,42,151,218,162,40,232,232,251,73,213,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
