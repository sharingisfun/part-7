Responding to the concerns of both instructors and students, CLINICAL LABORATORY MATHEMATICS begins with a review of arithmetic and algebra. Next, it presents example-rich chapters on exponential notation and logarithms, rounding and figure significance, measurement systems, solutions and concentrations, dilutions, proportionality, graphs, rates of change, statistics, chemistry, quality control, and method evaluation. It answers frequently asked questions, identifies common misunderstandings, and offers an optional advanced section online. Throughout, the author explains why a solid understanding of math is critical in today's high-technology clinical laboratories. Practice problems are strategically designed to present real-world scenarios with both context and consequence. Supporting both self-guided study and traditional lecture-discussion, the text is logically organized and liberally cross-referenced, revealing hidden connections and common motifs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:861a19581c36650a296a0b57ba62e6d18cc46d7a","amp;dn":"Clinical+Laboratory+Mathematics-+Ball+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"861a19581c36650a296a0b57ba62e6d18cc46d7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,26,25,88,28,54,101,10,41,106,11,87,186,98,230,209,140,196,109,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
