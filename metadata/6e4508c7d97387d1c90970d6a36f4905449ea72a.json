Don't waste anything (not even the water leftover from those potatoes you just boiled)! Always work hard! This philosophy meant that when Thelma's daughter Monica founded Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day products (named after her mom), the products were designed to work hard for you.\n\n Now for the first time, Thelma's sage advice is being made available in this revolutionary cleaning guide chock full of practical tips and secrets based on the premise that life is hectic and messy -- and so keeping your house clean and nice is the only sensible thing to do. With shortcuts and tips for cleaning the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and living room, MRS MEYER'S CLEAN HOME contains unexpected advice such as:\n --Never use vinegar and water on wood floors. One part dish soap and four parts water is the only way to truly get them clean. And remember to buff with a terrycloth towel.\n\n --Always clean out the fridge before grocery shopping. Serve the kids &quot;Musko&quot; (&quot;must go&quot;) for dinner, using the items that were fast approaching expiration.\n --Wash windows on a cloudy day to avoid the nasty streaking that happens when the sun's out and glass dry too fast.\n\n MRS MEYER'S CLEAN HOME is two parts common sense and one part inspiration. Read it and learn how to clean like the dickens.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e4508c7d97387d1c90970d6a36f4905449ea72a","amp;dn":"Mrs.+Meyer%27s+Clean+Home%3A+No+Nonsense+Advice+That+Will+Inspire+Yo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e4508c7d97387d1c90970d6a36f4905449ea72a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,69,8,199,217,115,135,209,201,9,112,214,163,111,73,5,68,158,167,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
