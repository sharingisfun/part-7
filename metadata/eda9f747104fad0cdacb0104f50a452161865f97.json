Additionally, for the first time ever, a little-known 10kHz midrange band discovered in the original 1073 schematics but operable only on the rare 1078 channel strip has been modeled and incorporated into the plugin. And to top it all off, the Waves MS matrix has been added to let you apply different equalization to mid and side stereo content.\n\nUsing innovative procedures to model the acclaimed Marinair transformer, Waves has meticulously captured all the sonic characteristics of the 1073, including its harmonic distortion. These overtones were tweaked to perfection by Andrew Scheps himself, resulting in beautiful and authentic saturations.\n\nWhether used for recording, mixing or mastering, Scheps 73 lets you enjoy all the warm tones of a fabled piece of studio hardware, in-the-box!\n\nDeveloped in association with world-renowned mixing engineer Andrew Scheps.\nBased on the classic 1073.\nHigh, mid and low interrelated bands and a high-pass filter.\nBeautiful saturations and harmonic distortion.\nExclusive 1078 / 10kHz midrange band.\nMS matrix: Apply different EQ to mid and side stereo content.\n\nRequeriment:\nWaves 9r14.\nAdd to plugins folder.\n\nMacintosh HD /Users/Applications/Waves/Waves Plug-Ins/\n\nRun Waves AU Reg Utility 9.2\n\nMacintosh HD /Users/Applications/Waves/Waveshells/\n\nEnjoy!\n\ndada.\n\nMMXIV.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eda9f747104fad0cdacb0104f50a452161865f97","amp;dn":"Waves+-+Scheps+73+-+OS+X+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eda9f747104fad0cdacb0104f50a452161865f97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,169,247,71,16,79,173,12,218,203,1,4,245,10,69,33,97,134,95,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
