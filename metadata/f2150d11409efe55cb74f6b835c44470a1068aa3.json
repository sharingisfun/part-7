Starting with basic mechanics, the book goes on to cover modern numerical techniques such as matrix and finite element methods. There is also additional material on composite materials, thick shells, flat plates and the vibrations of complex structures. Illustrated throughout with worked examples, the book also provides numerous problems for students to attempt.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2150d11409efe55cb74f6b835c44470a1068aa3","amp;dn":"Strength+of+Materials+and+Structures+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2150d11409efe55cb74f6b835c44470a1068aa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,21,13,17,64,158,254,85,203,116,246,184,53,196,68,112,161,6,138,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
