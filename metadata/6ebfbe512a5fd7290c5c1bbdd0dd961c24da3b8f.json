Training System featuring Bill Wolfe offers a fundamental yet comprehensive foundation in Close Quarter Battle for the street presented in the most time effective instructional format anywhere.\n\nThe system of Modern Defendo is a cutting edge extension of William Fairbairn&amp;#039;s original system first developed for Police use, and later adapted for military applications. A key principal in training for Fairbairn, was that of evolution. And in that same spirit, Modern Defendo reflects an evolution and modernization of the system to address real world violence as it occurs today. As the fundamental principals of what Fairbairn first developed still hold true more than 70 years later, the system of Modern Defendo has not &quot;recreated the wheel&quot;, but rather given it a modern edge using the same scientific research methods and real world battle testing. \n\nSee www.defendo.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ebfbe512a5fd7290c5c1bbdd0dd961c24da3b8f","amp;dn":"DEFENDO+CQB%2C+the+C.O.R.E.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ebfbe512a5fd7290c5c1bbdd0dd961c24da3b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,191,190,81,42,95,215,41,12,92,27,189,208,221,150,28,36,218,59,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
