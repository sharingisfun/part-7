In 1989, she released her eponymous debut album. In 1990, &quot;Black Velvet&quot;, a single from that album, was a worldwide hit[1] and won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female.\n\n\nWhen she was eighteen, she began performing in Southern Ontario. She eventually met Christopher Ward, the songwriter who helped her to form her own band, and performed cover versions of Aretha Franklin, T. Rex, AC/DC, Bob Seger, Anne Peebles, the Rolling Stones, and the Pretenders. Later, she joined David Tyson to produce her self-titled debut album, Alannah Myles. She appeared together with Ward in a 1984 installment of the television series program The Kids Of Degrassi Street, in which she played the role of an aspiring singer and single mother.\n\nIn 1989, she released Alannah Myles. It produced three Top 40 selections, &quot;Love Is&quot;, &quot;Lover Of Mine&quot;, and &quot;Still Got This Thing&quot;, as well as the number-one hit &quot;Black Velvet&quot;. For Myles, &quot;Black Velvet&quot; became a number one hit worldwide and was named the most played song on radio for 1989. By 2,000 it had received the Ascap Millionaire Award for having received over 5 million airplays at radio.[citation needed] &quot;Black Velvet&quot; won Myles a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Performance in 1991, and several Juno Awards.[3]\n\nThe year 1992 brought the follow-up album, Rockinghorse, which included the hit singles &quot;Song Instead Of A Kiss&quot; written by Alannah Myles, Nancy Simmonds and Canadian poet Robert Priest,[4] &quot;Our World, Our Times&quot;, and &quot;Sonny, Say You Will&quot;. She received a Grammy nomination for &quot;Rockinghorse&quot; and three Juno Awards.\n\nThe year 1995 brought A-lan-nah, a lesser-known album which contained no Top 40 singles, though it included two tracks which made it into the Top 100: &quot;Family Secret&quot; and &quot;Blow Wind, Blow&quot;.\n\nIn 1997 she left her eight-record contract with the Atlantic Records label at the behest of her manager, Miles Copeland, who signed her to his Ark 21 Records. There she released A Rival, which had the Top 40 hit &quot;Bad 4 You&quot;, written and recorded by Myles, Desmond Child and Eric Bazilian at Copeland's castle songwriting retreat at Grand Brassac, France.\n\nIn February 2005, together with the Swedish band Kee Marcello's K2, she participated in the third semi-final of Melodifestivalen, the Swedish national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. Their song &quot;We Got It All&quot; scored very few points and finished seventh out of eight songs yet managed to dominate the leading newspaper and media headlines in Sweden.[5]\n\nIn July 2008, Myles, in an interview with the CBC's Evan Solomon, discussed her upcoming album Black Velvet, which featured a new recording of her song of the same name in addition to ten new songs. Black Velvet was released in April 2008 in Canada and Europe.She is a practicing sufi in Qadiri lineage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlannah Myles 1989\n\n\nAlannah Myles was the self-titled debut album released by Alannah Myles on January 1, 1989.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Still Got This Thing&quot; (Christopher Ward) - (4:37)\n2.\t&quot;Love Is&quot; (Ward, David Tyson) - (3:40)\n3.\t&quot;Black Velvet&quot; (Ward, Tyson) - (4:47)\n4.\t&quot;Rock This Joint&quot; (Ward) - (4:02)\n5.\t&quot;Lover Of Mine&quot; (Myles, Ward, Tyson, Kit Johnson) - (4:42)\n6.\t&quot;Kick Start My Heart&quot; (Ward, Shirley Eikhard, Madeline Stone, Chris Waters) - (3:42)\n7.\t&quot;If You Want To&quot; (Ward, Tyson) - (4:13)\n8.\t&quot;Just One Kiss&quot; (Ward, Tyson) - (3:35)\n9.\t&quot;Who Loves You&quot; (Ward, Tyson) - (3:37)\n10.\t&quot;Hurry Make Love&quot; (Nancy Simmonds) - (2:16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRockinghorse 1992\n\n\nRockinghorse is the second album released by Alannah Myles in 1992.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Our World Our Times&quot; (Christopher Ward, David Tyson) - (6:24)\n2.\t&quot;Make Me Happy&quot; (Ward, Tyson) - (5:49)\n3.\t&quot;Sonny Say You Will&quot; (Ward) - (5:07)\n4.\t&quot;Tumbleweed&quot; (Ward) - (4:38)\n5.\t&quot;Livin' On A Memory&quot; (Ward, Tyson) - (5:52)\n6.\t&quot;Song Instead Of A Kiss&quot; (Myles, Nancy Simmonds, Robert Priest) - (5:05)\n7.\t&quot;Love In The Big Town&quot; (Ward, Tyson) - (4:47)\n8.\t&quot;The Last Time I Saw William&quot; (Myles, Ward, Tyson) - (4:14)\n9.\t&quot;Lies And Rumours&quot; (Ward, Tyson) - (5:06)\n10.\t&quot;Rockinghorse&quot; (Myles, Ward, Simmonds) - (3:01)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-lan-nah 1995\n\n\nA-lan-nah is the third album released by Alannah Myles, in 1995.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\tMistress of Erzulie   (Myles, Phil Johnstone) - (4.48)\n2.\tBlow Wind Blow   (Myles, Christopher Ward) - (4.18)\n3.\tFamily Secret   (Ward, David Tyson) - (5.19)\n4.\tMother Nature   (Myles, Johnstone, Kurt Schefter) - (4.04)\n5.\tIrish Rain   (Ward) - (4.23)\n6.\tDark Side of Me   (Myles, Pat MacDonald, Rich Wayland) - (3.43)\n7.\tSimple Man's Dream   (Myles, Gary Nicholson, Kevin Savigar) - (4.31)\n8.\tLightning in a Bottle   (Myles, Ward, Tyson) - (4.32)\n9.\tKeeper of My Heart   (Myles, Johnstone, Schefter) - (3.57)\n10.\tDo You Really Want to Know Me   (Myles, Nancy Simmonds, Cyril Rawson) - (2.34)\n11.\tEverybody's Breaking Up   (MacDonald) - (4.39)\n12.\tSally, Go 'Round the Roses   (Zell Sanders, Phil Spector) - (2.49)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArival 1998\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nMotherload\nBad 4 You\nDance of Love\nThe Great Divide\nChained (Final Rescue)\nWhy Have Angels Denied You\nWhat Am I Gonna Do With You\nEverything Missing\nKisses are Weapons\nHonesty\nYellow Rose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Velvet 2008\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nBlack Velvet\nComment Ca Va\nPrime of my Life\nOnly Wings\nLeave it Alone\nAnywhere But Home\nFaces in the Crowd\nGive me Love\nWhat is Love\nI Love You\nTrouble\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Very Best Of 1999\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\nBlack Velvet\nBreak The Silence\nEverybody's Breaking Up\nLove Is\nSong Instead of a Kiss\nSonny Say You Will\nBad 4 You\nOur World Our Times\nLong Long Time\nFamily Secret\nLover of Mine\nStill Got This Thing\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy Alannah Myles :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddafec74fb53a246bea2f9c5dfff1de72413a6d3","amp;dn":"Alannah+Myles+-+Discography+1989+-+2008+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddafec74fb53a246bea2f9c5dfff1de72413a6d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,175,236,116,251,83,162,70,190,162,249,197,223,255,29,231,36,19,166,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
