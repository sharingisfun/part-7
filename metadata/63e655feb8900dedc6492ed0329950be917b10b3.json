Star Trek, Star Wars, Gerry Anderson's series, Aliens, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, and many others. No book can cover everything or every scifi movie and TV show ever made, but it does touch on the ones that were breakthroughs in how scifi was shown, and of course, the book is stocked full of color images of various space ships and gear.\n\nCONTENTS\n06 1900s-1950s\n22 Gerry Anderson\n24 2001: A Space Odyssey\n26 Star Trek\n41 Gene Roddenberry\n42 UFO\n44 Space 1999\n46 Aliens\n52 Red Dwarf\n54 The Space Shuttle\n56 Industrial Light and Magic\n58 Star Wars\n74 BlakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 7\n75 Teleportation\n76 Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\n78 Sunshine\n80 Motherships\n82 The HitchhikerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide to the Galaxy\n83 Ron Thornton\n84 Babylon 5\n86 Galaxy Quest\n88 Independence Day\n90 Space Travel\n94 Event Horizon\n95 Outland\n96 Space: Above and Beyond\n98 Battlestar Galactica\n104 Weapons\n107 Firefly\n108 Models\n110 Fact and Fiction\n113 Not just a spaceship...\n114 Index","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63e655feb8900dedc6492ed0329950be917b10b3","amp;dn":"Spaceships+Of+Science+Fiction+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63e655feb8900dedc6492ed0329950be917b10b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,230,85,254,184,144,13,237,198,73,46,208,50,153,80,190,145,123,16,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
