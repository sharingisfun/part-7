It was developed by studio Ubisoft Sofia in cooperation with UbisoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teams in Singapore, Montreal, Quebec, Chengdu, Milan and Bucharest.\nAction takes place in the middle of 18th century, during The Seven YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s War. We play as Shay Patrick Cormac Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a Templar who once belonged to Assassin Brotherhood but started hunting for his former Ã¢â‚¬Å“brothersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ after he was betrayed. With progression of the story, we are visiting three major regions: New York, Appalachian Mountains and north waters of Atlantic Ocean. The game is final part of the KenwaysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ story told previously by AssassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Creed III and AssassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Creed IV: Black Flag.\nThe gameplay of AssassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Creed: Rogue doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have many differences in comparison with previous games of the series. We are completing main and side missions with using protagonistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unusal skills to climb on buildings and fight. But our enemies have now wider moveset Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they are Assassins so they can perform air attacks or use surrounding to hide, among other things. Similarly to AssassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Creed IV: Black Flag, the game offers also naval gameplay. Our ship is now Morrigan which is faster than Edward KenwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jackdaw and has more advanced armament (especially the Puckle gun).\nAssassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Creed: Rogue doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t offer the multiplayer mode which was present in each game in the series since AssassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Creed: Brotherhood (2010). The graphics is on the same level as in previous installment for seventh generation consoles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ AssassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Creed IV: Black Flag","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3905d2078e5fddd836167a8c2ccde42bbd9d39d5","amp;dn":"Assassin%27s+Creed+Rogue+%5BPC%5D-Cracked+Game-SKIDROW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3905d2078e5fddd836167a8c2ccde42bbd9d39d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,5,210,7,142,95,221,216,54,22,122,140,44,205,228,43,189,157,57,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
