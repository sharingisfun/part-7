The major emphasis is on basic principles and problem formulation. Strong effort has been made to show both the cohesiveness of the relatively few fundamental ideas and the great variety of problems that these ideas solve. All of the problems deal with principles and procedures inherent in the design and analysis of engineering structures and mechanical systems with many of the problems referring explicitly to design considerations.\n\nFrom the Publisher\nFeatures over 2,500 problems, of which 50% are new to this edition alone. The well-structured pedagogy includes boxed material; clear identification of introductory, computer and difficult problems; and a strong emphasis on graphical analysis.\n\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 736 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 5 edition (December 31, 2001)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9780471406457\nISBN-13: 978-0471406457\nASIN: 0471406457\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:122f639528097c4dbcc80935e5a0a031868a3220","amp;dn":"Solution+Manual+-+Engineering+Mechanics+Dynamics+5th+Edition+Mer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"122f639528097c4dbcc80935e5a0a031868a3220","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,47,99,149,40,9,124,77,188,200,9,53,229,160,160,49,134,138,50,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
