Largely on the strength of their albums Pyromania and Hysteria, Def Leppard became one of the top-selling rock bands throughout the 1980s, selling over 65 million albums worldwide,[3] including over 35 million in the United States alone. Def Leppard are ranked #31 on VH1's &quot;Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.\n\n\nRick Savage (bass), Pete Willis (guitar), and Tony Kenning (drums), all students at Tapton School in Sheffield, formed a band called Atomic Mass in 1977. Following a chance meeting with Willis after missing a bus, 18-year old Joe Elliott tried out for the band as a guitarist. During his audition, however, it was decided that he was better suited to be the lead singer.\n\nSoon afterward they adopted a name proposed by Elliott, &quot;Deaf Leopard&quot;, which was originally a band name he thought up while writing reviews for imaginary rock bands in his English class [5] At Kenning's suggestion, the spelling was slightly modified in order to make the name seem less like that of a punk band.\n\nIn November, just prior to recording sessions for what would be a three-song release known as the Def Leppard EP, Kenning abruptly left the band. He was replaced for those sessions by Frank Noon. By the end of the month Rick Allen, then only 15 years old, had joined the band as its full-time drummer.\n\nSales of the EP soared after the track &quot;Getcha Rocks Off&quot; was given extensive airtime by renowned BBC Radio DJ John Peel, considered at the time to be a champion of punk rock and new wave music.\n\nThroughout 1979, the band developed a loyal following among British hard rock/heavy metal fans and were even initially considered the leaders of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (a status eventually claimed by Iron Maiden). Their growing popularity led to a record deal with the major label Phonogram/Vertigo (Mercury Records in the US).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Definitive Collection 2005\n\n\nRock of Ages: The Definitive Collection is the American version of the first compilation by British rock band Def Leppard. The 2-Disc anthology featuring 35 hit songs by the band and was released in America on May 17, 2005. Its Worldwide release Best of, has a slightly different track listing, different artwork, different &quot;previously unreleased&quot; song and was released on October 25, 2004. This is the only Def Leppard hits compilation (to date) that features the full-length version of &quot;Bringin' on the Heartbreak&quot; that fades into the Switch 625 instrumental.\n\nOriginally released for the U.S. only, Rock of Ages is due for release in Europe on January 28th 2008.\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n1.\t&quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me (Historia Video Edit)&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Photograph&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Love Bites&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Let's Get Rocked&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Two Steps Behind (Acoustic Version)&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Animal&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Heaven Is&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Foolin'&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Rocket (Visualize Video Edit)&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;When Love &amp; Hate Collide&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Armageddon It&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Rock of Ages&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Hysteria&quot;  \n15.\t&quot;Miss You in a Heartbeat&quot;  \n16.\t&quot;Bringin' on the Heartbreak&quot;  \n17.\t&quot;Switch 625&quot;  \n\n\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\t\n1.\t&quot;Rock!
