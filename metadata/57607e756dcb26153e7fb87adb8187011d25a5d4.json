The smart people who understood what was or might be happening were paralyzed by hope and fear; in any case, they weren't talking. \n\n Michael Lewis creates a fresh, character-driven narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor, a fitting sequel to his #1 bestseller Liar's Poker. Out of a handful of unlikely--really unlikely--heroes, Lewis fashions a story as compelling and unusual as any of his earlier bestsellers, proving yet again that he is the finest and funniest chronicler of our time. \n\n The #1 New York Times bestseller: &quot;It is the work of our greatest financial journalist, at the top of his game. And it's essential reading.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Graydon Carter, Vanity Fair","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57607e756dcb26153e7fb87adb8187011d25a5d4","amp;dn":"The+Big+Short%3A+Inside+the+Doomsday+Machine+-+Michael+Lewis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57607e756dcb26153e7fb87adb8187011d25a5d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,96,126,117,109,203,38,21,62,127,184,122,219,129,135,1,29,37,165,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
