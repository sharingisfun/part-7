Next, near the top of the program, click the &quot;Tables&quot; button. \nAfterward, the &quot;Install&quot; button. Then, simply navigate to the folder containing the table(s) you would like to use.\n\nEach folder has a ReadMe explaining the corresponding Character Set.\n\nLM hash tables (For XP LM hashes only):\n\tXP_free_small\t(formerly known as SSTIC04-10k)\n\t\tCharset: 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n\n\tXP_free_fast\t(formerly known as SSTIC04-5k)\n\t\tCharset: 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n\n\tXP_special\t\t(formerly known as WS-20k)\n\t\tCharset:\t0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n\t\t\t\t!&quot;#$%&amp;&amp;#039;()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[]^_`{|}~ (including the space character)\n\nNT hash tables (For XP and Vista NT hashes only):\n\tVista_free\n\t\tCharset: based on a dictionary with variations (hybrid mode)\n\n\tVista_special\t(formerly known as NTHASH)\n\t\tPasswords of length 6 or less\n\t\t\tCharset:\t0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n  \t\t\t\t\t!&quot;#$%&amp;&amp;#039;()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[]^_`{|}~ (including the space character)\n\t\tPasswords of length 7\n\t\t\tCharset: 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n\t\tPasswords of length 8\n\t\t\tCharset: 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n\nNotes:\n\tI did not include the program since it is constantly updating, no reason to use an outdated version.\n\tSorry for the RAR format, it is saving 2gb in the torrent size however! You can just download the tables you need.\n\tThe tables XP_free_small and XP_free_fast are the same table. XP_fast is simply larger and thus less compressed, \nmaking it faster.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48d907e7ea7fa7b25dddc74b6bac4986230f8662","amp;dn":"Ophcrack+-+Collection+of+5+Tables","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48d907e7ea7fa7b25dddc74b6bac4986230f8662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,217,7,231,234,127,167,178,93,221,199,75,107,172,73,134,35,15,134,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
