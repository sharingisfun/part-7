Leadership Ã¢â‚¬Å“toolsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are usually defined as computers, spreadsheets, data, and even experience, but in reality, leaders need thinking tools that are hard to come by, so they find themselves hunting and pecking for answers in books, at seminars, through on-the-job training programs, from mentors, and at business schools, and still, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re left with gaps. Surely, most leaders are good at what they do, but the daily challenges of their jobs, like accelerating growth, increasing productivity, driving innovation, doing more with less, and balancing work with life donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come with some sort of leadership toolkit...until now.\n\nIn Paid to Think, international consultant David Goldsmith presents his groundbreaking approach to leadership and management based on research revealing the twelve specific activities that all leaders perform on a daily basis, and he provides you with each activityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accompanying tools and instructions proven to boost your performance and that of your entire organization.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:918cac36c8286f99d117ecafb49819ab0f860ff2","amp;dn":"Paid+to+Think%3A+A+Leader%27s+Toolkit+for+Redefining+Your+Future","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"918cac36c8286f99d117ecafb49819ab0f860ff2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,140,172,54,200,40,111,153,209,23,236,175,180,152,25,171,15,134,15,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
