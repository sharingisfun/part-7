Their parents, Bob and Lisa, were active in the thriving Kansas City Blues scene, playing in local bands and competing in the Kansas City Blues Challenge. Bob and LisaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s band didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make it to the International Blues Challenge in Memphis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but their kids did. When TUF arrived in Memphis for the 2008 IBC they were followed by huge, wildly enthusiastic throngs of hometown supporters, eager to cheer for their favorite musical family. And when TUF took First Place in the competition and Nick won the Albert King award for best guitarist, it was a sweet victory for the Schnebelen family and for Kansas City itself. TUF has been on a roll ever since, becoming popular repeat headliners at clubs, festivals and cruises around the world and releasing CDs and a DVD on their own label.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tBlues\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Get It Straight\n02.Bad Woman Blues\n03.Wrong Side Of The Blues\n04.She's Long, She's Tall, She's Gone\n05.Goodbye\n06.Heart On The Line\n07.The Fool\n08.Have A Real Good Time\n09.Just Tell Yourself\n10.Evil Train\n11.It Would Be Nice\n12.The Better Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98f1729575ce96678b3e3e1f4425e97753f9534b","amp;dn":"Trampled+Under+Foot+-+Wrong+Side+Of+The+Blues+%282011%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98f1729575ce96678b3e3e1f4425e97753f9534b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,241,114,149,117,206,150,103,139,62,62,31,68,37,233,119,83,249,83,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
