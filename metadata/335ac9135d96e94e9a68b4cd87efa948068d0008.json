In this new edition, the author has expanded the section on debug to include avoiding common hardware, software and interrupt problems. Other new features include an expanded section on system integration and debug to address the capabilities of more recent emulators and debuggers, a section about combination microcontroller/PLD devices, and expanded information on industry standard embedded platforms. \n\n* Covers all 'species' of embedded system chips rather than specific hardware\n\n* Learn how to cope with 'real world' problems\n\n* Design embedded systems products that are reliable and work in real applications\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:335ac9135d96e94e9a68b4cd87efa948068d0008","amp;dn":"Embedded+Microprocessor+Systems+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"335ac9135d96e94e9a68b4cd87efa948068d0008","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,90,201,19,93,150,233,78,154,104,180,205,135,239,169,72,6,141,0,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
