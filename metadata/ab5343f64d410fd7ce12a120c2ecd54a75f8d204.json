Tracy plays Warren Haggerty, the managing editor of a newspaper that mistakenly prints a story declaring the rich Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy) has stolen away another woman's husband. Connie retaliates by suing the paper for $5 million. This happens right before Warren is about to marry his fiancee Gladys (Jean Harlow). As he has done several times in the past, Warren delays the wedding in order to stop the libel suit. Warren hires Bill Chandler (William Powell), a former employer who is desperate for a job, to marry Gladys in name only and then court Connie. That way, Gladys can sue Connie for alienation of affections and get Connie to agree to drop her lawsuit if Gladys will drop hers. Bill hops an ocean liner to accompany Connie and her father (Walter Connolly) back to the United States, but along the way Bill and Connie fall in love and Bill tries to convince Gladys to drop her suit so it won't hinder his relationship with Connie.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027884/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027884/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-27884/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-27884/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector: Jack Conway\n\n\n\n\n\tJean Harlow\t... \tGladys\n\n\tWilliam Powell\t... \tBill Chandler\n\n\tMyrna Loy\t... \tConnie Allenbury\n\n\tSpencer Tracy\t... \tHaggerty\n\tWalter Connolly\t... \tMr. Allenbury\n\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:38:15\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x480  1.50:1\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1213 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,12 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab5343f64d410fd7ce12a120c2ecd54a75f8d204","amp;dn":"Libeled+Lady+%281936%29+Jean+Harlow+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab5343f64d410fd7ce12a120c2ecd54a75f8d204","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,83,67,246,77,65,15,215,206,18,161,32,194,236,213,74,117,248,210,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
