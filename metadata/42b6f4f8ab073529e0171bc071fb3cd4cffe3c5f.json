The project took root in 2007, when the two began composing songs to accompany one of Lindhome's short films, Imaginary Larry. Both actresses proved to be fairly adept musicians -- Lindhome (aka &quot;Garfunkel&quot;) played guitar, while Micucci (aka &quot;Oates&quot;) had studied classical piano as a child -- and the resulting music was light, melodic, and humorous. The two continued writing songs after completing the Imaginary Larry project, touching upon such time-honored subjects as the arrogance of pregnant women and the mating habits of ducks in the process. Their visibility increased when &quot;Fuck You&quot; was featured in an episode of Scrubs (albeit with a revised, expletive-free refrain) in February 2009, and they issued their first recording, Music Songs, later that year. ~ Andrew Leahey\n\n\nTrack List:\n01 Overture\n02 Garfunkel and Oates Time\n03 Self Esteem\n04 29 _ 31\n05 Sports Go Sports\n06 The Loophole\n07 Fadeaway\n08 Such a Loser\n09 Frozen Lullaby\n10 The College Try\n11 What Song Is Next_\n12 Happy Birthday to My Loose Acquai\n13 The BJ Song\n14 Sad Montage\n15 You Go First\n16 Rainbow Connections\n17 I Get to Do It With You","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42b6f4f8ab073529e0171bc071fb3cd4cffe3c5f","amp;dn":"Garfunkel+and+Oates+-+Secretions+AAC+256","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42b6f4f8ab073529e0171bc071fb3cd4cffe3c5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,182,244,248,171,7,53,41,224,23,27,192,113,251,60,212,207,254,60,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
