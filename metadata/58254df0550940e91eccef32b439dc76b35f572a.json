The 30-minute total body routine can sculpt even the deepest muscles in a short amount of time by emphasizing the quality of repetitions, not the quantity. This fluid routine incorporates all muscle groups to produce a slimmer, stronger, and more toned body. The bonus 10-minute ab session provides extra focused work to help achieve a firm, flat midsection. These two programs are specifically designed to deliver accelerated results. Together they will stretch, strengthen and sculpt the whole body while improving balance, posture and flexibility.\n\nVideo; x264; 720*480 (16:9); 1744 kbps; 23.976 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58254df0550940e91eccef32b439dc76b35f572a","amp;dn":"Accelerated+Pilates+with+Resistance+Band+with+Lisa+Hubbard+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58254df0550940e91eccef32b439dc76b35f572a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,37,77,240,85,9,64,233,30,204,239,50,180,57,220,118,179,95,87,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
