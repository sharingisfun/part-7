She wheedles favours out of him, eventually becoming a superstar, while the deformed Snyder becomes increasingly frustrated and violent.\n\nThis is Doris Day's best performance by far, and you may be surprised at how sexy she is - in a blowzy, slinky way qite unlike her usual clean-cut image. The musical numbers are great, especially Ten Cents a Dance - you get a real feel for twenties-thirties music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dda48817d11bdb9c5825cfc74b42ea621c13174","amp;dn":"Love+Me+or+Leave+Me+%281955%29+Doris+Day+James+Cagney","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dda48817d11bdb9c5825cfc74b42ea621c13174","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,218,72,129,125,17,189,185,197,130,92,252,116,180,46,166,33,193,49,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
