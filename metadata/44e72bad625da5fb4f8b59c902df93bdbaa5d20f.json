Hailing from Florida and featuring John Tardy (vocals), brother Donald Tardy (drums), Trevor Peres (guitar), Allen West (guitar), and Daniel Tucker (bass), the band signed to Roadracer Records, a now defunct division of Roadrunner, for the recording of their debut albumÃ¢â‚¬â€the immense and immeasurably heavy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Slowly We RotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1989). The album was engineered by the legendary Scott Burns at Morrisound Studio, which would come to be the most sought after facility for production of albums during 1990Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s rise of the Death Metal genre. Unlike much death metal preceding it, the album had a sludgy feel and integrated devastatingly slow passages along with obliterating overtures that reached far beyond any point of mayhem that metal had yet to reach; the result was a carnal pleasure for doom, death and thrash fans alike coupling the adrenaline of a speedball with the slow, degrading measures of a sewer at dusk. Like them or not, Obituary was unlike anything anyone had heard before.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Slowly We RotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was chaotic, bass heavy mix of manic guitar solos and crashing drums, but it was undeniably characterized by vocalist John TardyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disarmingly horrific, gargling style, that created guttural chasms of dread which though often strived for, to date have been paralleled by none. The ability to augment tempo so drastically became the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark along with TardyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique vocal style, which distinguished them clearly from the rest of the emerging Florida Death Metal bands; nowhere is this more apparent than on the prophetic title track of their debut. The fact that Obituary refrained from printing lyric sheets with their albums led people to believe that they didn't actually write any lyrics. Some may question the verbosity or absence of documented lyrics, however, any true fan has each grunt, growl and howling grimace committed to memory like an utterance from God in painstaking formÃ¢â‚¬â€what does not exist can not be remembered, and an Obituary show is testimony to the re-creation of what your ears couldn't believe in the first place. Once again bringing augmentation to irony, Live and Dead worked quite well for the quintet, dividing your conscience yet leaving much to the imagination; not since birth have your senses been so graphically assaulted yet pleased at the same time. While such differing sensations once seemed incongruous, Obituary have proven the ability to merge unlikely dichotomies, from their slow-as-hell-yet-fast-as-fuck style to the non-evil, homegrown approach to what would largely become the satanized, bastardized, make-up wearing movement known as Death Metal.\n\nThe maturation of the musicians into songwriters taking more visionary and complex forms would soon be heard world wide as Obituary took metal by storm in 1990. Despite their youth upon release of their sophomore offering, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cause of DeathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ embodied the confident swagger of the most fearsome pack-leading hound. From the insidious growls of JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals to the barrage of Donald TardyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thunderously-metered explosions of double bass, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cause of DeathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was the intention and method as promised by the early threat of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Slowly We RotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; for Obituary, Death was just the beginning. Accordingly, the title track alone (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cause of DeathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) would be heard, regurgitated, manipulated, complimented and collapsedÃ¢â‚¬â€but never duplicatedÃ¢â‚¬â€on third and forth generation death metal albums for years to come. Lovecraftian imagery and aural morbidity aside, even a deaf man found fear when confronted by the formidable visage of guitarist Peres; entering Frank Watkins, the hulking henchman of a bassist from South Florida, finally provided long-needed and powerful rhythm stability to the line up. However, the grinding of the axes would not be complete until the return of Xecutioner veteran Allen West, who, along with Peres and Tardy, crafted the foundation for most of ObituaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most primordial and historic moments. Attack now whole, Obituary had given birthÃ¢â‚¬â€sight, sound and feelÃ¢â‚¬â€to a true horror greater than metal had ever known.\n\nThe paradox herein lies that Obituary was anything but a summation to and end, but more an exploratory journey into the infinite dehumanization of all that is known, as confronted brazenly by their best selling release yet, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The End CompleteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and later followed by the cynical and dark expedition of Ã¢â‚¬Å“World DemiseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Reunited with songwriter West, the band was conjoined like quintuplets sharing life and a name. Though finality was possibly inferred by these titles, Obituary was anything but finished. Ironically, the images conjured by songs such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t CareÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Platonic DiseaseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“World DemiseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ seemingly foretold of the millennium as can now be seen daily, displayed plainly across the screens of CNN and reality TV programs world wide; not bad for a bunch of rednecks from Florida with Budweiser dreams and bongwater nightmares.\n\n2004 brings reason for Obituary fans to rejoice, the sunken eyes and heaving cries have all but abated. Obituary has only aspired to live up to the standard they have set for themselves, one that numerous bands have strived to duplicate, but never attained, falling short both creatively and in lack of the unique talent that each member contributes to the near indescribable Obituary sound. Like a forgotten corpse in the basement, Obituary are back to haunt, taunt and fully pollute your senses. Fermenting like waste in the hot Florida sun, Obituary return from hiatus with the voracity of a starven wretch. The forfeiture of time brings blessings of brutality, and assurance that the Dead shall indeed rise again. Such aural abrasion can only be heard on an Obituary album or the live circumcision of a thirty-year-old man, the choice is yours...\n\n\nGenre:\tDeath\nBitrate:\tWebrip\nSize:\t95.34 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n14 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44e72bad625da5fb4f8b59c902df93bdbaa5d20f","amp;dn":"Obituary+-+Inked+In+Blood+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44e72bad625da5fb4f8b59c902df93bdbaa5d20f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,231,43,173,98,93,165,251,79,139,89,201,2,223,147,189,186,165,210,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
