In the third film (after Silentium and Komm, suesser Tod) laconic private eye Simon Brenner (Josef Hader) has to solve a case of murder, prostitution, eastern european gangsters, blackmail, missing persons, fried chickens and a sinister bone-grinding machine. And love, because it was love that started everything.\n\nJust like BrennerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s latest case, the film is mixed of lots of tasty ingredients ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ suspense, violence, gore, love, a faithful depiction of Austria and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rural population, romance and lots of black humor.\n\nOne awaits a crime thriller that closely follows the book by Wolf Haas and has many intelligent gags but the the viewer is then overwhelmed by a great masterpiece that works on many levels - a sarcastic thriller, dark humour, amazing photography that reveals some Austrian reality, an intelligent plot with cool twists, great acting, ironic social criticism etc.\n\nThis movie is in a row with the Kottan series, Indien, the other Brenner-movies of course, Slumming etc. and reassures one that although Qualtinger is dead his humour is not gone. When viewing this film one gets almost sad by realizing how good Austrian cinema can be, but there is not much support for filmmakers in Austria.\n\nUnfortunately, an international distribution seems unlikely (and the question remains if and how the movie would work when dubbed in a foreign language). Which is a pity, because Der Knochenmann is AustriaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s response to the Coen Brothers Fargo.
