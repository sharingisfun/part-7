Instead of trying to compete with the film's intense visuals with a musically busy score or pop songs, the largely tango and classical-inspired score provides a subtle backdrop to Waking Life's beautiful animation. That's not to say, however, that the film's music isn't just as creative in it's own right. Gill's score is fluid and ever-changing; pieces like &quot;Pelo Negro&quot; change from tense to brooding to sensual and back again at a moment's notice, reflecting the film's surreal, dreamlike nature. &quot;La Cosa Pequena&quot;'s winding melody, the lively, mischievous &quot;El Cholulo&quot; and &quot;Super Sport,&quot; and dramatic &quot;Ballade 4, Part 1&quot; are a few of the highlights from this creatively imagined and performed score. ~ Heather Phares\n\nOriginal score composed by Glover Gill.\n\nPerformedby Tosca Tango Orchestra.\n\n&quot;Classically Inspired With A Tango Edge&quot;;Tosca\n\n\nTracklist:\n1 \tTosca Tango Orchestra  -  \tBallade 4 Part 1 \t\t\n\n2 \tTosca Tango Orchestra  -  \tMi Otra Mitad De Naranja \t\t\n\n3 \tTosca Tango Orchestra  -  \tPelo Negro \t\t\n\n4 \tTosca Tango Orchestra  -  \tLa Cosa PequeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±a \t\t\n\n5 \tTosca Tango Orchestra  -  \tLastima Grande \t\t\n\n6 \tGlover Gill  -  \tNocturne In E-Flat Opus 9 #2 \t\t\nWritten-By - Chopin\n\n7 \tTosca Tango Orchestra  -  \tBallade 3 \t\t\n\n8 \tTosca Tango Orchestra  -  \tEl Cholulo \t\t\n\n9 \tGlovertango  -  \tNocturna \t\t\nWritten-By - Julian Plaza\n\n10 \tGlovertango  -  \tSuper Sport \t\t\n\n11 \tTosca Tango Orchestra  -  \tBallade 4 Part 2 \t\t\n\n\nCredits:\nArtwork By [Album Design] - Benjamin Wheelock\nExecutive Producer - Glover Gill , Richard Linklater\nMastered By - Phil Klum\nMusic By, Written-By - Glover Gill (tracks: 1 to 5, 7, 8, 10, 11)\nOther [Business And Legal Affairs For Tvt Soundtrax] - Jackie Susman , Janis Shen\nProducer [Soundtrack Album Producer] - Patricia Joseph","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f79962fb8b97312e0655e763ebe87a944f8d5f48","amp;dn":"Various+-+Waking+Life+-+Original+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack+%282001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f79962fb8b97312e0655e763ebe87a944f8d5f48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,153,98,251,139,151,49,46,6,85,231,99,235,232,122,148,79,141,95,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
