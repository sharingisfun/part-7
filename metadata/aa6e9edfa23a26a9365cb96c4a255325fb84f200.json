In Resource Revolution, management experts Stefan Heck and Matt Rogers describe how each in its own way exemplifies a resource revolution - a use of natural resources so effective it defies conventional wisdom and enables breakthrough performance where others see only limits and shortcomings.\nResource Revolution shows how to take what is being seen as a worldwide crisis and turn it into the biggest business opportunity of the past 100 years. The rapid urbanization of a new 2.5-billion-person middle class in Asia will create an unprecedented demand for oil, steel, land, food, water, cement, and other commodities over the next two decades. Heck and Rogers explore the ways in which innovators, including startups and global leaders from Cree to GE, have answered the challenge with practical steps to guide managers everywhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa6e9edfa23a26a9365cb96c4a255325fb84f200","amp;dn":"Resource+Revolution+-+Stefan+Heck+and+Matt+Rogers+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa6e9edfa23a26a9365cb96c4a255325fb84f200","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,110,158,223,162,58,38,169,54,92,185,108,74,37,83,37,251,132,242,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
