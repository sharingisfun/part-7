To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death. Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. The Executioner's Song is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of American loneliness and violence. It is a towering achievement--impossible to put down, impossible to forget.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68875fa5e638d7e27d95741a59889f564c34b276","amp;dn":"The+Executioner%27s+Song+by+Norman+Mailer+%28EPUB%2C+MOBI%2C+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68875fa5e638d7e27d95741a59889f564c34b276","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,135,95,165,230,56,215,226,125,149,116,26,89,136,159,86,76,52,178,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
