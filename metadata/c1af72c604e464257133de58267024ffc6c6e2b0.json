The album was a major crossover hit eventually selling over eight million copies in \nthe US (and thus going eight times platinum).The album peaked at No. 2 on the US Billboard 200, and No. 8 on\n the UK Albums Chart. Its success in the US boosted its predecessor, Slide It In, from gold to double platinum status.\n\nThis album was released in Europe as 1987 and as Serpens Albus in Japan, with different tracklisting.\n\n========================================\n\nTracklist\n\n1. \t&quot;Crying in the Rain '87&quot;   \tCoverdale \t5:37\n2. \t&quot;Bad Boys&quot;   \t  \t4:09\n3. \t&quot;Still of the Night&quot;   \t  \t6:38\n4. \t&quot;Here I Go Again '87&quot;   \tCoverdale, Bernie Marsden \t4:33\n5. \t&quot;Give Me All Your Love&quot;   \t  \t3:30\n6. \t&quot;Is This Love&quot;   \t  \t4:43\n7. \t&quot;Children of the Night&quot;      \t  \t4:24\n8. \t&quot;Straight for the Heart&quot;   \t  \t3:40\n9. \t&quot;Don't Turn Away&quot;            5:11\n\n============================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 1.72 GB\nAlbum                                    : Whitesnake\nTrack name/Position                      : 9\nPerformer                                : Whitesnake\nGenre                                    : Hard Rock\nRecorded date                            : 1987\n\n==================================\n\nAudio\n\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 5 842 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 192 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1af72c604e464257133de58267024ffc6c6e2b0","amp;dn":"Whitesnake+-+Whitesnake+%281987%29+Flac%5B24Bit+192KHz+Vinyl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1af72c604e464257133de58267024ffc6c6e2b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,175,114,198,4,228,100,37,113,51,222,88,38,112,36,255,198,198,226,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
