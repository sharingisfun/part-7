The power of the language is greatly multiplied by the thousands of gems freely available from the public gem server, but there are also some amazing tools that come already bundled with Ruby.\nIn this course, you'll learn how to use the standard libraries that come bundled in with every installation of Ruby. Tuts+ instructor JosÃƒÂ© Mota will teach you how to:\n- manipulate YAML, CSV and JSON data\n- apply delegation for better\n- fetch content from the web using Net::HTTP and the URI library\n- build Rake tasks\n- manage files\n\nYou'll be amazed how much can be accomplished using only the standard Ruby libraries! Each library will be taught with simple examples and exercises that you can adapt for your own programming problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5416ffb0933533fbf1cb9572ba76ca1dfb5908d7","amp;dn":"TutsPlus+-+Essential+Ruby+Libraries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5416ffb0933533fbf1cb9572ba76ca1dfb5908d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,22,255,176,147,53,51,251,241,203,149,114,186,118,202,29,251,89,8,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
