The film, which is directed by BAFTA winning director and keen cyclist Michael B.Clifford tells the story of cycling in the land that invented the modern bicycle, itâ€™s birth, decline and re birth from Victorian origins to today. The film weaves bicycle design, sport and transport through the retelling of some iconic stories and features interviews with notable contributors Sir Dave Brailsford, Gary Fisher, Chris Boardman, Ned Boulting, Sir Chris Hoy, Tracy Moseley, Mike Burrows and many more plus great archive, animation and music. Bicycle is a humorous, lyrical and warm reflection on the bicycle and cycling and its place in the British national psyche.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20 (~965Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 854x480\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: HE-AAC\r\nAudio Bitrate: 64Kbps ABR 24KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 86 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 641 MB\r\nSource: PDTV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ccdf236114bd7cd748f4a6b88cac84f4c3b9107","amp;dn":"Bicycle+PDTV+x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ccdf236114bd7cd748f4a6b88cac84f4c3b9107","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,205,242,54,17,75,215,205,116,143,74,107,136,202,200,79,76,59,145,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
