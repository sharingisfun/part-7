[Box set][Original recording remastered]\nThree Discs\nFLAC\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a re-seed. &lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nFats Waller (May 21, 1904 - December 15, 1943) born Thomas Wright Waller was an American jazz pianist, organist, composer and comedic entertainer. He was the youngest of four children born to Adaline Locket Waller, wife of the Reverend Edward Martin Waller. - from Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fats_Waller\n\nNot only was Fats Waller one of the greatest pianists jazz has ever known, he was also one of its most exuberantly funny entertainers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and as so often happens, one facet tends to obscure the other. His extraordinarily light and flexible touch belied his ample physical girth; he could swing as hard as any pianist alive or dead in his classic James P. Johnson-derived stride manner, with a powerful left hand delivering the octaves and tenths in a tireless, rapid, seamless stream. Waller also pioneered the use of the pipe organ and Hammond organ in jazz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he called the pipe organ the &quot;God box&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ adapting his irresistible sense of swing to the pedals and a staccato right hand while making imaginative changes of the registration. As a composer and improviser, his melodic invention rarely flagged, and he contributed fistfuls of joyous yet paradoxically winsome songs like &quot;Honeysuckle Rose,&quot; &quot;Ain't Misbehavin,'&quot; &quot;Keepin' Out of Mischief Now,&quot; &quot;Blue Turning Grey Over You&quot; and the extraordinary &quot;Jitterbug Waltz&quot; to the jazz repertoire.\n\nDuring his lifetime and afterwards, though, Fats Waller was best known to the world for his outsized comic personality and sly vocals, where he would send up trashy tunes that Victor Records made him record with his nifty combo, Fats Waller &amp; His Rhythm. Yet on virtually any of his records, whether the song is an evergreen standard or the most trite bit of doggerel that a Tin Pan Alley hack could serve up, you will hear a winning combination of good knockabout humor, foot-tapping rhythm and fantastic piano playing. Today, almost all of Fats Waller's studio recordings can be found on RCA's on-again-off-again series The Complete Fats Waller, which commenced on LPs in 1975 and was still in progress during the 1990s - from All Music Guide, http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hifyxqy5ldde~T1\n\n\nOriginal Release Date: September 26, 2006\n\nDisc 1:  Fats Waller Sings and Plays Fats Waller\n\n  1.
