When listeners identify with these thought patterns, they create what Tolle calls ?the little me,? a person imprisoned within rigidly defined boundaries. Yet, as he explains, ?the little me? is not the truth of who one is, but of who one was, and reflects a past that no longer exists. He gently guides listeners on a journey into the present moment, into that spacious stillness where they are more than they think ? where they are, in fact, part of a great, mysterious whole. Achieving this transcendent state allows listeners to move beyond self-defeating limitations and live lives of grace, ease, and lightness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94aa828bb8dce89b6dd08a2b58da153c45bde309","amp;dn":"Eckhart+Tolle+-+In+The+Presence+Of+A+Great+Mystery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94aa828bb8dce89b6dd08a2b58da153c45bde309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,170,130,139,184,220,232,155,109,208,138,43,88,218,21,60,69,189,227,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
