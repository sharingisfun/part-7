That dramatic guitar chord that kicks of A Hard Day's Night (album, song, movie) still jumps right out at you, slaps you in the face, and jump-starts your heart. And you know what? Both the music and the film are still as crisp and lively as they were in 1964. Of course, only the first seven songs are actually in the movie (and they are the strongest of the bunch, from the rousing rock &amp; roll of the title track and the hit single &quot;Can't Buy Me Love,&quot; to the beautiful ballads &quot;If I Fell&quot; and &quot;And I Love Her&quot;). But nobody's going to complain about having songs like &quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot; and &quot;Things We Said Today&quot; in the second\nhalf of the record; they sure don't feel like leftovers. Yet another high-point for John, Paul, George, and Ringo--four fab fellows who hit the highest heights imaginable. --Jim Emerson\n\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.A hard day's night                                   [02:34]\n02.I should have known better                           [02:43]\n03.If I fell                                            [02:20]\n04.I'm happy just to dance with you                     [01:56]\n05.And I love her                                       [02:30]\n06.Tell me why                                          [02:09]\n07.Can't buy me love                                    [02:12]\n08.Any time at all                                      [02:11]\n09.I'll cry instead                                     [01:46]\n10.Things we said today                                 [02:35]\n11.When I get home                                      [02:17]\n12.You can't do that                                    [02:35]\n13.I'll be back                                         [02:24]\n____\n\n30:12 min\n 45,7 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
