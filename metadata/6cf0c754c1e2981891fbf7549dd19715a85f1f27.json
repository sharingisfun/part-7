It was based on the Academy Award winning animated short Bob's Birthday, featuring the same main characters. The award-winning series is one of the few Canadian TV shows to ever have regular American exposure. In Canada, it was the highest rated Canadian made animation series ever when it aired in prime time on Global Television.\n\nThe show revolved around a married English couple named Bob and Margaret Fish, a middle class 40-ish working couple with no children and two dogs named William and Elizabeth. Bob is a dentist and Margaret is a chiropodist (podiatrist for American viewers, though the term was not dubbed and changed during US broadcasts of the episodes). Bob and Margaret struggle with everyday issues and mid life crisis. Stories often revolve around the mundane, but in a way which is imminently relatable. From the trials of shopping to dealing with friends who annoy them, but owe them a dinner.\n\nIn the first two seasons, Bob and Margaret lived in England, in the South London community of Balham. For the third and fourth seasons, however, they moved to Toronto, Canada, allowing the writers to explore the humour of culture clash. The move was actually inspired by the realities of funding, with certain Canadian tax benefits dependent on stories actually based in Canada. As such, to keep the series funded, the move was necessary. The creators of the series (real-life husband-and-wife David Fine and Alison Snowden, see below) chose to take an executive role on these latter two series, reviewing scripts and consulting, but not involved in the detail they were for the first two series. Snowden continued to provide the voice of Margaret, but Bob's voice, originally played by Andy Hamilton, was replaced by Brian George. Some of the Canada-based episodes use the &quot;culture clash&quot; theme to parody this pressure and regulation.\n\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_and_margaret\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122813/\n\nCreators: David Fine, Alison Snowden.\nDirectors: Harold Harris, Julian Harris, Karen Lessman.\nWriters: Andrew Nicholls, Darrell Vickers, Leila Basen, David Fine, Chas Lawther, Terry Saltsman, Rosie Shuster, Alison Snowden.\nStarring: Alison Snowden, Andy Hamilton, Brian George, Peter Baynham, Steve Brody, Steve Coogan, Trevor Cooper, Jayne Eastwood, Chris Emmett, Sarah Hadland, Dwayne Hill, Doon Mackichan, Ron Pardo, Wayne Robson.\n\nVLC Player Compatible (verson # 0.8.6f): {Tested and Confirmed}\n\nSeason 1...\n\nS1E00 - Bob's Birthday (Pilot)\nS1E01 - A Tale of Two Dentists\nS1E02 - A Night In\nS1E03 - Blood, Sweat and Tears\nS1E04 - The Burglary\nS1E05 - Shopping\nS1E06 - The Holiday\nS1E07 - For Pete's Sake\nS1E08 - Friends for Dinner\nS1E09 - Love's Labours Lost\nS1E10 - The Dental Convention\nS1E11 - The Discomfort of Strangers\nS1E12 - Trick or Treat\nS1E13 - Neighbors\n\nSeason 2...\n\nS2E01 - Bob Gets Wired\nS2E02 - No Trouble\nS2E03 - The Trouble With Mummy\nS2E04 - The Fly on the Wall\nS2E05 - Problems\nS2E06 - A Patient Dies in Bob's Chair\nS2E07 - Cuckoo in the Nest\nS2E08 - A New Life\nS2E09 - Animal Behaviour\nS2E10 - Party Politics\nS2E11 - Going Dutch\nS2E12 - My Foot Hurts\nS2E13 - A Bob or Two\n\nSeason 3...\n\nS3E01 - Stranded in Toronto\nS3E02 - Strangers in a Strange Land\nS3E03 - Margaret Gets a Job\nS3E04 - 'Til Death Do Us...\nS3E05 - The Wedding\nS3E06 - Fish at the Bat\nS3E07 - Over-Exposed\nS3E08 - Age Before Beauty\nS3E09 - Book Club\nS3E10 - On Location\nS3E11 - Cottage Country\nS3E12 - Driving Bob\nS3E13 - Undefended Border\n\nSeason 4...\n\nS4E01 - New Lease on Life\nS4E02 - Jury Duty\nS4E03 - The Player\nS4E04 - Getaway\nS4E05 - Mummy's Boy\nS4E06 - Gone to Seed\nS4E07 - The Candidate\nS4E08 - Life Saver\nS4E09 - I, Bob\nS4E10 - Mastermind\nS4E11 - Outward Bound\nS4E12 - Gary\nS4E13 - A Very Fishy Christmas\n\n[Episode Guide Included.]\n\nThis torrent is a part of Operation: Massive Information Leak, Wave Three.\nBloodLogic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cf0c754c1e2981891fbf7549dd19715a85f1f27","amp;dn":"Bob+and+Margaret+-+Seasons+1-4+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cf0c754c1e2981891fbf7549dd19715a85f1f27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,240,199,84,193,226,152,24,145,251,247,84,157,209,151,21,168,95,31,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
