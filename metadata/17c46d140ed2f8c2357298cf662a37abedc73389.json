Phil Goss places this discussion within an archetypal context drawing on the fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk to consider the deep tension in western culture between the transcendent masculine and the immanent feminine.\n\nOffering both developmental and socio-cultural frameworks, areas of discussion include:\n***the use of story and myth to understand gender\n***Jungian and post-Jungian approaches: updating anima/animus\n***working clinically with men, and with women\n***the developmental pathways of gender difference\n***power relations between men and women in the home.\n\nMen, Women and Relationships Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A Post-Jungian Approach will be a valuable resource for all those with an interest in analytical psychology including psychotherapists, psychoanalysts and counsellors, as well as those in the broader fields of social work and education who have an interest in gender difference and identity.\n\nAbout the Author\nPhil Goss is a Jungian Analyst and member of the Association of Jungian Analysts and the I.A.A.P. He is also Senior Lecturer for Counselling and Psychotherapy at the University of Central Lancashire","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17c46d140ed2f8c2357298cf662a37abedc73389","amp;dn":"Phil+Goss+-+Men%2C+Women+and+Relationships+-+A+Post-Jungian+Approa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17c46d140ed2f8c2357298cf662a37abedc73389","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,196,109,20,14,210,248,194,53,114,152,207,102,42,55,171,237,199,51,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
