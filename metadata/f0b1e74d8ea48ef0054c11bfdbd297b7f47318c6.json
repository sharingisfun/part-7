Bobby Timmons, a highly influential funk pianist, is in generally excellent form. Most of the songs feature his trio with bassist Sam Jones and drummer Jimmy Cobb but a ballad medley of &quot;You're Blase&quot; and &quot;Bewitched&quot; finds Timmons unaccompanied and he surprisingly switches to organ on his old hit &quot;Moanin&quot; (his only recorded appearance ever on that instrument) and vibes on &quot;Quiet Nights&quot; and &quot;Someone to Watch over Me.&quot;\n\nThe cover offers a hint: a silhouette of Bobby Timmons in all colors, but just a pinch of blue. No one can explain it, but the music Timmons wrote has always been more famous than the music he played. A father of soul-jazz, he was a sparkplug with Blakey and Cannonball, his times there magic. But here could do more, as he shows here. He turns wistful on ballads, highlights his partners (Sam Jones gets a lot of space) and even gives the vibes a charming go-round. There are many styles here, many flavors. And blues; thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s some of that too.\nWe begin &quot;From the Bottom&quot;. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nearly a duet; Jones is submerged in the fury of piano and drums. Jimmy Cobb is pure insistence; Timmons blisters it good, a line simply dripping with soul. (The note says the songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s here &quot;to keep his soul franchise&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it does that and more.) The keys go pouncing, and the cymbals float upward like smoke. The real deal, you bet.\n\nThe night grows calmer: Jones plucks high, while Cobb sets the samba with wonderful echo. Bobby starts &quot;Corcovado&quot; with ease, some notes more thought than played. He leaves, and Jones has another go at that riff. Now come the stars: Timmons, on vibes, has light touch and heavy vibrato. He makes it sound like a celeste, which is a wonderful choice: it sounds like pixie dust, scattered on an open field. Quiet, yet how it speaks! The piano medley goes solo, with two sides: the lush sophisticate on &quot;YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Blase&quot;, brittle rhythm on &quot;Bewitched&quot;. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a deconstruction, with unexpected turns, tempo shifts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ then back to the lush &quot;Blase&quot;. No one can hear this and say he canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do ballads. And yet they did ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I am bothered (bewildered, too.)\n\n&quot;If I Should Lose You&quot; scampers wild: hear Bobby rush and Jimmy match him blow for blow. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s big voicing, bits of blues, frantic little patterns ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ what doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t it have? &quot;Samba Triste&quot; takes gentle steps, then punctuated by loud chords ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ reminds me a bit of Wynton Kelly. A light effort, simple ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and charming. And &quot;Someone&quot; has another surprise: starting as a Big Ballad, the vibes come out. Brushes march on, the sustain rings forever; with less vibrato, Bobby sounds cool, his notes made of glass. The chords at the end do the trick, as does his note-rolling; this is no novelty. TimmonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ vibe skills are real, and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m glad he had the opportunity to show them. This &quot;Someone&quot; is certainly worth watching.\n\nThis is the third time Bobby taped &quot;MoaninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢&quot;; he premiered it with the Messengers, and a piano version appeared on This Here is Bobby Timmons. He returns to the organ, which he played in his uncleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s church; this sounds like a big model, with pipes. The sound is reedy, perhaps too thick on the theme but wonderfully spooky on the solo. Notes snake around, twist around corners, all before a big beat ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ thrilling. Jones gets practically his only solo (he has a short turn on &quot;Bottom&quot; ), and swoops low as the organ goes spectral. A different sound, and your ears should get acquainted. Same with this album; if you need proof Timmons is more than soul, here ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“tis.\n\nPersonnel:\nBobby Timmons (piano, organ, vibes)\nSam Jones (bass)\nJimmy Cobb (drums)\n\nBobby Timmons - From The Bottom Tracks:\n01  From the Bottom 4:59\n02  Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars) 4:17\n03  Medley: You're Blase/Bewitched 3:37\n04  If I Should Lose You 4:51\n05  Samba Triste 3:19\n06  Someone to Watch over Me 6:31\n07  Moanin' 5:31","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0b1e74d8ea48ef0054c11bfdbd297b7f47318c6","amp;dn":"Bobby+Timmons+-+From+The+Bottom+%281964%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0b1e74d8ea48ef0054c11bfdbd297b7f47318c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,177,231,77,142,164,142,240,5,76,17,191,219,210,151,183,244,115,24,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
