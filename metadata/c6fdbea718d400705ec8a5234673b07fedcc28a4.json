Using engaging graphics, Heads Up Psychology explores the big ideas from all areas of psychology including psychoanalysis, intelligence, and mental disorders.\n\nWith easy-to-understand coverage of all the approaches to psychology, and the ideas of more than 60 psychologists, from Asch to Milgram and Ramachandran to Zimbardo, this introduction to an often complicated subject is written with young-adult readers in mind, and is structured around the questions they often ask, like &quot;How do I fit in?&quot;, &quot;Who needs parents, anyway?&quot;, and &quot;Why do I feel so angry all the time?&quot;\n\nIn Heads Up Psychology, psychological theories are explained with the help of cleverly conceived graphic illustrations and diagrams to show how they relate to everyday life. Biography spreads give interesting insights into the lives and work of Freud, Pavlov, and more, while other psychologists and their big ideas are profiled in a comprehensive directory, and case study panels describe groundbreaking experiments in the field.\n\nSupports the Common Core State Standards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6fdbea718d400705ec8a5234673b07fedcc28a4","amp;dn":"Heads+Up+Psychology-+DK+Publishing+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6fdbea718d400705ec8a5234673b07fedcc28a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,253,190,167,24,212,0,112,94,200,165,35,70,115,176,127,237,204,40,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
