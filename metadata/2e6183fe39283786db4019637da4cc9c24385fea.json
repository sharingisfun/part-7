He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2014, having previously won the Austrian State Prize for European Literature in 2012 and the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca from the Institut de France for his lifetime achievement in 2010. His other awards include the Prix Goncourt in 1978 for his novel Rue des boutiques obscures and the Grand prix du roman de l'AcadÃƒÂ©mie franÃƒÂ§aise in 1972 for Les Boulevards de ceinture.\n\nModiano's novels all delve into the puzzle of identity, of how one can track evidence of his existence through the traces of the past. Obsessed with the troubled and shameful period of the OccupationÃ¢â‚¬â€during which his father had allegedly engaged in some shady dealingsÃ¢â‚¬â€Modiano returns to this theme in all of his novels, book after book building a remarkably homogeneous work. &quot;After each novel, I have the impression that I have cleared it all away,&quot; he says. &quot;But I know I'll come back over and over again to tiny details, little things that are part of what I am. In the end, we are all determined by the place and the time in which we were born.&quot; He writes constantly about the city of Paris, describing the evolution of its streets, its habits and its people.\n\n================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following book:\n\n* Missing Person - Patrick Modiano, Translated from the French by Daniel Weissbort, First published in French 1978, under the title Rue des Boutiques Obscures (Verbamundi) - ePUB, 147 pp. \n\n================================================================================\n\nMissing Person (French: Rue des Boutiques Obscures) is the sixth novel by French writer Patrick Modiano, published on 5 September 1978. In the same year it was awarded the Prix Goncourt. The English translation by Daniel Weissbort was published in 1980. Rue des Boutiques Obscures (literally 'the Street of dark shops') is the name of a street in Rome (La Via delle Botteghe Oscure).\n\nGuy Roland is a detective who, after the retirement of his boss, van Hutte, decides to leave in 1965 to find his own identity, which he lost after a mysterious accident fifteen years earlier that left him an amnesiac. Ascending the slopes of his tenuous past that seems to stop during the Second World War, he learns that he is called Jimmy Pedro Stern, a Greek Jew from Salonica living in Paris under an assumed name, Pedro McEvoy, and working for the legation of the Dominican Republic. This McEvoy Pedro was surrounded by friends: Denise Coudreuse a French model who shares his life, Freddie Howard Luz of Mauritius, Gay Orlov an American dancer of Russian origin, AndrÃƒÂ© Wildmer a former English jockey, who all decided in 1940 to get to Megeve to flee a Paris that had become more oppressive during the German occupation. Denise and Pedro had decided to flee to Switzerland, and paid a smuggler who abandoned them in the mountain, separating them and leaving them only lost in the snow.\n\nGuy Roland decides to leave France to try to trace Freddie, who went live in Polynesia after the war. When he arrives in Bora Bora, he learns that Freddie has disappeared, either lost at sea or by choice. The last link that remains for Guy Pedro Stern to track is an address that he held in 1930.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e6183fe39283786db4019637da4cc9c24385fea","amp;dn":"Missing+Person+-+Patrick+Modiano+%28Nobel+Laureate%2C+2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e6183fe39283786db4019637da4cc9c24385fea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,97,131,254,57,40,55,134,219,64,25,99,125,164,204,156,36,56,95,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
