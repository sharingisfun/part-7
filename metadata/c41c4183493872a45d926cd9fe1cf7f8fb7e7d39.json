We are currently a team of two programmers and two artists that founded the company in 2011.\n\n\nOur goals\n\nOur main focus is on how things move rather than how things look on the screen. We aim to bring our expertise in real time soft-body physics and soft-body physics model design to the forefront of game physics simulation, making available the technology and know-how to as a wide an audience as possible. To achieve this, we are designing the engine and corresponding assets, so as to be independent of the underlying game engine and Operating System.\nRight now the physics engine is running on a multicore CPU configuration, but we are also in the process of supporting GPUs via OpenCL.\n\n\nOur mission\n\nTo have realistic, accurate, destructible and malleable physics everywhere. To make anything possible.\n\n\nContact Us\n\nYou can get in touch with us in several ways:\nE-Mail us: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4a23242c250a282f2b27242d64292527&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFollow us on Twitter:\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel:\nVisit our FaceBook page:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c41c4183493872a45d926cd9fe1cf7f8fb7e7d39","amp;dn":"BeamNG+Techdemo+0.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c41c4183493872a45d926cd9fe1cf7f8fb7e7d39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,28,65,131,73,56,114,164,93,146,108,217,254,28,247,248,251,126,125,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
