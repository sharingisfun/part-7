This chronicling of the Foo FightersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ triumphs and tragedies will culminate in an in-depth behind the scenes perspective on the making of the new album: a process in which the band pushed itself forward by going fully back to basics and recording in GrohlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s garage completely on analog tape.
