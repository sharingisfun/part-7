This tribe is being pressured to move by the District Officer as their land will be flooded by the release of waters from a dam; but they refuse to leave their homes. Deeply Christian, the villagers compare Joe Moses to the real Moses due to his discovery in the reeds as was the baby Moses. With a broken leg and no money, Joe Moses is trapped in the village.\n\nVideo: XviD, 576x432, 1875 kbps, 25 fps, 01h31m35s\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 256 kbps, English, no subtitles\n\nVHS Rip, audio and video watchable but not brilliant, brief KCOP watermark\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JAafIaAGa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JAafIaAGa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaaFLaAgA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaaFLaAgA&lt;/a&gt;\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nEvidently this film is hard to find. Also, information is limited, but regarding RUNNING TIME here are some user comments (for what they are worth) from IMDb:\n\n&quot;...I think I really would like this movie, but my version just runs 91 minutes (so there are about 25 missing)...&quot;\n\n&quot;...The film itself is very un PC. White missionaries trying to teach an African tribe the ways of Christianity...&quot;\n\n&quot;...My guess is that what is in the missing 25 minutes may be the really controversial scenes. Who knows...&quot;\n\n&quot;...Watching it I felt like it was poorly edited and not just to cut out and back to commercials. So now I know there's almost a full half hour missing...&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4eb20ec25d69e415c9de9f508a57d2c5b047111c","amp;dn":"Mister+Moses++-++1965++%28Robert+Mitchum%29++African+adventure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4eb20ec25d69e415c9de9f508a57d2c5b047111c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,178,14,194,93,105,228,21,201,222,159,80,138,87,210,197,176,71,17,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
