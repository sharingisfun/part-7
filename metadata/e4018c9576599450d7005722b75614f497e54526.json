I was looking around for a specific Rowan Atkinson 1988 HBO Special that nobody anywhere appears to have. BTW, in case anybody reading DOES have it (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234122/), PLEASE upload it and comment here to let me know! \n\nAnyway, I stumbled across a bunch of Rowan Atkinson stuff that was rather rare and also badly seeded. I thought I would put it together here as two large uploads. These consist of rare comedy concerts, TV appearances, and comedy albums in Part I, and as many of the NOT THE NINE OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢CLOCK NEWS episodes as I could find in Part II.\n\nPlease note that this torrent does NOT include any of the Black Adder, Thin Blue Line, or Mr. Bean material, since that is already torrented and seeded all over the place. DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ask me for it; just run a search and you wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have any problem finding them. It is worth noting that almost all of this material came form the torrent site THEBOX, which specializes in BBC TV. Keep in mind that most of the video is from old VHS rips. They are offered AS IS. DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t bother whining about quality or format, this is what I could find. All IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m doing is lumping it together for easier distribution.\n\nPart I is here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5213141/Rowan_Atkinson_-_Comedy_Collection_Part_I\n\nPart II consists entirely of Not the Nine O'Clock News episodes in various formats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4018c9576599450d7005722b75614f497e54526","amp;dn":"Rowan+Atkinson+-+Comedy+Collection+Part+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4018c9576599450d7005722b75614f497e54526","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,1,140,149,118,89,148,80,215,0,87,34,183,86,20,244,151,229,69,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
