The Show's annual goal is to bring animated shorts into more proper theaters than any other program in American history.\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_cathedral180w.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_cathedral180w.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTHE CATHEDRAL (2002)  \nTechnique: 3D Animation \nCountry: Poland \n\nBased on the novel by Jacek Dukaj, the Cathedral is the story of a pilgrim who arrives at the edge of the world at the end of a long journey. Here he finds the Cathedral, a place full of secrets. The Cathedral is not just a building, and the pilgrim is not just a man.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_filmguy180h.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_filmguy180h.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEARLY PENCIL TESTS AND OTHER EXPERIMENTS BY MIKE JUDGE (CIRCA 1990)  \nTechnique: Traditional 2D Animation \nCountry: USA \n\nA collection of never-before-seen character animation and experiments 'from the archives' of Mike Judge, plus the very rare early short film, Huh? and the first Office Space animated short with Milton - later to become the inspiration for the live action feature film.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_fifty180w.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_fifty180w.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFIFTY PERCENT GREY (2001)  \n2002 Academy Award Nominee - Best Animated Short Film \nTechnique: 3D Animation \nCountry: Ireland \n\n\nA dead solider wakes up to find himself with his gun, a widescreen TV, and a whole lot of time... \n\nThe director comments... &quot;My idea was to make a story where the character starts out a hero, turns into a coward and ends up a fool. It's basically a big cruel trick played on him by whoever controls the afterlife... It's nice to be able to make a movie that has a really unhappy ending, and yet people still seem to enjoy it. I know it's potentially controversial subject matter - there were complaints on Irish Radio after its run in the cinema... but at least I didn't try to tack on an upbeat ending, which I believe is a way of taking it more seriously.&quot; \n\nPRODUCTION CREDITS \na Zanita Films Production \na Short animated film by Ruairi Robinson \nProduced by Seamus Byrne \nEdited, Written and Directed by Ruairi Robinson \nMusic by Autechre\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_lacourse180w.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_lacourse180w.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLA COURSE ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â€šÂ¬ L'ABÃƒÆ’Ã…Â½ME (1992)  \nTechnique: Acrylic paint on cel \nCountry: Switzerland \n\n&quot;The Ride to the Abyss&quot;... Two riders on galloping horses disappear and reappear, alternating with other animated images moving to the same rhythm... \n\nGeorges Schwizgebel has directed 15 animated films during the last three decades, while also creating theatre sets, designing murals and participating in numerous exhibitions. His films reveal a plastic universe, one that surprises us with its efficient and economical use of lines while demonstrating a real sense of animated motion - all this accompanied by surprising musical twists and turns. \n\nPRODUCTION CREDITS \nAnimated and Directed by Georges Schwizgebel \nMusic: &quot;La Damnation de Faust&quot;, by Hector Berloiz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_mthead180w.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_mthead180w.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMT. HEAD (ATAMA YAMA) (2002)  \n2003 Academy Award Nominee - Best Animated Short Film \nTechnique: Traditional 2D Animation combined with CGI \nCountry: Japan \n\nAfter a stingy man eats some cherry seeds, a cherry tree grows on his head. A modern interpretation of the traditional Japanese Rakugo story, &quot;Atama-yama&quot;, set in contemporary Tokyo. \n\nThe director comments... &quot;Through the nonsense Japanese old comic story Atama-yama, I wanted to express a mixed theme - a connection between one's identity and the public, and an everlasting idea such as the wonder of world being. This work is a completely independent project and took six years from planning to finish.&quot; \n\nPRODUCTION CREDITS \nAnimated, Directed, and Edited by Koji Yamamura \nScreenplay by Shoji Yonemura \nNarration and Shamisen by Takeharu Kunimoto \nMusic by Takeharu Kunimoto Syzygys \nSound Design by Koji Kasamatsu \nBased on the Original Story (rakugo), &quot;Atama-yama&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_parking180w.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_parking180w.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPARKING (2003)  \nTechnique: Traditional 2D Animation \nCountry: USA \n\nA single blade of grass in an otherwise pristine parking lot sparks an escalating war of wills. \n\nThe director comments... &quot;My apartment in New York City overlooks a parking lot, and I've often wondered about what kind of character lives and works in the tiny booth on the lot. I imagined the attendant as an egotistical, territorial megalomaniac who rules his domain with an iron foot and immediately disposing of any uninvited trespasser, like a blade of grass. But, this is not your normal blade of grass as their duel of wits escalates, it becomes a Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote type of battle, with the final victory going to nature. I made the film in about two months and people enjoy its kinetic energy, good vs. evil theme, and the ending, in which nature survives over all.&quot; \n\nPRODUCTION CREDITS \nWritten, Directed and Animated by Bill Plympton\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_dasrad180w.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_dasrad180w.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTHE ROCKS (DAS RAD) (2001)  \n2003 Academy Award Nominee - Best Animated Short Film \nTechnique: Stop Motion Animation combined with CGI \nCountry: Germany \n\nThe stone people have seen a lot in their everlasting lives atop their mountain, so they're only mildly amazed by the comings and goings inside the valley below. But when Mankind begins to progress and grow, this new behavior threatens the rocks' serenity..\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_still5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_still5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWELCOME TO THE SHOW/ INTERMISSION IN THE THIRD DIMENSION/ THE END OF THE SHOW (2003)  \nTechnique: Traditional 2D Animation combined with Stop-Motion and Experimental Animation \nCountry: USA \n\nProduced exclusively for the first year of the Animation Show, this &quot;trilogy&quot; of shorts was animated, photographed, and completed in nine months (Oct 2002 to June 2003), during the off-hours of work on Hertzfeldt's new film, which was at the time three years into production. Shifting gears in the midst of such a difficult and relatively somber project to simultaneously animate something fun and silly again proved to be a welcome and much needed change. What was originally meant to be a very short trilogy to book-end the Show quickly ballooned into a much wilder and more experimental set of cartoons totalling eight minutes. \n\nCollectively, the three films are actually among Bitter Films' most expensive productions, due in large part to the multitude of special effects and trial and error experimentation required in photography. In addition to several optical effects shots - a backlight process developed for the new film but used for the first time here - there was a wealth of experimental animation: double exposures, shadow and lighting effects, stop motion hybrids, and more. The optical backlight effects (fire, lasers, etc) were all achieved traditionally and in-camera, via a process similar in theory to how the optical effects of the original 1977 Star Wars were created. As Hertzfeldt figured out how to pull more of these effects shots off, the metaphorical dam of additional ideas broke and the three pieces grew. \n\nPRODUCTION CREDITS \nCamera, Writing, Animation, Sound, Production, and Direction by Don Hertzfeldt \nEditing by Rebecca Moline \nVoices by Robert May and Don Hertzfeldt \nSound Production by Tim Kehl \nA Bitter Films Production\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_ricardo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_ricardo.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Adventures of Ricardo (1996)  \nTechnique: Claymation \nCountry: USA \n\nThree shorts from the wild mind of Corky Quakenbush introduce us to the misguided world of Ricardo and his adventures. \n\nPRODUCTION CREDITS \nDirected and animated by Corky Quakenbush \nVoiced by Corky Quakenbush \nProduced by Space Bass Films\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_billy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_billy.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBILLY'S BALLOON (1998)  \nTechnique: Traditional 2D Animation \nCountry: USA \n\nA boy and his balloon. \n\nPRODUCTION CREDITS \nWriting, Animation, Sound, and Direction by Don Hertzfeldt \nEditing and Direction Of Photography by Rebecca Moline \nSound Production by Tim Kehl \nA Bitter Films Production\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_brother_small.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.animationshow.com/i/c/1_brother_small.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBROTHER (1999)  \nTechnique: Claymation \nCountry: Australia \n\nBROTHER - The childhood memory of a brother, his cigarette butts, asthma and head lice. \n\nUNCLE, COUSIN and BROTHER, (THE TRILOGY) have all screened at over 300 festivals throughout the world and have won over fifty awards, including 4 Australian Film Institute Awards (Oz Oscars), 3 Aspen Shortfest Awards, 2 Dendy Awards amongst others and these are not only in the animation category, but also for script and direction. \n\nAdam has become one of Australia's most celebrated filmmakers, his short film trilogy, Uncle, Cousin and Brother, is one of the countries most highly awarded and successful collection of short films.
