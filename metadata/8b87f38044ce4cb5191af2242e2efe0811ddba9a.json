Its sprawling, encyclopedic narrative and penetrating analysis of the impact of technology on society make it an intellectual tour de force.\n\nGravity's Rainbow shared the 1974 National Book Award with A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories by Isaac Bashevis Singer (split award). That same year, the Pulitzer Prize fiction panel unanimously recommended Gravity's Rainbow for the award, but the Pulitzer board vetoed the jury's recommendation, describing the novel as &quot;unreadable&quot;, &quot;turgid&quot;, &quot;overwritten&quot;, and in parts &quot;obscene&quot;. (Kihss 1974) (No was awarded and finalists were not announced before 1980.) In 1975, Pynchon declined the William Dean Howells Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\n\n-----------\n\nStereo, 22.05 kHz, 64 kbps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b87f38044ce4cb5191af2242e2efe0811ddba9a","amp;dn":"Gravity%27s+Rainbow+--+Thomas+Pynchon+%28audio+book%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b87f38044ce4cb5191af2242e2efe0811ddba9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,135,243,128,68,206,76,181,25,26,242,36,46,46,254,8,17,221,186,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
