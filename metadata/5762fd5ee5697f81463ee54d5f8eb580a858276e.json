In all, he wrote twenty-five books, including sixteen novels, six non-fiction books and several collections of short stories. In 1962 Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nOften described as Steinbeck's most ambitious novel, East of Eden brings to life the intricate details of two families, the \nTrasks and the Hamiltons, and their interwoven stories. The novel was originally addressed to Steinbeck's young sons, Thom and John (then 6 and 4 respectively). Steinbeck wanted to describe the Salinas Valley for them in detail: the sights, sounds, smells, and colors.\n\nThe Hamilton family in the novel is said to be based on the real-life family of Samuel Hamilton, Steinbeck's maternal grandfather. A young John Steinbeck also appears briefly in the novel as a minor character.\n\nAccording to his last wife Elaine, he considered this to be a requiem for himselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½his greatest novel ever. Steinbeck stated about East of Eden: &quot;It has everything in it I have been able to learn about my craft or profession in all these years.&quot; He further claimed: &quot;I think everything else I have written has been, in a sense, practice for this.&quot;\n- - -\n\nFrom Recorded Books:\nWritten in his later years, SteinbeckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s novel follows the intertwined \naffairs of two families in southern California. As the saga unfolds, \nit also becomes a retelling of two powerful stories from Genesis: the \nfall of Adam and Eve, and the rivalry of Cain and Abel. Steinbeck crafted \nEast of Eden as a profound allegory and considered it, besides Grapes \nof Wrath (RB# 95707), his most important work.\n- - -\n\nAudie Award Winner\nAudioFile Earphones Award\nNobel Prize-winning author\nOprahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Book Club Selection\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5762fd5ee5697f81463ee54d5f8eb580a858276e","amp;dn":"EAST+OF+EDEN+-+John+Steinbeck.+Read+by+Richard+Poe+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5762fd5ee5697f81463ee54d5f8eb580a858276e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,98,253,94,229,105,127,129,70,62,229,77,95,142,181,128,168,88,39,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
