The group was founded by Frank Pucci.\n\nThe band name is derived from the act of cannibalizing, or eating a corpse; the word is crafted from the two Greek words nekron (corpse) and phagein (to eat). Necrophagia is one of the earliest death metal bands, along with others such as Possessed, Master, Death and Morbid Angel.\n\nHowever, they are quite often overlooked. Often the band is noted for vocalist Killjoy's vast variance in vocal talents as well as the instrumental differentiation between each album, as well a fair amount of band member changes over the years; many of which also highly esteemed in the extreme metal genres.\n\nNecrophagia remains a favorite among extreme metal fans and holds high importance in the death metal sub genre foundation.\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nFrank &quot;Killjoy&quot; Pucci - vocals\nAbigail Lee Nero - guitar\nScrimm - guitar\nDamien Matthews - bass guitar\nShawn Slusarek - drums\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\n1987 - Season of the Dead\n1990 - Ready For Death\n1998 - Holocausto de la Morte\n2003 - The Divine Art of Torture\n2005 - Harvest Ritual Vol. 1\n2011 - Death Trip 69\n2014 - WhiteWorm Cathedral\n\n\n\n2014 - WhiteWorm Cathedral\n\n\n\n01.
