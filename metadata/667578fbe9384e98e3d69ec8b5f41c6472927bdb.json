The group signed a new contract with the label when it was dropped by its previous label because of the extremely poor performance of its last two albums. Originally set to be distributed through Island/PolyGram Records, with which Gee Street had a distribution dealÃ¢â‚¬â€and a catalog number had been issuedÃ¢â‚¬â€this became the first Gee Street title to be distributed by V2/BMG after the labelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s purchase by Richard Branson for his new label empire.\n\nThe Jungle Brothers' career was plagued with delays and setbacks, which resulted in each of their albums being released several years after they were officially due. Their fourth effort, Raw Deluxe, is no different. The Jungle Brothers remain one of hip-hop's most inventive crews, crafting remarkably sophisticated, jazzy beats and rhyming with skill and intellegence, but they sound more as if they were aligned with late-'80s trends, not the styles of the late '90s. This isn't a bad thing, since they are musically and lyrically gifted, but it also makes Raw Deluxe sound more like an artifact than a blazing comeback.
