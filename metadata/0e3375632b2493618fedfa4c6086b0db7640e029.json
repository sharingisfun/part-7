This time around we give you an adrenaline pumping \n release with the music from Unreal Tournament. Of course the\n same team of producers is behind this one as well and the   \n names are as usual Alexander Brandon and Michiel van den    \n Bos. For this score there are four people who've got credits\n for the music though, Peter Hajba and Andrew Sega is the    \n other two musicians. The main brains being of course Brandon\n and van den Bos. Lots of great tunes in this game, I have to\n say that this is one of my favorite game scores. Just take a\n listen to Skyward Fire and ofcourse the &amp;quot;amen beat&amp;quot; pumping \n Foregone Destruction, I mean these tunes are just great.    \n\n I guess you all know by now how the ripping was done, but   \n let me just say (as I always do) that there's nothing       \n changed in the tunes or track names. They're just presented \n plain and simple as they are stored on the game CD. I hope  \n you enjoy the tunes as much as I do.                        \n\n http://www.unrealtournament.com/\n http://www.straylight-productions.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e3375632b2493618fedfa4c6086b0db7640e029","amp;dn":"OST+-+Unreal+Tournament+Score-2CD-1999-i","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e3375632b2493618fedfa4c6086b0db7640e029","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,51,117,99,43,36,147,97,143,237,250,76,96,134,176,219,118,64,224,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
