The running and animation of Arena and\nsome large simulation models can be calculation-\nintensive, so a faster processor results in less\ntime to perform these activities. In addition, since\nArena has a graphical user interface that typically\nanimates many items, a larger monitor (21ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) is\nrecommended, although not required.\n Under Windows NT, 2000, and XP, you must\nhave Admin privileges to install the software. To\nrun Arena, you should be a Standard user\n(member of the Power Users Group) or better.\nARENA SOFTWARE INSTALLATION STEPS\n\n\n\n\n\nINSTALL:\n\n1. Insert the Arena CD and the autorun program\nshould start. If not, browse to autorun.exe on the\nCD and double-click it to start the installation.\n\n\n2.

NOTE: You may\nreceive multiple activation disks. Only the serial\nnumber from the Arena product activation disk\n(e.g., Arena Basic Edition or Arena Standard\nEdition) should be entered.\n\n\n3. When choosing a location to install Arena on the\nPCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard drive, please note that Arena will be\nplaced in a subfolder of the one you specify.\n\n\n4.
