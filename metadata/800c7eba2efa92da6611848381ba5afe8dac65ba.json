Following the tragedy, their father, John, set out to teach his boys everything about the paranormal evil that lives in the dark corners and on the back roads of America . . . and how to kill it.\n\nFans of the blockbuster television phenomenon can rejoice! A one-of-a-kind compilation of all of Sam and Dean's demon-busting knowledge, The Supernatural Book of Monsters, Spirits, Demons, and Ghouls contains illustrations and detailed descriptions that catalogue the more than two dozen otherworldly enemies that most people believe exist only in folklore, superstition, and nightmares:vampires, ghosts, revenants, reapers, and even bloody clowns. You'll find within these pages Sam and Dean's notes, observations, and memories interwoven with sections of John Winchester's invaluable journal, making this book the perfect companion to every thrilling episodeÃ¢â‚¬â€and an essential weapon in the secret war against the hidden creatures of the darkness!\n\nThis book is not just for those who are fans of the CW show Supernatural. Eric Kripke, creator of the show, prides himself on the validity of the legends and myths he uses in his show. This book gives background information about things encounted by the Winchesters with a few new critters added in. The text uses Sam and Dean's voices for each section and fans of the show can easily pick out which Winchester is speaking each time. This book is a must for those who want to learn more about urban legends and things that roam the night","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:800c7eba2efa92da6611848381ba5afe8dac65ba","amp;dn":"The+Supernatural+Book+of+Monsters%2C+Spirits%2C+Demons%2C+and+Ghouls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"800c7eba2efa92da6611848381ba5afe8dac65ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,12,126,186,46,250,146,218,102,17,132,131,129,186,90,254,141,172,101,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
