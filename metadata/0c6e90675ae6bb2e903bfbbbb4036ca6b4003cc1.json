From the cake-icing Gothic detailing of the Woolworth Building to the shimmering Art Deco of the Chrysler Building, tall buildings make Manhattan the ideal image of a city. Manhattan Skyscrapers was the first book to document the highs and highers of the Big Apple's search for the sky. With its authoritative text by New York Times contributor Eric Nash, newly commissioned photos by Norman McGrath, and archival images of the city, the book became the reference work on the skyline. The city skyline changed dramatically on September 11, 2001, when its southern anchors, the World Trade Center towers, were attacked and destroyed. While mourning their loss, the city has continued to carry on its tradition of building.\n\n\nThe new structures that have arrived-the green skyscraper of the CondÃƒÂ© Nast Building, The Donald's soaring residential Trump World Tower, the hopeful Freedom Tower planned for Ground Zero-prove that the New York attitude still thrives. This new edition of Manhattan Skyscrapers covers ten new buildings including the glittering new LVMH tower and represents seventy-five historical structures, with such recent renovations as Louis Sullivan's Bayard-Condit Building. A new introduction by Skyscraper Museum Director Carol Willis adds insight into the city in the 21st century. This book is a must for both the serious student of architecture and the casual collector of all things New York.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c6e90675ae6bb2e903bfbbbb4036ca6b4003cc1","amp;dn":"Manhattan+Skyscrapers+%28Architecture+Photography+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c6e90675ae6bb2e903bfbbbb4036ca6b4003cc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,110,144,103,90,230,187,46,144,59,251,187,180,3,108,166,180,0,60,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
