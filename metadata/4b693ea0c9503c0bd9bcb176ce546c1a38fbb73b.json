This rare video is a Web Rip)\n\n&quot;Holiday&quot; is a song by American singer Madonna from her self-titled debut album. Released on September 7, 1983 by Sire Records, it later appeared remixed on the 1987 remix compilation You Can Dance and the 1990 greatest hits compilation The Immaculate Collection, and in its original form on the 2009 greatest hits album Celebration. Written by Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens of Pure Energy, the track was offered to Madonna by her producer John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez when she was looking for a potential hit track to include in her debut album. After accepting the song, she and Jellybean worked on it and altered its composition by the addition of a piano solo performed by their friend, Fred Zarr.\n\n\n\nFile Name:\nMadonna Holiday\n\nFile Format:\nmp4\n\nDuration:\n00:03:55\n\nBit Rate:\n1783k\n\nFile Size:\n50.07 MB\n\nVideo Codec:\nh264\n\nVideo Bitrate:\n1653k\n\nVideo Size:\n720x544\n\nAspect Ratio:\n1.32:1\n\nFrame Rate:\n29.97fps\n\nAudio Codec:\nmp3\n\nAudio Bitrate:\n128k\n\nChannels:\n2\n\nSample Rate:\n48000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b693ea0c9503c0bd9bcb176ce546c1a38fbb73b","amp;dn":"Madonna+-+Holiday","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b693ea0c9503c0bd9bcb176ce546c1a38fbb73b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,105,62,160,201,80,60,11,217,188,177,118,206,84,108,26,56,251,183,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
