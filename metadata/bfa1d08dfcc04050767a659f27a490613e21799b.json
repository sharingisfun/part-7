In many early civilizations the regularity of celestial motions was recognized, and attempts were made to keep records and predict future events. The first practical function of astronomy was to provide a basis for the calendar, the units of month and year being determined by astronomical observations. Later, astronomy served in navigation and timekeeping. The Chinese had a working calendar as early as the 13th cent. B.C. About 350 B.C., Shih Shen prepared the earliest known star catalog, containing 800 entries. Ancient Chinese astronomy is best known today for its observations of comets and supernovas. The Babylonians, Assyrians, and Egyptians were also active in astronomy. The earliest astronomers were priests, and no attempt was made to separate astronomy from astrology. In fact, an early motivation for the detailed study of planetary positions was the preparation of horoscopes.\n\nAuthor(s):\tClive Ruggles\nPublisher:\tABC-Clio Inc\nDate:\t2005\nPages:\t549\nISBN10:\t1851094776\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfa1d08dfcc04050767a659f27a490613e21799b","amp;dn":"Ancient+Astronomy+An+Encyclopedia+of+Cosmologies+and+Myth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfa1d08dfcc04050767a659f27a490613e21799b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,161,208,141,252,192,64,80,118,122,101,159,39,164,144,97,62,33,121,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
