The stereo songs are fantastic like Ella is in your living room.  We all have our own tastes in music specifications so if you can get past that these are some wonderful love songs for Valentine's Day or hot date :)\n\nIf you like this you may want to also look at Frank Sintra's love song compilation.  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9534345/Frank_Sinatra_Love_Songs_[FLAC_MP3](Big_Papi)_2001_Remastered&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9534345/Frank_Sinatra_Love_Songs_[FLAC_MP3](Big_Papi)_2001_Remastered&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFibnally, today I got that bright green TPB Skull.  Thanks for all you guys who downloaded my music who made that possible.  Bear hugs for the guys and squishy hugs for the ladies.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBy James Fenos\n\nSince UMG united Decca and Polygram, the issues of Ella's catalog have been an interesting mix of her Decca and Polygram recordings, something thought not possible a few years ago. This cd is not the first to put these two studio recordings together, however it's the first to present songs with a singular theme. Intimacy is the name of the game, this is a collection of the most intimate songs Ella's recorded. There are no strings here, this music is Ella with trio only, culled from all her albums including the songbooks. The mastering of this disc is excellent; Ella had a tendency to sing really close to the mike and it seems the producer of this disc chose only those songs with Ella up front. The Decca sides are presented here with the best sound to date; the songs are not too sanitized with noise reduction, so listening fatigue is avoided. Overall this is a great summary of her most emotional readings, something not usually associated with her.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                  Ella Fitzgerald - Ella for Lovers\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Ella Fitzgerald\nAlbum................: Ella for Lovers\nGenre................: Jazz\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2003\n\nFLAC\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 47 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality For MP3)\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 231kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
