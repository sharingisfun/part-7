This course goes through the entire process in real time, of creating a shot in which the live action footage interacts with our CG scene. We start out by matchmoving our footage in PFTrack and take a look at how we can easily solve multiple matchmoves. Then, we combine them in Maya to be part of a visual effects sequence. We then take the solved camera into Maya where proxy geometry is created for the live action hand and prop turntable. Many other things are covered such as animating, lighting using final gather and HDRI, UV mapping, displacement mapping, and rendering out many render passes. We then jump over into After Effects where we will be compositing 17 different render passes to create the final result in a linear workflow.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img692/1164/7rte.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img692/1164/7rte.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a145d690b77c58788b4cad396f5bec677dd7b068","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Creating+Hologram+Effects+for+Video+in+Maya+and","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a145d690b77c58788b4cad396f5bec677dd7b068","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,69,214,144,183,124,88,120,139,76,173,57,111,91,236,103,125,215,176,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
