During the last two decades, both single-walled and multi-walled CNTs probably represented the hottest research topic concerning materials science, equally from a fundamental and from an applicative point of view. There is a prevailing opinion among the research community that CNTs are now ready for application in everyday world. This book provides an (obviously not exhaustive) overview on some of the amazing possible applications of CNT-based materials in the near future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f621153a8089c7f9e6ec095a669f39a16af5c3eb","amp;dn":"Carbon+Nanotubes+-+From+Research+to+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f621153a8089c7f9e6ec095a669f39a16af5c3eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,33,21,58,128,137,199,249,230,236,9,90,102,159,57,161,106,245,195,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
