Born Henry John Deutschendorf in Roswell, NM, on December 31, 1943, he was raised in an Air Force family, and grew up in various regions of the southwestern U.S. As a teen, his grandmother presented him with a 1910 Gibson acoustic guitar, and while attending Texas Tech University he began performing local clubs. Adopting the stage surname &quot;Denver&quot; in tribute to the Rocky Mountain area he so cherished, he dropped out of college in 1964 to relocate to Los Angeles; there he joined the Chad Mitchell Trio, a major draw on the hootenanny circuit of the early '60s but in the twilight of their career at the time of Denver's arrival. Over time, however, Denver helped resuscitate the group on the strength of his songwriting skills; signed to Mercury, the Trio recorded a number of tracks, which the label repackaged in 1974 as Beginnings With the Chad Mitchell Trio. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tRCA/BMG\nCatalog:\t\t82876 60765 2\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Leaving On A Jet Plane\n02.Take Me Home, Country Roads\n03.Sunshine On My Shoulders\n04.Poems, Prayers And Promises\n05.The Eagle And The Hawk\n06.Rocky Mountain High\n07.Farewell Andromeda\n08.Annie's Song\n09.Back Home Again\n10.Sweet Surrender\n11.Thank God I'm A Country Boy\n12.I'm Sorry\n13.Calypso\n14.Fly Away\n15.Looking For Space\n16.Like A Sad Song\n17.My Sweet Lady\n18.Perhaps Love\n19.Shanghai Breezes\n20.Wild Montana Skies\n\n\nCD2 - Bonus CD\n\n01.Leaving, On A Jet Plane (Babe, I Hate To Go) (Previously Unreleased On CD)\n02.The Weight (Previously Unreleased)\n03.Annie's Song (Previously Unreleased Acoustic Mix)\n04.Calypso (Previously Unreleased Acoustic Mix)\n05.Amsterdam (Live At London Palladium)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77392ae04fbb26ca5d482b74f8db903c717c8137","amp;dn":"John+Denver+-+A+Song%27s+Best+Friend+Very+Best+Of+%282004%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77392ae04fbb26ca5d482b74f8db903c717c8137","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,57,42,224,79,187,38,202,93,72,43,116,248,219,144,60,113,124,129,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
