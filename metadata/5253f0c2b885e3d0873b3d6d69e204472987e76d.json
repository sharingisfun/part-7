To remain competitive, business firms look for ways of improving their ability to gauge business and economic conditions around the world. At the same time, advances in technology have revolutionized the way we process information and prepare business and economic forecasts. Secondary data searches, data collection, data entry and analysis, graphical visualization, and reporting can all be accomplished with the help of computers that provide access to information not previously available. Forecasters should therefore learn the techniques and models involved, as applied in this new era.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5253f0c2b885e3d0873b3d6d69e204472987e76d","amp;dn":"Business+Forecasting%3A+A+Practical+Approach+%2C+Second+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5253f0c2b885e3d0873b3d6d69e204472987e76d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,83,240,194,184,133,227,208,135,59,61,109,105,226,4,71,41,135,231,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
