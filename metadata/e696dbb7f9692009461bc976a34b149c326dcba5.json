Clark plays to the Chicago-Texas blues tradition and even covers Jimi Hendrix's &quot;Third Stone From the Sun.&quot; But he's no simple throwback. &quot;The Life&quot; and the title track have modern R&amp;B flow; &quot;Travis County&quot; is punkish roots rock, &quot;Glitter Ain't Gold&quot; matches Duane Allman slide with a glam-metal undertow. Best of all, Clark's brain-frying guitar solos are more about noise nuance and phrasing than speed-trial note-spitting.\n\nReleased 22 October 2012\n\n01 Ain't Messin 'Round\n02 When My Train Pulls In\n03 Blak and Blu\n04 Bright Lights\n05 Travis County\n06 The Life\n07 Glitter Ain't Gold (Jumpin' For Nothin')\n08 Numb\n09 Please Come Home\n10 Things Are Changin'\n11 Third Stone From The Sun/If You Love Me Like You Say\n12 You Saved Me\n13 Next Door Neighbor Blues\n14 Breakdown (Deluxe version bonus track)\n15 Soul (Deluxe version bonus track)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e696dbb7f9692009461bc976a34b149c326dcba5","amp;dn":"Gary+Clark+Jr-+%282012%29+Blak+and+Blu++Projeto+Chernobyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e696dbb7f9692009461bc976a34b149c326dcba5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,150,219,183,249,105,32,9,70,27,201,118,163,75,20,156,50,109,203,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
