Installation !!!\nIncludes Figure Metrics\nIf you get an error about not finding the DAZ Studio directory you may need to use the manual installer instead of the DIM (for DAZ Studio)\nYou have to add the serial by clicking on the About &gt; Plugins menu inside of DAZStudio.\nAny problems, just ask.\n\nDescription\nHave you ever loaded a figure into DAZ Studio and thought to yourself, Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½I wish there was an easy way to get accurate measurements?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Have you wanted a way to adjust your figure's proportions and see the measurements in real time? Now you can! The Measure Metrics plug-in will allow you to measure the length, diameter or angle of figures and props in your scene. It uses both Metric and US inches/feet. By using the Tape Measure, Tailor's Tape or the Protractor, you can remove the Ã¢â‚¬Å“guessworkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from your artwork. Measure Metrics comes with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pre-setÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ nodes to help you measure the dimensions of your favorite figures. It also allows you to set up your own nodes to measure any kind of props or even empty space between figures within your scene. A script included with Measure Metrics allows you to configure morphs which control the dimensions of your figure, allowing you to set the dimensions and have the figure automatically adjust the morphs to match the dimensions you entered. Measure your figure's or prop's dimensions or configure the tool to automatically set your figure to dimensions that you specify without having to adjust dozens of morph sliders. This is a fun and powerful tool!\n\nFigure Metrics\nFigure Metrics is an add-on script for Measure Metrics that allows you to quickly see and customize the measurements of your figure. Need your figure to be a curvy Ã¢â‚¬Å“36-26-38Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½? Enter your desired measurements into the form and the figure changes to meet those measurements. Want to adjust the figure's height? Enter that measurement and go.\n\nThe great thing about Figure Metrics, is that it will work on any figure with Measure Metrics nodes. You are not limited to the Genesis series alone. Measure the DAZ Horse 2, or Michael 4. You can even save presets to re-use later.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1c27fa3b2a3718c0efb989a7aa92ad1095094bd","amp;dn":"DAZ3D+-+Measure+Metrics+for+DAZ+Studio+-+%28DAZ+16684%29+-+Installer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1c27fa3b2a3718c0efb989a7aa92ad1095094bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,194,127,163,178,163,113,140,14,251,152,154,122,169,42,209,9,80,148,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
