Lucy discovers how upper-class dancing tastes were transformed by the introduction of the waltz at the beginning of the 19th century, which allowed couples to dance scandalously close.\r\nIn the 19th century, a greater proportion of the population than ever before lived in cities, and Len visits one of London's most beautiful Victorian gin palaces to find out about the drinking and the dancing that went on at a typical working-class knees-up. Whilst the working classes were letting their hair down, the middle classes were enjoying the latest dance music in the comfort of their own homes thanks to the invention of the upright piano. Lucy tries her hand at the 19th century's favourite tune - the Blue Danube waltz - on the piano once played by the BrontÃ« sisters.\r\nAt the Czech and Slovak Club in London, Len discovers the rustic roots of the 19th century's biggest dance craze - the polka. Together Len and Lucy take a series of polka classes with Darren Royston, historical dance teacher at RADA, as they prepare to dance it at a grand finale ball dressed in their full Victorian finery.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/63/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4c/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f3/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f1/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/62/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ee/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/87/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e1/Dancing-Cheek-to-Cheek-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.48 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 3\r\n * Part Size: 1.25 GB (average)\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04pztc3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e027aeaf752ad92f93d70ffa98bcafa521254f1","amp;dn":"BBC+Dancing+Cheek+to+Cheek+2of3+Revolution+on+the+Dance+Floor+72","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e027aeaf752ad92f93d70ffa98bcafa521254f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,2,122,234,247,82,173,146,249,61,112,255,169,139,202,250,82,18,84,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
