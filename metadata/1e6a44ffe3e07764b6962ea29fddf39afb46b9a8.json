VÃƒÂ¡squez is the author of three &quot;official&quot; novels Ã¢â‚¬â€ The Informers (Los informantes), The Secret History of Costaguana (Historia secreta de Costaguana) and The Sound of Things Falling (El ruido de las cosas al caer) all of which have been translated by Anne McLean.\n\nVÃƒÂ¡squez, who collaborates in diverse reviews and cultural supplements, also writes essays and is a weekly columnist in the Colombian newspaper, El Espectador. He has had critical success including the three cited novels. His stories have appeared in anthologies in different countries and his novels have been translated to various languages. Furthermore, he himself has translated works of John Hersey, Victor Hugo, and E. M. Forster, among others. He was part of the jury of 81 Latin American and Spanish writers and critics who in 2007 elected for the Colombian review, Semana, the best 100 books in the Castilian language in the last 25 years.\n\nThough he recognizes a debt to Gabriel GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez, his work is a reaction against magical realism, saying this with regard to The Secret History of Costaguana: &quot;I want to forget this absurd rhetoric of Latin America as a magical or marvellous continent. In my novel there is a disproportionate reality, but that which is disproportionate in it is the violence and cruelty of our history and of our politics.&quot;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe torrent contains following books, all in ePUB format:\n\n*  The Informers\n\n*  The Secret History of Costaguana\n\n*  The Sound of Things Falling -- Epub + Mobi\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead the following articles, interviews, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Gabriel_V%C3%A1squez&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Gabriel_V%C3%A1squez&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/books/review/the-sound-of-things-falling-by-juan-gabriel-vasquez.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/books/review/the-sound-of-things-falling-by-juan-gabriel-vasquez.html?_r=0&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.believermag.com/issues/201109/?read=interview_vasquez&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.believermag.com/issues/201109/?read=interview_vasquez&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A139&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A139&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://2paragraphs.com/celebs/juan-gabriel-vasquez/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://2paragraphs.com/celebs/juan-gabriel-vasquez/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/26/juan-gabriel-vasquez-life-writing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/26/juan-gabriel-vasquez-life-writing&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e6a44ffe3e07764b6962ea29fddf39afb46b9a8","amp;dn":"Juan+Gabriel+Vasquez+-+Colombian+Author+%283+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e6a44ffe3e07764b6962ea29fddf39afb46b9a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,106,68,255,227,224,119,100,182,150,46,162,159,221,243,154,251,70,185,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
