I always responded that I know of \n\nonly one book that accomplishes this extremely difficult task, \n\nand that is Chris Harman's A People's History of the World. It \n\nis an indispensable volume on my reference bookshelf.' (Howard \n\nZinn )\n\n'The left ... has few accounts which convey as well as this \n\nbook does the broad sweep of human history.' (Robin Blackburn )\nProduct Description\n\nThe only comprehensive 'bottom up' history of the world from \n\nthe earliest human society to the twenty-first century.\n\nChris Harman describes the shape and course of human history as \n\na narrative of ordinary people forming and re-forming complex \n\nsocieties in pursuit of common human goals. Interacting with \n\nthe forces of technological change as well as the impact of \n\npowerful individuals and revolutionary ideas, these societies \n\nhave engendered events familiar to every schoolchildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from the \n\nempires of antiquity to the world wars of the twentieth \n\ncentury.\n\nIn a bravura conclusion, Chris Harman exposes the reductive \n\ncomplacency of contemporary capitalism, and asks, in a world \n\nriven as never before by suffering and inequality, why we \n\nimagine that it canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or shouldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½survive much longer. Ambitious, \n\nprovocative and invigorating, A People's History of the World \n\ndelivers a vital corrective to traditional history, as well as \n\na powerful sense of the deep currents of humanity which surge \n\nbeneath the froth of government.
