Tracks of My Tears\n\n\nAmazon Review:\nLinda Ronstadt's appeal crossed so many genre lines it's impossible to categorize her as anything other than a gifted vocalist. She enjoyed success on country and rock charts alike with a voice that capably handled the requirements of both styles. There was a commanding roughness to her you-did-me-wrong classic, &quot;You're No Good,&quot; that mixed both soul and R&amp;B stylings into her vocals. In a similar vein, she handled the Motown standard, &quot;Heat Wave,&quot; like a pro, this time giving it the slightest hint of a country twang. She even rose to the occasion of covering Buddy Holly's &quot;That'll Be the Day.&quot; Rondstadt had some of her best moments with material that had a more emotional element, regardless of genre. &quot;Love Is a Rose&quot; and &quot;Tracks of My Tears&quot; are good examples of the disparate styles she could navigate with equal aplomb. Greatest Hits doesn't chronicle Rondstadt's hits past the mid-1970s, but is still worth owning, not only for the songs themselves, but as a point of reference in her career.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/4f/27/fa42c060ada00652d564a110.L.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/4f/27/fa42c060ada00652d564a110.L.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTitle: Greatest Hits, Vol. 2\nArtist: Linda Ronstadt\nOriginal Release Date: 1980\nRelease Date: December 19, 2006\nGenre: Pop\nFormat: flac\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.

Just One Look\n11. Someone To Lay Down Beside Me \n\n\nAmazon Review:\nThe latter part of the '70s found Ronstadt roughing up her image a bit, covering songs by the Rolling Stones and Warren Zevon and eventually taking inspiration from the burgeoning punk and new-wave scenes. All of this was a long way away from the laid-back country-rock sound that established her as one of the top female artists of the day. On the material collected here, Ronstadt remains as strong a singles artist as ever. Greatest Hits, Vol. 2 contains winners such as &quot;It's So Easy,&quot; &quot;Blue Bayou,&quot; and the Chuck Berry romp &quot;Living in the U.S.A.,&quot; as well as edgier material such as the Stones' &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; and Zevon's &quot;Poor Poor Pitiful Me.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d3ba195cf60b887d8902b9dbb8f641509829454","amp;dn":"Linda+Ronstadt+-+Greatest+Hits%2C+Vol.+1+%26+Vol.+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d3ba195cf60b887d8902b9dbb8f641509829454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,59,161,149,207,96,184,135,216,144,43,157,187,143,100,21,9,130,148,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
