Her father is Chaos' leader, and the club has always had her back. But one rider was different from the start. When Tabby was running wild, Shy Cage was there. When tragedy tore her life apart, he helped her piece it back together. And now, Tabby's thinking about much more than friendship...\n\nTabby is everything Shy's ever wanted, but everything he thinks he can't have. She's beautiful, smart, and as his friend's daughter, untouchable. Shy never expected more than friendship, so when Tabby indicates she wants more--much more--he feels like the luckiest man alive. But even lucky men can crash and burn...\n\nFire Inside (Chaos #2) by Kristen Ashley (June 4th 2013)\n\nLanie Heron isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t looking for loveÃ¢â‚¬â€no surprise, considering her last serious relationship nearly got her killed.
