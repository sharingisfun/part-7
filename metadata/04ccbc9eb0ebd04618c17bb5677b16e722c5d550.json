Instead of merely providing a catalog of bird song samples, BIRDING BY EAR actually teaches. This proven method has greatly enhanced the field experience for birders across North America. The authors have created learning groups of similar vocalizations and clearly point out distinguishing characteristics. \nUsing techniques such as phonetics, mnemonics, and descriptive words, Walton and Lawson provide a context for learning the songs and calls of eighty-five species of birds found east of the Rockies. Combine the auditory instruction here with the visual features of the Peterson Identification System. Page numbers in BIRDING BY EAR's booklet refer to species descriptions in the PETERSON FIELD GUIDE TO BIRDS OF EASTERN AND CENTRAL NORTH AMERICA, fifth edition.\n\n&quot;(Birding by Ear and More Birding by Ear) are the best tools yet for learning bird vocalizations.&quot; - Science Times\n\nDesigned to help listeners recognize birds of eastern and central North America by their songs and calls. \nPoints out exactly what to listen for to tell one bird from another.\n\nRecordings by the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology and the Borror Laboratory of Bioacoustics.\nSponsored by the National Audubon Society, the National Wildlife Federation, and the Roger Tory Peterson Institute.\n\n\nFrom Wiki:\n&quot;In this century, no one has done more to promote an interest in living\ncreatures than Roger Tory Peterson, the inventor of the modern field guide&quot;\n\nRoger Tory Peterson (1908 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1996), was an American naturalist, ornithologist, artist, and educator, and held to be one of the founding inspirations for the 20th century environmental movement. \nIn 1934 Roger Peterson published his seminal Guide to the Birds, the first modern field guide, which sold out its first printing of 2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡000 copies in one week, and subsequently went through 5 editions.\nHe edited or wrote many of the volumes in the Peterson Field Guide series on topics ranging from rocks and minerals to beetles to reptiles.
