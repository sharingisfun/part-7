The Boston-based quintet found the middle ground between the menace of the Rolling Stones and the campy, sleazy flamboyance of the New York Dolls, developing a lean, dirty riff-oriented boogie that was loose and swinging and as hard as a diamond.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tFlac Conversion\n\nComing on the heels of the commercially and artistically successful Pump, the fitfully entertaining Get a Grip pales against its predecessor's musical diversity. But it's not for lack of trying. In fact, Aerosmith try too hard, making a stab at social commentary (&quot;Livin' on the Edge&quot;) while keeping adolescent fans in their corner with their trademark raunch-rock (&quot;Get a Grip&quot; and &quot;Eat the Rich&quot;), as well as having radio-ready hit ballads (&quot;Cryin',&quot; &quot;Amazing,&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot;). The problem is, it's a studied performance -- it sounds like what an Aerosmith album should sound like. Most of the album sounds good; it's just that there isn't much beneath the surface. \n\n01.Intro\n02.Eat The Rich\n03.Get A Grip\n04.Fever\n05.Livin' On The Edge\n06.Flesh\n07.Walk On Down\n08.Shut Up And Dance\n09.Cryin'\n10.Gotta Love It\n11.Crazy\n12.Line Up\n13.Amazing\n14.Boogie Man\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6d01ccfb0c7ea26679b0f071608b993d5506ef2","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+Get+A+Grip+%281993%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6d01ccfb0c7ea26679b0f071608b993d5506ef2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,208,28,207,176,199,234,38,103,155,15,7,22,8,185,147,213,80,110,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
