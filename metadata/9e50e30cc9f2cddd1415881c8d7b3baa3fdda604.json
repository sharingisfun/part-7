This kind of shouting I donÃƒâ€ t like, I find it quite mindless and uninteresting, there needs to be some more style and character to a growl rather than the same note being shouted throughout. However Silent Screams have a cheeky little twist in their arsenal with the contrasting vocals of bassist Tom, leading the way in the chorus, I much prefer his harmonious singing and tend to ignore the other vocals. DonÃƒâ€ t be deterred though as if you like metal, this will be right up your alley anyway and probably wonÃƒâ€ t even be a second thought. Musically the band are massively tight and the quality of this album is stella! Chugs lead the way through When It Rains with structures, breakdowns and alterations similar to that of Killswitch Engage, but more ballsy! Silent Screams have the ability to switch between face melting chugs and melodic rhythms with such ease bringing the music together with a smooth cohesive flow. I bet this band would be awesome to see at a big name festival, get a beer and get listening.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Assume The Worst  (04:17), 8.18 MB\n02. Desperation  (03:45), 6.95 MB\n03.
