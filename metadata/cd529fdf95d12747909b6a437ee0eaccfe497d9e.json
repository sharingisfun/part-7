Two other members, Dyshon Benson &amp; Claude Thomas, left the group, and Darryl Anthony came on board. A demo by the group found its way into the hands of Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds through his mother-in-law, Jacqueline McQuam, who would one day hold various showcases to highlight their work. Impressed by their sound, Edmonds asked them to perform at a concert with After 7 and El DeBarge. Subsequently, the group added Boyz II Men founding member Marc Nelson. Az Yet first hit it big with a song from The Nutty Professor soundtrack, &quot;Last Night.&quot;\n\nDebut album\n\nAz Yet released their self-titled debut (and only) album in 1996 on LaFace Records. The album featured a &quot;who's who&quot; of musical heavyweights, including David Foster, BabyFace, Sheila E., and Brian McKnight. The first single, &quot;Last Night,&quot; reached #1 on the R&amp;B charts, #9 on the Hot 100, peaked at #2 on Australia's ARIA charts, and spent 2 weeks at #1 in New Zealand's RIANZ charts, ultimately achieving platinum status. The group's second single, &quot;Hard to Say I'm Sorry&quot; (a cover of the Chicago hit), was nominated for a Grammy award (Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals), reached #8 on the Hot 100, and achieved platinum status. Driven by these two singles, the album reached RIAA platinum status.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Last Night&quot;\n   2. &quot;Saved For Someone Else&quot;\n   3. &quot;Care For Me&quot;\n   4. &quot;Every Little Bit Of My Heart&quot;\n   5. &quot;Hard to Say I'm Sorry&quot; (featuring Peter Cetera)\n   6. &quot;That's All I Want&quot;\n   7. &quot;Secrets&quot;\n   8. &quot;Through My Heart (The Arrow)&quot;\n   9. &quot;I Don't Want To Be Lonely&quot;\n  10. &quot;Sadder Than Blue&quot;\n  11. &quot;Inseparable Lovers&quot;\n  12. &quot;Time To End The Story&quot;\n\nvbr mp3's","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd529fdf95d12747909b6a437ee0eaccfe497d9e","amp;dn":"Az+Yet+-+Az+Yet+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd529fdf95d12747909b6a437ee0eaccfe497d9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,82,159,223,149,209,39,71,144,155,106,67,126,224,234,204,254,73,125,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
