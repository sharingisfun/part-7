Once he took a turn towards dance music, there was no stopping his unique, haunting vocal style. Earning high profile features with Armin van Buuren, TiÃƒÂ«sto, Paul van Dyk, BT, Benny Benassi, Paul Oakenfold and many more of dance musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite, Burns has made his indelible mark on the scene over an impressive 10 year career.\n\nChristian Burns performed his first public song at the tender age of 13, starting a trend that would ultimately lead him to a number one smash and a lifelong career amongst the crÃƒÂ¨me-de-la-crÃƒÂ¨me of the Electronic Dance Music scene. \nWhen Ã¢â‚¬ËœSimple Modern AnswersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ landed last year, Link2Party noted that previously, Ã¢â‚¬Å“vocalists behind some of the most epic tracks to grace the dancefloor have been little more than a name on a record sleeve.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ With his solo album, Christian Burns shook that perception permanently, becoming one of the few dance vocalists to receive center billing on a full length release.\nThe album received critical acclaim across the board: Broadwayworld.com said Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is Christian Burns doing what he does bestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and EQ Music Blog noted Ã¢â‚¬Å“Christian Burns has managed to perfect the art of collaboration. Quite genius indeed. This solidifies his place as THE leading male vocalist in the EDM genre\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD1\n\n01.Chicane &amp; Ferry Corsten feat.
