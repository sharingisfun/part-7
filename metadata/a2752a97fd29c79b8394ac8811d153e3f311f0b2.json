Wrapped, rolled, or filled; steamed, fried, or bakedÃ¢â‚¬â€œAsian dumplings are also surprisingly easy to prepare, as Andrea Nguyen demonstrates in Asian Dumplings. \n\nNguyen is a celebrated food writer and teacher with a unique ability to interpret authentic Asian cooking styles for a Western audience. Her crystal-clear recipes for more than 75 of AsiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular savory and sweet parcels, pockets, packages, and pastries range from Lumpia (the addictive fried spring rolls from the Philippines) to Shanghai Soup Dumplings (delicate thin-skinned dumplings filled with hot broth and succulent pork) to Gulab Jamun (IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rich, syrupy sweets). \n\nOrganized according to type (wheat pastas, skins, buns, and pastries; translucent wheat and tapioca preparations; rice dumplings; legumes and tubers; sweet dumplings), Asian Dumplings encompasses Eastern, Southeastern, and Southern Asia, with recipes from China, Japan, Korea, Nepal, Tibet, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. \n\nThroughout, Nguyen shares the best techniques for shaping, filling, cooking, and serving each kind of dumpling. And she makes it easy to incorporate dumplings into a contemporary lifestyle by giving a thorough introduction to essential equipment and ingredients and offering make-ahead and storage guidance, time-saving shortcuts that still yield delectable results, and tips on planning a dumpling dinner party. \n\nMore than 40 line drawings illustrate the finer points of shaping many kinds of dumplings, including gyÃ…ï¿½za/pot stickers, wontons, and samosas.
