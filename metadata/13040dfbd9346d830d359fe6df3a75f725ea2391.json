It has been modified by me to correct things in the audio that I personally felt could be improved. These changes are completely subjective, and it's up to the listener to decide if they prefer this version or the original. Changes are applied to the stereo tracks found on the original CD.\n\nThe aim I had was to address a few different aspects I felt could be improved with the original release:\n\n- Bright EQ, and quite subtle bass-frequencies\n- Give the tracks some more air and room\n- Improve a perceived slight harshness in the overall audio, particularly the treble.\n\n\nSo the overall EQ of the tracks has been weighted more towards the lower half of the spectrum. Some targeted EQ has been applied to reduce stray harsh-sounding frequency areas in the upper range, particularly around 5-7 KHz.\nBasically the changes are made so that when listening at louder volumes, especially with my own headphones which I know well, there won't be one specific thing that causes the track from sounding too loud. In the case of Obzen the overall brightness of the tracks, aswell as some specific frequencies in the treble range, really felt grating too me at volumes where the lower register wasn't allowed to fill my ears. The EQ now is overall closer to for example the &quot;Catch 33&quot; album by the same artist, though I've made sure to try and keep the &quot;spirit&quot; of the original version alive, instead of completely conforming it to some ideal EQ curve.\n\nAlso some subtle harmonics have been applied to the bass region, to make sure the bass guitar and bass drum really have that extra oomph.\nThe overall EQ change gives a slightly darker, more relaxed feel to the tracks, and I've also used some subtle transient manipulation to try and give some extra life to the punchy elements of the tracks, mainly the drums. These 2 changes are the only creative additions I've added, and they are applied with maximum focus on them sounding natural.\n\nThe overall volume of the tracks has been reduced to not cut any peaks, even where the original is fairly un-maximized compared to other metal releases.\n\n\n\nI hope this might be of benefit to someone, and do give me your comments and criticism if you want.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13040dfbd9346d830d359fe6df3a75f725ea2391","amp;dn":"Meshuggah+-+obZen+2008+%28Custom+Optimization%29+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13040dfbd9346d830d359fe6df3a75f725ea2391","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,4,13,251,217,52,109,131,13,53,159,230,223,58,117,247,37,234,35,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
