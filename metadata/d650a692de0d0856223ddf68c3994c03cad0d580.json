RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Safedisc 4.6 / Custom\n1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Manager\n\nFootball Manager 2006 is a comprehensive soccer management simulation \n  offering a host of new features, including the ability for managers to \n  negotiate with their board of directors - not only for a better contract for\n  themselves, but also for improved player wage budgets and increased transfer\n  budgets or even stadium expansion. Be aware though, if you push too hard and\n  don't reach the heights that the board specifies, you'll soon be looking for\n  a new job. Half-time team talks add the ability to tell your players \n  individually or collectively exactly what you thought of their first half \n  performance, via the tactics screen. Will you be able to keep your players \n  motivated, or will you cause a collapse in the second half? Another welcome \n  feature is the ability to manage players on a personal level. Unhappy \n  players can cause huge morale problems for the whole squad and result in bad\n  performances, so the new Player Interaction feature will help you to manage \n  your team more closely. \n\n  1. Unrar.\n  2. Burn or mount with Daemon Tools.\n  3. Install the game.\n  5. Run FM2006_v602_422.exe located in the /crack directory on the CD to \n     update the game to version 6.02.\n  6. Copy the cracked executable located in the /crack directory on the CD to\n     your installation directory.\n  7. Play the game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d650a692de0d0856223ddf68c3994c03cad0d580","amp;dn":"Football.Manager.2006-RELOADED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d650a692de0d0856223ddf68c3994c03cad0d580","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,80,166,146,222,13,8,86,34,61,223,104,195,153,76,3,202,208,213,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
