Not every book is explicitly socialist in outlook; there are a handful of books in here that just relate to important developments in history that might be interesting to a socialist (for example, [i]King Leopold's Ghost[/i], a study of the horrors of Belgian colonialism in the Congo Free State, or Judith Butler's [i]Undoing Gender[/i].)\n\n\nA mixed bag of formats; EPUB and MOBI when possible, PDF otherwise, with some HTML, TXT and DOC mixed in when totally unavoidable. \n\nEPUB files can be read using most e-readers, tablets and phones, or using the free software [url=http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html]Sumatra[/url] (Windows) or [url=http://stanza-desktop.en.softonic.com/]Stanza[/url] (OS X). MOBI files can be read using Calibre, or transferred to Kindles (including Amazon Kindle software on tablets and PCs). PDF files can be read using Adobe Reader or Sumatra. DOC files can be read on Google Docs or in office software like LibreOffice or Microsoft Word.\n\nHighlights include\n\n[i]Reviving the Strike[/i] - Joe Burns\n[i]Slavery By Another Name[/i] - Douglas A Blackmon\n[i]Tear Down This Myth: The Right-wing Distortion of the Reagan Legacy[/i] - Will Bunch\n[i]Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower[/i] - William Blum\n[i]Women, Race, and Class[/i] - Angela Y.
