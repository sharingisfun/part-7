System programming is the practice of writing system software, which is code\nthat lives at a low level, talking directly to the kernel and core system libraries. Put\nanother way, the topic of the book is Linux system calls and other low-level func-\ntions, such as those defined by the C library.\nWhile many books cover system programming for Unix systems, few tackle the sub-\nject with a focus solely on Linux, and fewer still (if any) address the very latest Linux\nreleases and advanced Linux-only interfaces. Moreover, this book benefits from a\nspecial touch: I have written a lot of code for Linux, both for the kernel and for sys-\ntem software built thereon. In fact, I have implemented some of the system calls and\nother features covered in this book. Consequently, this book carries a lot of insider\nknowledge, covering not just how the system interfaces should work, but how they\nactually work, and how you (the programmer) can use them most efficiently. This\nbook, therefore, combines in a single work a tutorial on Linux system programming,\na reference manual covering the Linux system calls, and an insiderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guide to writing\nsmarter, faster code. The text is fun and accessible, and regardless of whether you\ncode at the system level on a daily basis, this book will teach you tricks that will\nenable you to write better code.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acbf711aea88aac55289a75248ea431b68112cac","amp;dn":"Linux+System+Programming+%281st+ed%29+%28by+Robert+Love%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acbf711aea88aac55289a75248ea431b68112cac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,191,113,26,234,136,170,197,82,137,167,82,72,234,67,27,104,17,44,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
