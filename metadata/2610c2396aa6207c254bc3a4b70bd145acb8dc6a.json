It is mainly known for its synthesis of diverse genres including drone, ambient, noise, and extreme metal. Supported by a varying cast of collaborators, the band has two core members: Stephen O'Malley (also of Khanate and Burning Witch) and Greg Anderson (of Goatsnake and Engine Kid).\n\nSunn is named after the Sunn amplifier brand, whose logo includes a circle next to the &quot;SUNN&quot; banner with waves heading off to the right (the band uses this logo in the cover art of many releases); In interviews, Stephen O'Malley stated that the name was also chosen as a play on the name of the band Earth, pioneers of drone music throughout the 1990s, reasoning that Sunn revolved around Earth. Before the band members moved to Los Angeles, the duo briefly used the moniker Mars.\n\nThe band's sound image is extremely slow and heavy, using electric guitars, in low tunings such as drop A, enriched by resonant feedback creating its soundscapes. There is very little drumming and a lack of any discernible beat. When performing live the band wears Grimm Robes, fills the air with fog, and plays at an extremely high volume.\n\nThe band releases the majority of its music through the label it founded in 1998, Southern Lord Records. However, the band released ÃƒËœÃƒËœ Void, its second album initially on Rise Above Records and Hydra Head Records, and Dirter Productions, with the latter pressing the album as a double vinyl. The Grimmrobe Demos was first released also on Hydra Head Records. It was later issued as a double picture record set by Outlaw Recordings and finally reissued by Southern Lord in 2004.\n\nSunn experiments with a variety of styles and sounds, progressing the primarily guitar and bass style of The Grimmrobe Demos and ÃƒËœÃƒËœ Void. On White1 and White2, Sunn noticeably expanded on conceptualization by inviting several guests (see collaborations below), resulting in everything from quiet meditative ambient sounds (&quot;A Shaving of the Horn that Speared You&quot; from White1) to a bizarre bass experiment track (&quot;bassAliens&quot; from White2). Black One continued this direction, utilizing far more electronics, synthesis, and other instrumentation than earlier Sunn material, yet still marking a significant return to its traditional sound.\n\nSunn is widely regarded as leaders in its genre, including by The New York Times Magazine of May 28, 2006, when the band was written up in an article called &quot;Heady Metal&quot; by John Wray. It was praised in an issue of Wonkavision, an independent music magazine, as one of the greatest modern metal acts. Sunn was also shown in the August 2007 issue of Q Magazine (the 'loud issue' ), with its album White1 being named the 18th-loudest album of all time, just above AC/DCs Back in Black and below Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced?\n\nIn 2008, Sunn released its live album DÃƒÂ¸mkirke, and also announced that it would do a mini-tour consisting of four concerts to commemorate the group's 10th anniversary to coincide with release of The Grimmrobe Demos.\n\nThe band's seventh studio album, Monoliths &amp; Dimensions, was released on May 18, 2009, and was acclaimed by both press and public alike.\n\nOn December 17, 2009, the song &quot;Hunting &amp; Gathering (Cydonia)&quot; from the CD Monoliths &amp; Dimensions was named the Heaviest Song of All-Time by Jason Ellis on The Jason Ellis Show on Sirius/XM. Greg Anderson then appeared on The Jason Ellis Show on January 12, 2010.\n\nThe group played the ATP New York 2010 music festival in Monticello, New York, during September 2010, where it collaborated with Boris to perform the Altar album live.\n\nFor live performances, Hungarian-born Attila Csihar has performed as prime vocalist since 2003.\nQuote:\nFrom Wikipedia: Ulver (Norwegian for Ã¢â‚¬Å“WolvesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) is a musical group from Norway. Since their first, folklore-influenced black metal release entitled Bergtatt - Et eeventyr i 5 capitler (1994), UlverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical style has been fluid and increasingly eclectic, blending genres such as rock, electronica, symphonic and chamber traditions, noise and experimental music into their Ã…â€œuvre, but with a heavy reliance on electronic recording techniques.\n\nAlthough UlverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first three albums are often called their Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black Metal TrilogieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, they are quite different in style, with only two of them belonging at all to the black metal genre. The archaic Dano-Norwegian lyrics were inspired by Baroque poets such as Ludvig Holberg and the hymn-writer Thomas Kingo. The themes of the lyrics were greatly influenced by Scandinavian folktales.\n\nThe album Bergtatt - Et eeventyr i 5 capitler is placed in the folk-themed black metal genre for its occasionally fast tempo, distorted electric guitars and croaky screaming vocals intermitted with melodious acoustic passages with singing, and for having a fantasy storyline. The title Bergtatt translates as Ã¢â‚¬Å“taken by the mountainsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; in Norwegian folklore the word refers to people who wander off into mountains, lured by trolls or other mythic creatures. The narrative of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrics follows a maiden as she becomes so mountain-taken. The subtitle translates as Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Fairytale in 5 ChaptersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Bergtatt features a melancholic, fully acoustic song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Een stemme lockerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Voice BeckonsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).\n\nKveldssanger, UlverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second album, contrasts with Bergtatt as it uses classical guitars, cello and chamber chants, completely eschewing the metal elements of Bergtatt, while still having a folk theme. Garm has since remarked that Kveldssanger was an Ã¢â‚¬Å“immature attempt at making a classical albumÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, later adding that the performance was immature, yet the content is strong when their youth at the time is taken into account.\n\nThe third album, Nattens madrigal (Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Madrigal of the NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), saw the band returning to a black metal style similar to Bergtatt. Unlike on Bergtatt, however, the only acoustic instruments appear in a brief interlude in the first track. The album is intentionally underproduced, akin to DarkthroneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Transilvanian Hunger, with buzzing guitars and rather muffled drums. There are rumors surrounding this album and its recording, the most famous being that the band recorded this album in a forest. A lesser-known rumor is that the band purposely recorded the album on a four-track cassette recorder and used the money that Century Media gave them for other things, like Armani suits, haircuts, cocaine, beer, and/or a new car. When questioned on this matter, Garm only affirmed that the band have expensive tastes.\n\nThemes from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, released early 1998, was very different from what Ulver had made before. Tore Ylwizaker, new composer and sound-architect, added to GarmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expanding artistic visions, and together they stepped over the boundaries of the black metal aesthetic, creating a genre-defying work. In this album, the musicians blended electronics, industrial music elements, progressive metal and avant-garde rock, and adding ambient passages. Lyrically, the album incorporates the entire text of William BlakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poem The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and relies on guest vocals. Despite confounding and perhaps alienating many fans of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first three albums, the album received widespread acclaim from critics within both the rock/metal and alternative music press. For instance, it was reviewed as album of the month in several high-profile magazines such as Terrorizer, Metal Hammer, and Rock Hard. It also ranked very high at many yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best polls that same year.\n\nIn 1999 the group declared:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ulver is obviously not a black metal band and does not wish to be stigmatized as such. We acknowledge the relation of part I &amp; III of the Trilogie (Bergtatt &amp; Nattens Madrigal) to this culture, but stress that these endeavours were written as stepping stones rather than conclusions. We are proud of our former instincts, but wish to liken our association with said genre to that of the snake with Eve. An incentive to further frolic only. If this discourages you in any way, please have the courtesy to refrain from voicing superficial remarks regarding our music and/or personae. We are as unknown to you as we always were.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nUlverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s next two releases, the EP Metamorphosis and full-length album Perdition City, were even more experimental and pensive than the Blake album. The band moved further away from rock and metal and into a more ethereal style, much like that of Coil. The use of programmed sound and atmospheric arrangements is dominant here, unlike the previous albums.\n\nThe band followed up these two releases with two minimalist/ambient/glitch EP's Silence Teaches You How to Sing and Silencing the Singing. These works featured minimal melodies and often had subtle, weird and unnatural noises within the song structures. Due to their individual rarity, they were later amalgamated as Teachings in Silence.\n\nHaving proved their proficiency at making atmospheric music, Ulver were soon hired to make music for motion pictures such as Lyckantropen, Svidd neger and Uno.\n\nSince 2003, Ulver graduated into a more symphonic style. They released the EP A Quick Fix of Melancholy, which kept the minimalist, sparse styles of their previous albums, albeit adding more dramatic and symphonic elements, with various string sounds and operatic singing styles.\n\nIn July 2004, the band had recorded their sixth album, Blood Inside, which was released on June 6, 2005. Bringing back more traditional rock instruments like guitar and acoustic drums, combining them with classical instruments, brass horns, and their rich electronic inventory.\nUlver also joined the drone band Sunn O))) on a fifteen-minute track which appears on Sunn O)))Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s WHITEbox box set, released in 2006. Additionally, the trio had announced back in 2002 that they had been working on a string remake of Nattens madrigal, but Garm later stated on the message board of his alternative rock band, Head Control System, that the project Ã¢â‚¬Å“is in a state of total dormancy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seventh album Shadows of the Sun was released on October 1, 2007. Garm described it as Ã¢â‚¬Å“our most personal record to date.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOn May 30th 2009 Ulver performed live for the first time in 15 years, at Maihaugsalen (part of Maihaugen: Europe's largest open air museum of old Norwegian houses and farmyards) in Lillehammer, Norway. The concert was part of the Norwegian Festival of Literature. The three band members were accompanied on stage by guest musicians such as Lars Pedersen (When) on drums and tubular bells, Daniel OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Sullivan (also of Ãƒâ€ thenor, Guapo and Mothlite) on guitar, bass and piano, Pamelia Kurstin playing the theremin and Ole Aleksander HalstensgÃƒÂ¥rd (Paperboys) as their DJ. Subsequently, appearances outside Norway were held at the Brutal Assault Festival in the Czech Republic on Aug 7th and at the Gagarin 205 club in Athens, Greece (November 16th). A few more festival appearances in Norway were announced: ÃƒËœyafestivalen at Middelalderparken, Oslo (Aug 11th), MÃƒÂ¸llafestivalen in Gjerstad (Aug 14st), Pstereo'09 at Marinen, Trondheim (Aug 21st) and London's Queen Elizabeth Hall (October 9th).\n\nIt has recently been announced on the official Ulver website that the core three members of Ulver have become four with the addition of British composer and multi-instrumentalist Daniel O'Sullivan. He was welcomed into the band via an official statement from the band, saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“we all know that God exists as three persons, but now is the dawn of the triangular pyramid.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\n\n\nGenre:\tDoom\nSubgenre:\tExperimental / Drone / Ambient\nBitrate:\tLossless\nSize:\t166.71 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n6 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2610c2396aa6207c254bc3a4b70bd145acb8dc6a","amp;dn":"Sunn+O%29%29%29+And+Ulver+-+Terrestrials+%282014%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2610c2396aa6207c254bc3a4b70bd145acb8dc6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,16,194,57,106,166,32,124,37,75,195,164,183,11,209,69,172,184,220,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
