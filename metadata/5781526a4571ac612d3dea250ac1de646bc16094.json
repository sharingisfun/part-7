Disease is presented in the context of family and culture, and the effects of inequality and problems of limited resources are addressed. The authors have a wealth of experience in front line healthcare and provide practical, evidence-based management guidelines for all the common and less common conditions likely to be encountered. This fourth edition has been thoroughly updated to incorporate the latest research findings and management guidelines. It includes an expanded section on maternal and child health, but careful editing has generated a slimmer volume, whilst retaining all of the essential content. This is the one essential text for medical students and healthcare professionals wanting a complete and up-to-date reference book on medicine in Africa.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5781526a4571ac612d3dea250ac1de646bc16094","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Medicine+in+Africa+4th+Ed+%5BPDF%5D%5Btahir99%5D+VRG.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5781526a4571ac612d3dea250ac1de646bc16094","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,129,82,106,69,113,172,97,45,61,234,37,10,193,222,100,107,193,96,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
