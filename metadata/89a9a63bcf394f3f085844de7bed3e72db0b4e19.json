This is a 12 disc box set. The audio problems and occasional video problems that were apparent in the original set released have been fixed. This set is much better.\n\nHere is a link to the set on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Sherlock-Holmes-Complete-Granada-Television/dp/B000RPCJB6/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1226506624&amp;sr=8-1\n\nThese are straight DVD rips. The only change I have made is to shrink each individual disc to fit onto a standard sized DVD-R using DVD Shrink. There is very little to no quality loss. All menus are intact. I don't know if there is a lot of interest in excellent quality DVD rips of this title since avi files are available but I for one prefer straight rips.\n\nLanguage Track in English\nSubtitles available in English and Spanish\n\nThis is a huge file but, honestly, it is easier for me to seed one big one than to try to keep 12 small ones alive. So please help me seed. If you decide to chose only download a few discs and then come back to download more, please direct the torrent to place the files in the same folder as it will recognize the files you previously downloaded and seed them for others to benefit.\n\nDisc One\nA Scandal In Bohemia\nThe Dancing Men\nThe Naval Treaty\nThe Solitary Cyclist\n\nDisc Two\nThe Crooked Man\nThe Speckled Band\nThe Blue Carbuncle\nThe Copper Beeches\n\nDisc Three\nThe Greek Interpreter\nThe Norwood Builder\nThe Resident Patient\nThe Red-Headed League\n\nDisc Four\nThe Final Problem\nThe Empty House\nThe Abbey Grange\nThe Musgrave Ritual\n\nDisc Five\nThe Second Stain\nThe Man With the Twisted Lip\nThe Priory School\nThe Six Napoleons\n\nDisc Six\nThe Devil's Foot\nSilver Blaze\nWisteria Lodge\nThe Bruce-Partington Plans\n\nDisc Seven\nLady Frances Carfax\nThe Sign of Four\n\nDisc Eight\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nThe Problem of Thor Bridge\nThe Boscombe Valley Mystery\n\nDisc Nine\nThe Illustrious Client\nShoscombe Old Place\nThe Master Blackmailer\n\nDisc Ten\nThe Last Vampyre\nThe Eligible Bachelor\n\nDisc Eleven\nThe Three Gables\nThe Creeping Man\nThe Dying Detective\nThe Golden Pince-Nez\n\nDisc 12\nThe Red Circle\nThe Mazarin Stone\nThe Cardboard Box\n\nSpecial Features on Disc 12:\nElementary, My Dear Watson - An Interview with Edward Hardwicke\nAn Interview with Adrian Conan Doyle\nDaytime Live - Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke\nSherlock Museum Short","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89a9a63bcf394f3f085844de7bed3e72db0b4e19","amp;dn":"Sherlock+Holmes+-+The+Complete+Jeremy+Brett+TV+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89a9a63bcf394f3f085844de7bed3e72db0b4e19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,169,166,59,207,57,79,63,8,88,68,222,123,237,62,114,219,11,78,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
