After all, the cocky smuggler and captain of the Millennium Falcon just played a key role in the daring raid that destroyed the Death Star and landed the first serious blow to the Empire in its war against the Rebel Alliance. But after losing the reward his heroics earned him, HanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got nothing to celebrate. Especially since heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deep in debt to the ruthless crime lord Jabba the Hutt. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bounty on HanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s headÃ¢â‚¬â€and if he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cough up the credits, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll surely pay with his hide. The only thing that can save him is a kingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ransom. Or maybe a gangsterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fortune? ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what a mysterious stranger is offering in exchange for HanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s less-than-legal help with a riskier-than-usual caper. The payoff will be more than enough for Han to settle up with JabbaÃ¢â‚¬â€and ensure he never has to haggle with the Hutts again.\n \nAll he has to do is infiltrate the ultra-fortified stronghold of a Black Sun crime syndicate underboss and crack the galaxyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most notoriously impregnable safe. It sounds like a job for miracle workers . . . or madmen. So Han assembles a gallery of rogues who are a little of bothÃ¢â‚¬â€including his indispensable sidekick Chewbacca and the cunning Lando Calrissian. If anyone can dodge, deceive, and defeat heavily armed thugs, killer droids, and Imperial agents alikeÃ¢â‚¬â€and pull off the heist of the centuryÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SoloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scoundrels. But will their crime really pay, or will it cost them the ultimate price?\n\n---\n\nEPUB\n\n---\n\nPost your book requests on TPB's forum to get a faster response!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:180b010c25c4777baf5a92cd246ee9551baf1766","amp;dn":"Star+Wars%3A+Scoundrels+%28req%3Asuprbay%29+-+spanikopita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"180b010c25c4777baf5a92cd246ee9551baf1766","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,11,1,12,37,196,119,123,175,90,146,205,36,110,233,85,27,175,23,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
