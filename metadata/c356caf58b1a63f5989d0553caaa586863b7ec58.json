YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn fundamental concepts such as memory management and thread synchronization, as well as the I/O Kit framework. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn how to write your own kernel-level extensions, such as device drivers for USB and Thunderbolt devices, including networking, storage and audio drivers.\n\nOS X and iOS Kernel Programming provides an incisive and complete introduction to the XNU kernel, which runs iPhones, iPads, iPods, and Mac OS X servers and clients. Then, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll expand your horizons to examine Mac OS X and iOS system architecture. Understanding AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s operating systems will allow you to write efficient device drivers, such as those covered in the book, using I/O Kit.\n\nWith OS X and iOS Kernel Programming, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll:\n\nDiscover classical kernel architecture topics such as memory management and thread synchronization\nBecome well-versed in the intricacies of the kernel development process by applying kernel debugging and profiling tools\nLearn how to deploy your kernel-level projects and how to successfully package them\nWrite code that interacts with hardware devices\nExamine easy to understand example code that can also be used in your own projects\nCreate network filters\n\nWhether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a hobbyist, student, or professional engineer, turn to OS X andiOS Kernel Programming and find the knowledge you need to start developing\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n\nOS X and iOS common core architecture\nHow to write extremely efficient code by exploiting kernel details\nCoding kernel-level extensions\nHow to write device drivers\nHow to program the I/O Kit framework\nKey mobile device topics like power management drivers and video capture modules\nTo understand OS X memory management and threads\nTo parse kernel debug messages and package projects ready for deployment\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is suited for:\n\nIntermediate and advanced iPhone and OS X programmers ready for the next step\nKernel-level programmers interested in how OS X and iOS function\nOpen source programmers with a background in Linux or BSD, OS X and iOS\nProgrammers interested in application performance\nSystem administrators running OS X clusters\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c356caf58b1a63f5989d0553caaa586863b7ec58","amp;dn":"OS+X+and+iOS+Kernel+Programming+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c356caf58b1a63f5989d0553caaa586863b7ec58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,86,202,245,139,26,99,245,152,157,5,83,202,170,88,104,99,183,236,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
