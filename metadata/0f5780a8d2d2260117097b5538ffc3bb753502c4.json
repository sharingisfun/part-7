Her recollections have one common denominator, the man she just met, Anthony Rawlings. Unbeknownst to Claire, for a very long time, she has been within AnthonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sights. Many of the pivotal events in her life occurred, due to his sinister manipulation. Every action has a consequence, and his actions result in their chance meeting. More than a psychological thriller, Consequences is a vivid story of one womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s struggle to survive incomprehensible circumstances. Every aspect of her being suddenly depends upon the tall, wealthy, dark haired, dark eyed businessman. Anthony Rawlings is known to the world as prosperous, benevolent, and kind. Claire quickly learns that he can also be a menacing controlling captor. With few options but concession, Claire attempts to earn her freedom, while enduring a hellish existence that truly appears perfect. Persevering tests and trials, she struggles to retain her pure Midwest values and beliefs. Encouraged by memories of a loving upbringing, she gains strength in the simplest of joys: solitude in nature and good in the face of evil. His goal in sight, AnthonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s calculated agenda encounters an unforeseen detour. He becomes captivated by ClaireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beauty, resilience, and determination. The interaction of these two compelling characters instigates strong emotions: fear, anger, love, and lust. Claire and AnthonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tumultuous journey flows into uncharted waters of intrigue and passion. Utilizing vivid detail, this 167,000-word novel unfolds like a movie, before the eyes of its readers. From the opening criminal abduction, through twists and turns, to the unlikely romantic thrills, the suspense climaxes as AnthonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s motivation becomes evident. Anthony and Claire must decide if they will stay true to one another, or allow preceding actions to result in justifiable Consequences.\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f5780a8d2d2260117097b5538ffc3bb753502c4","amp;dn":"Consequences+by+Aleatha+Romig+%7BPDF%2CEPUB%2C+MOBI%7D+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f5780a8d2d2260117097b5538ffc3bb753502c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,87,128,168,210,210,38,1,23,9,123,85,56,255,195,187,117,53,2,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
