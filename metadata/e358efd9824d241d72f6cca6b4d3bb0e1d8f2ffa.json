It's also the first game in Squaresoft's popular RPG series to feature voiceovers in addition to written text. Character expressiveness also reaches new heights with the aid of Squaresoft's &quot;Facial Motion System&quot;, adding subtle facial expressions to characters in real-time. New side-quests include the underwater sport of Blitzball, and a monster battle arena as well as a redesigned fighting system that mixes classic Final Fantasy elements with a new &quot;Sphere Grid&quot; system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e358efd9824d241d72f6cca6b4d3bb0e1d8f2ffa","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+X+%28PS2%29+%28NTSC%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e358efd9824d241d72f6cca6b4d3bb0e1d8f2ffa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,88,239,217,130,77,36,29,114,246,204,166,180,211,187,14,29,143,47,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
