Royally. Now Linda wants nothing to do with him. Or with BDSM. She wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even admit sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a masochist. As a dominant and sadist, he can give her what she needs, and when an opportunity arises, he slips into her life, intending to make amends. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s everything he knew she would beÃ¢â‚¬Â¦except for her bullheaded determination to be Ã¢â‚¬ËœnormalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nNow the horrible time is past, Linda just wants to return to her small conservative town, pick up her quiet life, and be normal. But how can someone who likes pain be Ã¢â‚¬ËœnormalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢? To her dismay, when someone spray-paints her home with obscenities, Sam shows up to rescue her. Again. DoesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t he understand that the last thing she needs in her life is a sadist? HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amused by her objections. But his dry sense of humor canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t disguise that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tough as nails and dominant and stubborn. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not going to let her drive him off this time. Soon she realizes she wants him to stay.\nWhen he takes her to the Shadowlands, she feels as if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s found a homeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ until she hears a voice from out of her nightmares.\n\nIf Only\nAfter the last fiasco, Sally gives up. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never find a Dom of her own. Instead the computer whizz is job hunting in between bending the lawÃ¢â‚¬â€just a bitÃ¢â‚¬â€to unearth the bastards whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d enslaved her friends. The clueless cops and Feds obviously need help.\nFBI special agents, Galen and Vance, have waited to play with Sally for a long time. When the mischievous submissive returns to the exclusive Shadowlands BDSM club after an ugly relationship, the experienced co-tops are pleased. Realizing sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suppressing her emotions, the powerful Doms push herÃ¢â‚¬â€only to find that her sassiness conceals a scarred and vulnerable heart.\nShaken by the unexpected emotional exposure, Sally flees the demanding Masters and the Shadowlands.\nBoth Galen and Vance have reasons not to seek a long-term submissive, but when a brutal attack by her ex-Dom sends Sally into their home, the two agents are driven to protect her. To help her. To take her under command. Falling in love isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t in the plans.\nBut as the little imp brings light into their lives, they begin to want moreÃ¢â‚¬Â¦until they discover sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hacked into an organization that delights in burning people alive.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8775987d107102f0243d96c1e014910d2907cf67","amp;dn":"Masters+of+the+Shadowlands+by+Cherise+Sinclair","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8775987d107102f0243d96c1e014910d2907cf67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,117,152,125,16,113,2,240,36,61,150,193,224,20,145,13,41,7,207,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
