Scotch emerged from barley, tequila from agave, rum from sugarcane, bourbon from corn. Thirsty yet? In The Drunken Botanist, Amy Stewart explores the dizzying array of herbs, flowers, trees, fruits, and fungi that humans have, through ingenuity, inspiration, and sheer desperation, contrived to transform into alcohol over the centuries.\n\nOf all the extraordinary and obscure plants that have been fermented and distilled, a few are dangerous, some are downright bizarre, and one is as ancient as dinosaursÃ¢â‚¬â€but each represents a unique cultural contribution to our global drinking traditions and our history.\nThis fascinating concoction of biology, chemistry, history, etymology, and mixologyÃ¢â‚¬â€with more than fifty drink recipes and growing tips for gardenersÃ¢â‚¬â€will make you the most popular guest at any cocktail party.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:079f56363de0ec49d407ae9e3c91b80b4d9a14b1","amp;dn":"The+Drunken+Botanist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"079f56363de0ec49d407ae9e3c91b80b4d9a14b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,159,86,54,61,224,236,73,212,7,174,158,60,145,184,11,77,154,20,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
