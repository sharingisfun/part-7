His live gets more and more troublesome after his \ngirl friend throws him out of their apartment and as last resort \nhe moves to Edgars place.\n\n\nReview 1:\n\nChristoph (Christoph M. Ohrt) a plainclothes policeman has been lax in his relationship \nwith his girlfriend. He picks up a stuffed animal thinking that he is being thoughtful. \nHe will be forgiven his thoughtlessness and all will be well. It doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t work out that way.\n\nWithout notice, his girlfriend has dropped him and kicks him out of their apartment with \nhis already packed belongings. Out he goes. In a daze over this rejection, \nhe gradually starts having his belongings stolen; canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t find a place to stay. \nSleeps in his car, until his car gets stolen while heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s shaving in a diner mensroom. \nHe gets completely wasted and passes out. When he wakes up, he is in a unfamiliar bed, \nnaked, next to Edgar (Tim Bergmann), a gorgeous gay mechanic.\n\nYou may have seen several &quot;straight guy wakes up with gay guy&quot; scenarios. \nRyan Reynolds played this in 2002s &quot;Buying the Cow.&quot; Thankfully, Reynolds \nisnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t homophobic like Christoph. (One reason to mention &quot;Cow&quot; is you get to see a \ndeliciously nude Reynolds). Or, you might remember 1994ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Maybe, Maybe Not.&quot; \n(Der Bewegte Mann). A very well made German, girlfriend throws boyfriend out film. \nTil Schweiger plays the hunky hetero.\n\nStereotypes run wild. They seem almost outrageous for a film released in 1996. \nPoints made in &quot;Regular Guys&quot; may necessitate the cliched characterization. \nThe strength of this film is in combining gay and straight experience with a \ncrime drama. These pieces may fit a bit too easily. There are fresh, unforgettable \nscenes in this film. The Police Station locker room is always the scene of \ninteresting action. The evolution of Christoph and EdgarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relationship may not end \nas we wish. Edgar says, &quot;The best love stories have sad endings.&quot;\n\nEven though Christoph constantly proclaimed his straightness, Edgar gradually put \nthe moves and sexual pressure on Christoph. There is an acceptable level of male \nnudity. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s natural and not gratuitous. There are No soft core sex scenes.\n\nEven though this is a foreign language film, the characterizations and plot \nmovements are understandable. You wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t feel like you have missed anything too \nimportant in the translated subtitles.\n\nI recommend this film for nice, light entertainment.\n\n\nReview 2:\n\nECHTE KERLE or REGULAR GUYS is a polished little 1996 comedy from Germany that \nmanages to tell a tale of mixing genders and satisfy all viewers no matter their \nviewpoint. Rarely has a film handled straight/gay juxtapostions with such an unbiased, \nhonest and relaxed vantage. So often these gender bender films have the look of \nmini-budget movies, but this film as directed by Rolf Silber based on a screenplay \nby Silber and Rudolf Bergmann is photographed with panache by Jurgen Herrmann is \nslickly creative and wholly professional.\n\nChristoph Schwenk (Christoph Ohrt) is a plainclothesman police officer who does \nstakeouts spying on criminals with his partners Mike (Oliver Stokowski) and Helen \n(Carin Tietze). As the film opens Christoph is thrown out of his place by his &quot;ignored&quot; girlfriend who has replaced him with a bodybuilder lover. \n\nDismayed and angry, Christoph \nbegins to drink, loses his car keys, his belongings on the street, and ends up with no place to stay as he stumbles into a gay bar where he passes out completely drunk. When he awakens he discovers he is in the arms of Edgar, a handsome auto mechanic who rehabs cars (?stolen?) and the question arises as to whether the two had sex during the night. Edgar is a kind and gentle man who evades this question, obviously feeling an attraction to Christoph. Edgar clothes Christoph so that he can find a place to \nstay and make it to work at the current stake out which just happens to be spying on \ncar thieves.\n\nAt work Mike and Helen notice something different in the paranoid Christoph who is \nmore interested in finding an apartment and resolving his question of the previous \nnight's sexual occurrences than he is with work. Unable to find any kind of hotel or \napartment at all, he sleeps in his car until he eventually has the nerve to accept \nEdgar's offer for him to move in with him. Christoph makes it clear that is his \nStraight and Edgar makes it equally clear that he is Gay and likes Christoph.\n\nThe relationship between Christoph and Edgar gradually strengthens, the threat of \nsexuality weakens to the point that as Christoph is seen in public with Edgar and \nwhen razzed at work, Christoph sides with the idea of appearing gay and has a \nwonderful locker room confrontation with his fellow cops that says a lot about \nthe barriers between gays and straights! Slowly, as Christoph settles into his \nnew living conditions, he becomes enamored with Helen who is more than ready to \npursue Christoph as she notices his &quot;machoisms&quot; dwindle. At the same time Edgar's \nweekend lover Marco (Andreas Pietschmann) causes Christoph to query his surprising &quot;jealousy&quot;. \nThe three police become friendly with Edgar and Marco and when it seems they may \nbe involved in the car theft ring under stakeout, they each find it easier to \nturn the other cheek and support each other.\n\nThe ending pairs off the various members of this story in a warm and funny way, \na manner which some may find predictable, but still satisfying and allowing \nall barriers to be down.\n\nThe cast is uniformly excellent - the cameo supporting roles are very well done - \nand for once a film about straight perceptions of gay life makes ALL of the \ncharacters non-stereotyped: the men are all handsome hunks and the women are \nall beauties. This is light entertainment, a comedy with a message well stated.\n\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS:\n\nIf you don't know how to watch the movie with the SUBITITLES - I recommend\nVLC MEDIA Player. Open the movie file and then in the Top menue pannel choose : \nVIDEO &gt; Subtitles Track &gt; Open File. Then choose the suitable subtitles.\n\nMOTTO: \n\nWe live in a very homophobic world full of prejudice and violence against the\nLGBT community. LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s change the world, reeducate the world in a good, modern, correct spirit! \nLetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s explain directly and indirectly to people how important is to respect \nand treat the LGBT community with respect. Spread the word! \nShare the movie with your straight and gay friends. \nA picture says a 1000 words. A Movie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ says a Million words.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91a34608858dbdf3e7a624cf99c75f836cbb5d0a","amp;dn":"Echte+Kerle.+Regular+Guys+%281996%29+%28Germany%29+GAY+INTEREST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91a34608858dbdf3e7a624cf99c75f836cbb5d0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,163,70,8,133,141,189,243,231,166,36,207,153,199,95,131,108,187,93,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
