Now, for the first time, it is available as an e-book.\n\nAll 435 of AudubonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant hand-colored engravings are presented in exquisite reproductions derived from the Audubon SocietyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own archival copy of the rare Double Elephant Folio. A generously illustrated introduction surveys AudubonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career, as well as the history of American bird art before and after him. Descriptive captions, hyperlinks to authoritative species profiles, and a new, scientifically based arrangement of the prints allow us to appreciate AudubonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s achievement in the light of modern ornithology.\n\nThis enhanced version of the e-book also features high-quality embedded recordings of birdcalls from the Cornell Lab of OrnithologyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Macaulay Library.\n\n\nBy Roger Tory Peterson\nPublished by Abbeville Publishing Group in 2013\nEPUB, Retail, 694 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd77ef25b0b719797465272b5ae55c68bfedffd9","amp;dn":"Audubon%27s+Birds+of+America+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd77ef25b0b719797465272b5ae55c68bfedffd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,119,239,37,176,183,25,121,116,101,39,43,90,229,92,104,191,237,255,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
