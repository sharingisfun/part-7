They were a continuation of the wars originally sparked off by the French Revolution of 1789 and threw Europe's armies into mobilization on an unprecedented scale.\r\nAugust 26, 1812 on the 124-km west of Moscow, in a field near the village of Borodino, two great armies fought final preparations for one of the bloodiest battles of the era. A quarter of a million people, more than a thousand guns. Here Borodino decided the fate of the entire campaign, the fate of Moscow, the fate of the whole of Russia.\r\n4-part project &quot;1812&quot; is a large-scale reconstruction of the 1812 war, the heroic events of the year in which Russia defeated Napoleon's France. The &quot;1812&quot; covers the main events of the war with Napoleon in the summer to the winter of 1812 - the moment when the &quot;great army&quot; invaded the Russian Empire, until the moment when its remnants were driven back. The basis of the film is the reconstruction of historical events, which immerses the viewer in the atmosphere of the battlefield.\r\nThe project tells about one of the brightest pages of Russian history - the war of 1812. The results of this campaign have largely determined the century of Russian history.
