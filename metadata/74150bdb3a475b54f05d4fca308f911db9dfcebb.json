We might think we know who first said 'famous for fifteen minutes', 'annus horribilis', 'the cold war' and 'let them eat cake'. It's 'a no brainer', you might say, but Max Cryer has a surprise or two in store for you. 'I kid you not'. In this very readable book, he explores the origins of hundreds of expressions we use and hear every day ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and comes up with some surprising findings. Never 'economical with the truth', he might just have 'the last laugh'.\n\nWe learn what they didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t say...'We are not amused'; 'Elementary my dear Watson'; 'Let them eat cake'; 'First catch your hare'.\nWe learn that the Bible doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mention Salome ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or seven veilsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\nWe learn about the origins of the infamous Mile High Club.\nWritten in Max CryerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s delightfully witty style, WHO SAID THAT FIRST? is a wonderful book to dip into or settle a friendly dispute. Remember, good books are 'few and far between', and 'you get what you pay for'. So buy this book, 'go ahead, make my day'.\n\nThe inspiration for WHO SAID THAT FIRST?\nDuring his years working in Hollywood, Max Cryer became acquainted with Lucille Ball ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ at the time the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most popular comedy actress. One day when they were having lunch together, Max complimented her on the amount of pleasure she gave, and Lucille replied: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I would be absolutely nothing without the writers. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all to do with the way things are written ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they create the springboard for me.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n\nThe remark stayed with Max for years, and he realised it was true. Very often the person who said an effective or memorable line didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t actually create it. As Lucille Ball had said, the person in the background should have the credit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but was usually invisible.\nThis is was what motivated him to seek not just popular expressions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but who had actually originated them.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74150bdb3a475b54f05d4fca308f911db9dfcebb","amp;dn":"Who+Said+That+First%3F+-+The+Curious+Origins+of+Common+Words+and+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74150bdb3a475b54f05d4fca308f911db9dfcebb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,21,11,219,58,71,91,84,240,93,79,202,48,143,145,29,185,223,206,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
