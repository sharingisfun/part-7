The MELT Method shows you how to eliminate pain, no matter what the cause, and embrace a happier, healthier lifestyle.\n\nOver a decade ago, Sue Hitzmann was at the height of her career as an international fitness presenter and instructor. She appeared to be in perfect health, yet she was experiencing debilitating pain in her foot. With a master's degree in exercise science and advanced training in neuromuscular therapy, she thought it would be easy to find out what was going on in her body, but even the most prominent doctors and physical therapists couldn't explain what was wrong. Although she was only in her twenties, Hitzmann's career was threatened and her quality of life was in decline.\n\nHitzmann learned the hard way that diet, exercise, and muscular strength are not the foundation of a healthy, pain-free body. As she sought the true source of her pain, she radically changed her focus from fitness to hands-on bodywork.\n\nIn her quest to live an active, pain-free life, she became fascinated by the emerging science of connective tissue, or fascia, which surrounds all aspects of your body, including your muscles, bones, nerves, and organs. The researchers she met were discovering that connective tissueÃ¢â‚¬â€the system of the body that supports, protects, and stabilizesÃ¢â‚¬â€was responsive, adaptable, and renewable. What Hitzmann came to realize is that connective tissue dehydration is the underlying cause of the daily aches, stiffness, and strain that leads to pain, as well as weight gain, sleep problems, and many other seemingly unrelated issues. Through her personal exploration and private practice, she developed the MELT Method.\n\nMELT can help you fall asleep more easily and sleep more soundly, have more energy during the day, improve your posture, reduce stress and tension, shed excess body fat, and reduce cellulite.\n\nWhile it may seem too good to be true, it's worked for more than 50,000 people. And now it can work for you. Live your best, most youthful and vibrant life possible. Free yourself of chronic pain and be healthy and active with MELT! \n\nThe MELT Method Ã¢â‚¬â€œ January 22, 2013\nBook Language: English \nPages: 300\nFile Type: Epub, Pdf\nFile Size: 6.32 MB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:368c3331d2b6282cd1016ddf2eda42f2c114e321","amp;dn":"The+MELT+Method+-+A+Breakthrough+Self-Treatment+System+to+Elimin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"368c3331d2b6282cd1016ddf2eda42f2c114e321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,140,51,49,210,182,40,44,209,1,109,223,46,218,66,242,193,20,227,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
