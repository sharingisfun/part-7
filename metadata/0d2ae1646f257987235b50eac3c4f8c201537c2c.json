I\\'ve taken these from various sources over the years and painstakingly edited them: they all have their proper titles (uniformly put so that duplicates were immediately recognized and deleted), they are checked for completeness, page numbers were corrected where needed, many books were extensively photoshopped if they were badly scanned,too dark, too light, blotchy, crooked, scanner bed showing around, double pages with barrel effect, strange size, ugly watermarks etc...\n\nMany are in .pdf, many others in image format. If you have Acrobat Pro, and you prefer one or the other, you may very easily convert from one to the other. \nFrom Acrobat, File--Export--jpg. From the jpgs, select them, right click and \\&quot;Combine supported files in Acrobat\\&quot;\n\nFor all you crochet enthusiasts, with my love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d2ae1646f257987235b50eac3c4f8c201537c2c","amp;dn":"Crochet+afghan+%28throw%29+mega+collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d2ae1646f257987235b50eac3c4f8c201537c2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,42,225,100,111,37,121,135,35,91,80,234,195,196,248,194,1,83,124,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
