Here Grey and his regular road band extract the R&amp;B/soul elements and artfully expand upon them. \n\nThe title song is emblematic of the way Grey uses imagery from his Florida heritage as a means to telling a story: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œorange blossomsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a trigger to remembrance as much as a sign of the south. A crisp electric piano interlude presages the entry of horns as a melodramatic background on the track, much as the way Grey&amp;#039;s harmonica work precludes overemphasizing the mystical bent of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDew Drops.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nThe delicate balance that makes these tracks work no doubt resides in the long-standing working relationship Grey and MoFro have maintained with producer Dan Prothero (who has worked on every Mofro album to date). Of course, that wouldn&amp;#039;t mean much if material like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Devil You KnowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ didn&amp;#039;t contain a twist on the familiar aphorism, Daryl Hance&amp;#039;s tartly plucked guitar wasn&amp;#039;t accurately placed and the background vocalists didn&amp;#039;t restrain themselves enough. \n\nJJ Grey never becomes too intellectual for his own good. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEverything Good is Bad,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for instance, finds him singing so emotionally the feeling enlivens the words rather than the other way around; then, as the lyrics progress from a testament to personal temptation to a more universal observation about materialism, a swell of Hammond organ from Adam Scone opens the way for a majestic pump of The Hercules Horns (Dennis Marion on trumpet, Art Edmaiston on saxophone and Clay Watson on trombone). A similar turn of arrangment extends ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMove It OnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to close to seven minutes in length with no loss of dynamics. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShe Don&amp;#039;t KnowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is adorned with violin and cello that effect an insinuating mood, and Grey sings as if telling a secret, his own understatment indicative of how skilled a singer he&amp;#039;s gotten to be. The track avoids going soft at the center partially by dint of Anthony Cole&amp;#039;s rock-solid drumming in a modified martial rhythm. \n\nStrings appear even more prominently on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Truth,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ its portentous intimations carefully undercut by the simplicity of the lyrics and the means by which orchestration and horns dovetail up and round Grey&amp;#039;s straightforward vocal. JJ Grey and MoFro have always taken their studio recordings seriously and the transition from the shadowy likes of that track to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWYLFÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ demonstrates how much they&amp;#039;ve learned in seven years of recording. Wah-wah guitar bounces in time to electric piano to signal a lighter mood reflected in the whimsical title as well as a more extensive instrumental passage. \n\nMofro&amp;#039;s original direction as an idiosyncratic take on the bluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as on Blackwater (Alligator, 2001) and Lochloosa (Alligator 2004)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½bears slight resemblance to the current trajectory of the group where the shadow of Otis Redding is ever-present. Nevertheless, the pure pleasure the band takes in playing, during the breakdowns of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOn Fire,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for example, reveal no self-consciousness about roots precisely because they&amp;#039;re too absorbed in connecting with those roots. That said, it&amp;#039;s important to note the most obvious points of reference are utterly contemporary: the Lowell George-led Little Feat second-line rhythm on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMove It On,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Creedence Clearwater Revival in the elemental guitar of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYbor CityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Sly Stone for the horn tease on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHigher You Climb.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nJJ Grey and Mofro are clearly conscientious students of musical history and the clarity of purpose that permeates Orange Blossoms is as much a deliberate decision as the result of careful craft. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Believe (In Everything) might seem precious if Grey didn&amp;#039;t proffer it so matter of factly on this closing cut, as a simultaneous reaffirmation and benediction to all that&amp;#039;s come earlier. \n\n\nTracks: Orange Blossoms; The Devil You Know; Everything Good Is Bad; She Don&amp;#039;t Know; The Truth; WYLF; On Fire; Move It On; Higher You Climb; Dew Drops; Ybor City; I Believe (In Everything). \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7fbe88d012275063439a467f972d6e26c81c4a7","amp;dn":"JJ+Grey+%26+Mofro-Orange+Blossoms-2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7fbe88d012275063439a467f972d6e26c81c4a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,251,232,141,1,34,117,6,52,57,164,103,249,114,214,226,108,129,196,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
