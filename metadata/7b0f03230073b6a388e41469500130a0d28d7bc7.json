As she had done so many times before, she prepared his favorite ravioliÃ¢â‚¬â€a gesture of love and an expression of the traditions by which he had come to know her as a child. The care with which she prepared this meal, and the evident pride she took in her dish, led Gabriele to seek out grandmothers and their signature dishes in the sixty countries he visited. The kitchens he photographed illustrate both the diversity of world cuisine and the universal nature of a dish served up with generosity and love. At each womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s table, Gabriele became a curious and hungry grandson, exploring new ingredients and gathering stories. These vibrant and intimate profiles and photographs pay homage to grandmothers and their cooking everywhere. From a Swedish housewife and her homemade lox and vegetables to a Zambian villager and her Roasted Spiced Chicken, this collection features a global palate: included are hand-stuffed empanadas from Argentina, twice-fried pork and vegetables from China, slow-roasted ratatouille from France, and a decadent toffee trifle from the United States. Taken together or bite by bite, In Her Kitchen taps into our collective affection for these cherished family members and the ways they return that affection.\n\nIn Her Kitchen is an evocative, loving portrait of the power of food and family, no matter where in the world you sit down for dinner","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b0f03230073b6a388e41469500130a0d28d7bc7","amp;dn":"In+Her+Kitchen%3A+Stories+and+Recipes+from+Grandmas+Around+the+Wor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b0f03230073b6a388e41469500130a0d28d7bc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,15,3,35,0,115,182,163,136,228,20,105,80,1,48,160,210,141,123,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
