A mix of rootsy American rock 'n' roll and the best of\nthe British invasion, of jangling Byrds guitars and Stones-like rhythms, Damn he Torpedoes\nwas the album that took Petty into the major league and re-defined American rock.\n\nThis programme tells the story behind the conception and recording of the album and the\ntransformation it made to the band's career. Using interviews, musical demonstration,\nacoustic performance, archive footage and a return to the multi-tracks with the main\nprotagonists, it shows how Petty, Mike Campbell, Benmont Tench, Ron Blair and Stan Lynch\ncreated their songs and sounds with the help of co-producer Jimmy Iovine and engineer\nShelly Yakus. Additional comments from journalists and other producers and musicians help\ntell the story and put the album into its rightful place in rock history.\n\nRecorded in secrecy at a time the band was fighting for creative independence amidst a legal\nwrangle with their record company, the album is imbued with an anger and a gutsy attitude\nthe situation had created. Many songs from the album are still played live and form an\nimportant part of Petty's body of work, including Refugee, Here Comes My Girl, Even the\nLosers, Shadow of a Doubt, Louisiana Rain, Century City and top ten hit Don't Do Me Like\nThat.\n\nDamn the Torpedoes hit number two in the US for seven weeks, initially selling over 2.5\nmillion copies, and launched Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers onto the world stage and into\nsuperstar territory, standing as one of the great records of the late 70s and early 80s.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/94804455002645345468.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/94804455002645345468.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/94654931358037497608.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/94654931358037497608.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/21306973912804032097.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/21306973912804032097.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/64334592831846248762.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/64334592831846248762.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/54068323630658468119.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/54068323630658468119.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFormat : MPEG-4\nCodec ID : mp42\nDuration : 55mn 36s\nOverall bit rate : 1453 Kbps\n\nVideo\nBit rate : 1411 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.163\n\nAudio\nFormat : AAC\nBit rate : 224 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3414c5d0a652e6635693c257568d3e7c920751ba","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Classic+albums+Tom+Petty+-+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3414c5d0a652e6635693c257568d3e7c920751ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,20,197,208,166,82,230,99,86,147,194,87,86,141,62,124,146,7,81,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
