Some revisionists have tried to cast him as a sort of early blue-eyed soul figure, although he was probably more aligned with pop/rock, at first as the lead singer of the Belmonts, and then as a solo star. Drug problems slowed him down in the mid-'60s, yet he made some surprisingly interesting progressions into blues-rock and folk-rock as the decade wore on, culminating in a successful comeback in the late '60s, although he was unable to sustain its commercial and artistic momentum for long.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dion-p4100/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dion-p4100/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):\n\n24 Golden Greats contains all of Dion &amp; the Belmonts' biggest hits, plus all of Dion's solo hits from the late '60s and early '70s, making it the definitive compilation of the vocalist's long, successful career.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/24-golden-greats-r5846&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/24-golden-greats-r5846&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000CSN9DA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000CSN9DA&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
