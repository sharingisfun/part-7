Like Someone in Love  \n02. I Love You  \n03. Trane's Slow Blues  \n04. Lush Life  \n05. I Hear a Rhapsody \n\n \n\nRecorded in Hackensack, NJ on May 31, August 16, 1957 and January 10, 1958\n\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nTracks 1, 2, 3:\nJohn Coltrane, tenor saxophone\nEarl May, bass\nArt Taylor, drums\nTracks 4 &amp; 5:\nJohn Coltrane, tenor saxophone\nRed Garland, piano\nPaul Chambers, bass\nDonald Byrd, trumpet (track 4)\nLouis Hayes, drums (track 4)\nAlbert Heath, drums (track 5)\n\n\n\nLUSH LIFE is among John Coltrane's best endeavors on the Prestige label.\n\nThe first three tracks feature Coltrane without a pianist. The piano-less format is surprisingly full sounding and Coltrane's solos are at once fun loving and thoughtful. Tracks four and five feature a different rhythm section along with some elegant, delicate piano work from Red Garland.\n\nThe practically quarter-hour reading of Billy Strayhorn's &quot;Lush Life&quot; is not only the focal point of this album, it is rightfully considered as one of Coltrane's unqualified masterworks. . In addition, the cut features an astonishingly beautiful trumpet solo from the great Donald Byrd.\n\nLUSH LIFE is a perfect example of the master's early playing at itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most sensitive and exuberant. \n\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1001ddea536b0f6b1d0da20689222efedbee94b0","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Lush+Life+1957+%2F+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1001ddea536b0f6b1d0da20689222efedbee94b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,1,221,234,83,107,15,107,29,13,162,6,137,34,46,254,219,238,148,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
