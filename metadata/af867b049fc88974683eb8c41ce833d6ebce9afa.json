Mount FATE.iso\n2. Install by following the on-screen instructions.\n3. Play!\n\n#################################################\n\nAbout the game:\n\nAfter many days of travel, you've reached the forest town of Grove.\nOn the outskirts of town, and once inside the fiery dungeon gates, you'll find fame, adventure and fortune.\nGet tips from townspeople and acquire power with unique weaponry and magic spells.\nYour invincible pet defends you against monsters that lurk within dark, dangerous corridors.\nDetermine your FATE with unlimited replay and countless levels in this superb dungeon-crawling RPG!\n\n#################################################\n\nRelease Notes:\nTo install, simply extract anywhere. To play, run the Fate application.\n\nTo customize your resolution, open config.dat in a text editor and edit SCREENWIDTH:800 SCREENHEIGHT:600 to equal your monitor's supported resolution.\nDon't worry, as Fate can run on almost any custom resolution. (Got a 1920x1080 screen? Use it!)\n\nI have included the xmod_setup.exe for those who wish to apply the xmod (best mod ever for Fate--it is NOT a sex mod).\nSimply run it, select the Fate install directory, and choose what features you want to install.\n\nBesides the normal Fate.exe, I have included a backup of the original, uncracked version saved as Fate.exe.bak.\nI have also included a backup of the crack, should you accidentally delete it, saved as Fate.exe.crk\n\nCrack Notes:\n\nIn case you lose it altogether, here is what you need to hex Fate.exe (version 1.21 only):\nReplace EB3D8D45EF at 0x001A23D0 with 4090EB3B90\nReplace 75 at 0x001A31C4 with EB\n\n#################################################\n\nFAQs\nQ: Is this the full game?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Is this up to date?\nA: No! This is a slightly older version from before WildTangent encrypted the executable. Consequently, it is the last version compatible with the Xmod (not a sex mod). It is arguably better than the latest version, which merely added support for other languages and encrypted everything.\n\nQ: Why am I unable to save my games?\nA: You installed the game to a UAC-protected location (e.g., Program Files). To fix, move the game folder into a non-UAC-protected location (such as your documents folder) or edit the folder security settings to give your User account write access.\n\nQ: Does this require the cd to play the game?\nA: No.\n\nQ: Does this require Steam?\nA: No.\n\nQ: Do I need an unlock code?\nA: No.\n\nQ: Do I need any of the WildTangent Games platform crap?\nA: No.\n\nQ: Is this multilingual?\nA: No. English is the only language supported.\n\nQ: Will this installer work on a Mac?\nA: Buy me a Mac and I'll figure it out.\n\nQ: Does this contain viruses?\nA: No.\n\nQ: Is this version moddable?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Will you marry me?\nA: No.\n\n#################################################\n\nCredits:\nWildTangent Games for the game.\n\n#################################################\n\nIf you enjoy the game, BUY it.
