The book deals with different types of multiphase reactors on an individual basis including two widely used and important reactors that have not received adequate attention particularly: the ventury loop reactor and stirred reactors for cell culture technology.\n\nFor each reactor type the book discusses the basic theory, develops quantitative models for reactor design and operation and comments on the state of knowledge. After this treatment it proceeds to give illustrative reactor design procedures. The solved reactor design examples for industrially important applications are another attraction of this book besides the addition of the two important reactor types. Design of Multiphase Reactors features:\n\nBasic aspects of transport in multiphase reactors and the importance of relatively reliable and simple procedures for predicting mass transfer parameters\nDesign and scale up aspects of several important types of multiphase reactors\nIllustrated examples through design methodologies presenting different reactors for reactions that are industrially important\nA simple spreadsheet packages rather than complex algorithms / programs for computational aid\n\n\nThe approach used in this book is to develop reliable procedures for predicting mass transfer coefficients. The focus is on providing correlations that are independent of the geometric configuration and size of the reactor.\n\nVishwas G.
