Crackling with energy and \nsuspense, Special Circumstances places you in the center of an explosive \nmurder trial where politics and greed clash with truth and justice. \n\n  Fired by Simpson &amp; Gates, one of San Francisco's most prestigious law \nfirms, lawyer Mike Dailey quietly opens his own practice on the wrong side of \ntown. He takes on his first client when police arrest his best friend, a \npartner at Simpson &amp; Gates, for a brutal double murder. As Mike frantically \ndigs for evidence, he discovers the firm has a lot to hide-and his friend \nconceals a dirty secret, too. In this brilliantly paced, sharp-witted \nthriller, Sheldon Siegel reveals both the pitfalls and safeguards in our \ncriminal justice system. \n  Frank Muller's dramatic pacing keeps you on the edge of your chair from \nthe intriguing first chapter to the stunning conclusion.\n\nMike Daley series\n - Special Circumstances (2000)\n - Incriminating Evidence (2001)\n - Criminal Intent (2002)\n - Final Verdict (2003)\n - The Confession (2004)\n - Judgment Day (2008)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e96422c047096cc2705cadeac8e5288b72a894f0","amp;dn":"SPECIAL+CIRCUMSTANCES+-+Sheldon+Siegel.+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e96422c047096cc2705cadeac8e5288b72a894f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,100,34,192,71,9,108,194,112,92,173,234,200,229,40,139,114,168,148,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
