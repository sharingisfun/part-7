Memory migration, as defined by RomÃ¡n, maps the process by which memories of the past migrate into the working memory and are made conscious. Despite building a strong reputation in his youth, RomÃ¡n's career has stalled and he decides to return from abroad to spend a semester at his alma mater in Chile. No longer the pride of the university, the one person who continues to believe in RomÃ¡n's research is his bright young assistant Javier, who takes RomÃ¡n's past experiments to another level, insisting that memories migrate when triggered by moments of creative insight. RomÃ¡n volunteers to be the subject of Javier's experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 720x306, 23.976 fps, 639 Kbps, 01h24m20s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Spanish audio, optional English subtitles\r\n \nhttps://extraimago.com/images/2016/10/08/2d9445b153816a2f9d6c749401f3c30f.jpg \nhttps://extraimago.com/images/2016/10/08/837321b5d96afff4af9a40c49a6a3141.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2732e44fa2588a47173161c0e1915ef2669bcc17","amp;dn":"Roman%27s+Circuit+-+El+circuito+de+Roman+%5B2011+-+Chile%5D+sci+fi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2732e44fa2588a47173161c0e1915ef2669bcc17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,50,228,79,162,88,138,71,23,49,97,192,225,145,94,242,102,155,204,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
