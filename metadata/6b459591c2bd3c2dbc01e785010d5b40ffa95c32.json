They started out as a two-piece band composed of Sargatanas and Cernunnus (or Cern). They have been signed to Candlelight Records, Hammerheart Records and the Italian experimental label Code666. The band's earlier works, up to and including Under Ein Blodraud Maane, were somewhat atypical Norwegian black metal and were highly lauded by fans of the genre. However as of Vilosophe the band completely changed its sound to a hybrid of Jazz, Trip-hop, electronica and Metal with clean sung vocals and many progressive overtones. In spite of being highly acclaimed by critics this subsequent change of direction alienated most of their original fan base.\nIn 2004 they played at the Inferno Metal Festival.\n\nOn June 13, 2011, Manes released an official statement on their web site that they were calling it quits, although they would still release their final album, Be All End All, as well as an LP re-release of the debut Under Ein Blodraud Maane.\n\nOn May 11, 2013, Manes announced their return on the official Facebook page and that the album Be All End All is still going to be released.\n\n\nQuote:\nReview: Roel de Haan : It has been a while since the Norwegian art-rock/metallers of Manes graces us with a full-length. Predecessor Ã¢â‚¬ËœHow The World Came To An EndÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was released in 2007! However, as ever evolving as Manes is, it would be unnecessary to compare the releases anyway. Ã¢â‚¬ËœBe All End AllÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the title of their newborn and Manes delves even deeper into art-rock territories than before. The songs contains all kinds of details, electronic, guitar-wise or rhythmic. Even though the songs vary much in style from rockish to electronic and ambient, all of them seem to have a threatening and disheartening mood. Vocally still slightly reminiscent of Ozzy, there is a certain coldness permeating the music with each vocal line that is delivered. The quirky nature of the music itself and their structures is however quite demanding and this is surely not for everyone or anytime. Ã¢â‚¬ËœBe All End AllÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is very impressive and a successful return, but at as far inspiring awe in the listener it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Ã¢â‚¬ËœVilosopheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or How The World Came To An EndÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. But if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re into stuff like Ulver and Smohalla this comes highly recommended.\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\nManes: &quot;Name the Serpent&quot;\nGenre: Electronic\nSubgenre: Experimental / Electronic\nBitrate: 320 k\nSize: 91.25 MB\nShow/Hide Files:\n10 files ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b459591c2bd3c2dbc01e785010d5b40ffa95c32","amp;dn":"Manes+-+Be+All+End+All++mp3++%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b459591c2bd3c2dbc01e785010d5b40ffa95c32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,69,149,145,194,189,60,45,188,1,231,133,1,13,91,64,255,169,92,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
