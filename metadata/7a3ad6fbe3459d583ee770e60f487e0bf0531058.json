Having the ability to offer your partner this sensual pleasure brings special feelings of satisfaction and confidence--and you'll learn how to do it with skill, passion, and creativity through these intimate, beautiful photos and accompanying instructions. Preparing for the experience can be wonderful in and of itself, as you set the mood, select fragrant oils, and gently take the time to tune in to each other. Understand the different strokes (effleurage, petrissage, friction), and when and how to use each one. \n\nVary your touch to make it loving, erotic, stimulating, or even playful. Treat your partner to a 20-minute relaxing massage that will ease away the day's stress, or fully indulge in a longer, more stimulating massage where fingertips play lightly over the skin, the senses become heightened, and your bodies make full contact. You'll become an expert in this romantic art!\n\nAbout the Author\nSusan Mumford is a qualified massage therapist and has worked for several years in London health centres. She teaches introductory massage classes and relaxation techniques and has written several books on massage.\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a3ad6fbe3459d583ee770e60f487e0bf0531058","amp;dn":"Sensual+Massage%3A+A+Lover%5C%27s+Guide-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a3ad6fbe3459d583ee770e60f487e0bf0531058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,58,214,251,227,69,157,88,62,231,112,230,15,72,126,11,240,83,16,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
