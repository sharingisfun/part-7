Williams III and Mick Gray\n\nIt tells the story of Sophie Bangs, a college student from an alternate futuristic New York City in 1999, who embodies the powerful entity known as Promethea whose task it is to bring the Apocalypse.  Alan Moore weaves in elements of magic and mysticism along with superhero mythology and action, spirituality and the afterlife (in particular the Tree of Life) and science-fiction. Promethea is also notable for wide-ranging experimentation with visual styles and art.\n\nSophie Bangs was a just an ordinary college student in a weirdly futuristic New York when a simple assignment changed her life forever. While researching Promethea, a mythical warrior woman, Sophie receives a cryptic warning to cease her investigations. Ignoring the cautionary notice, she continues her studies and is almost killed by a shadowy creature when she learns the secret of Promethea. Surviving the encounter, Sophie soon finds herself transformed into Promethea, the living embodiment of the imagination. Her trials have only begun as she must master the secrets of her predecessors before she is destroyed by Promethea's ancient enemy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6303129e2ba96ed35507d86c11cbc15b73a69f22","amp;dn":"Promethea+%231-32+%2B+Extras+%281999-2005%29+%5BAmerica%27s+Best%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6303129e2ba96ed35507d86c11cbc15b73a69f22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,3,18,158,43,169,110,211,85,7,216,108,17,203,193,91,115,166,159,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
