ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere aint no grave that can hold my body down,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he sings \non the title track, but ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ placed at the top of the album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ thisnear-\ndelirious delivery from Cash is something of a red herring. \n\nElsewhere, he sounds peaceably reconciled to the ramifications of his \nown frailty. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTheres a train/ Thats heading straight/ To Heavens gate,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nhe sings on a sparsely ornamented version of Sheryl Crows Redemption \nDay, switching between images of human conflict and his own unshakeable \nfaith. \n\nSeemingly sung verbatim from his Bible, First Corinthians sees Cash \nsinging, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œO death, where is thy sting,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ over a back-porch waltz-time \nshuffle. \n\nCash may have once been welcoming of Rubins more unusual song choices \non Previous albums, but his most soulful performances on American VI \nare invested in Nashville standards. \nKris Kristoffersons For the Good Times, named Song of the Year in 1970 \nby the Academy of Country Music, should have long since emptied itself \nof the power to move, but Cashs elementary delight in one of the genres \nset texts takes on an eye-misting beauty. In the circumstances, Satisfied \nMind ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a song that has passed through Porter Wagoner, Bob Dylan and Jeff \nBuckley before him ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is no less of a shoo-in. \n\nIt would be nice to think that the curators of his legend will see fit to \nshut the book here, in the accompanying notes, Rubin echoes the point, \nconfirming that this is where his involvement with the American series ends. \nOthers may beg to differ, of course. This year (on a different label), \nwe have already had Johnny Cash Remixed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a self-explanatory ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œprojectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nstarring Snoop Dogg and Pete Rock that Cashs son claims his dad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwould have \nlovedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \n\nBut anyone else seeking a full stop to the longest goodbye in music history \nis better advised to find it at the end of American VI. \nTo hear Cash serenely intoning ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUntil we meet againÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on Aloha Oe amounts to \nmore than closure. Indeed, no man ever sounded so delighted to be to be \nserenading his own wake. \nIn honor of Johnny CashÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 78th birthday, the release of this album, Cashs \nlife, and all he stood for as a voice for those in need, Lost Highway Records \nis dedicating February 26th as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWear Black For JohnnyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Day. On the labels \nwebsite are details about the commemorative day, the new album, a stream of \nthe title track, and the lyrics to Cashs poignant classic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMan In BlackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nwords that remain as relevant today as when Cash first wrote them.\n\nA man, a songwriter, a legend; he is truly missed.\n\n_________\n\n 1.
