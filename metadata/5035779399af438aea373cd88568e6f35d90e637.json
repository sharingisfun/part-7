The aim was to render the legends, which form the second portion of this work, a picture of old Greek life; its customs, superstitions, and princely hospitalities, for which reason they are given at somewhat greater length than is usual in works of this kind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5035779399af438aea373cd88568e6f35d90e637","amp;dn":"The+Myths+and+Legends+of+Ancient+Greece+and+Rome+-+E.M.Berens.ep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5035779399af438aea373cd88568e6f35d90e637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,53,119,147,153,175,67,138,234,55,60,216,133,104,230,243,93,144,230,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
