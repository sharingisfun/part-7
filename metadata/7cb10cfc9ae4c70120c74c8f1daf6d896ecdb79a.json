Organized into five parts Ã¢â‚¬â€ the locomotor system, the vertebral column, the lower extremity, the trunk, and the upper extremity, Yogabody covers the body's bones, joints, connective tissue, nerves, and muscles. This valuable guide builds on what yoga teachers already know and enables them to quickly decide what might help their students move with more enjoyment and less difficulty. It helps yoga students understand how their own body functions. Packed with color anatomical drawings, black-and-white diagrammatic asana illustrations, and helpful charts, Yogabody is the Gray's Anatomy for yoga teachers and students.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cb10cfc9ae4c70120c74c8f1daf6d896ecdb79a","amp;dn":"Yogabody%3A+Anatomy%2C+Kinesiology%2C+and+Asana","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cb10cfc9ae4c70120c74c8f1daf6d896ecdb79a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,177,12,252,154,228,199,1,32,199,76,143,29,175,109,137,110,205,183,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
