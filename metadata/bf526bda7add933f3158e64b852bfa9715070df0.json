The question is provoked by the recording career of Arlo Guthrie, which is best remembered for three songs in three different contexts. There is &quot;The City of New Orleans,&quot; Guthrie's only Top 40 hit, which earns him an entry in Wayne Jancik's The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders. There is also &quot;Coming into Los Angeles,&quot; which Guthrie sang at the legendary Woodstock music festival, and which featured prominently in both the Woodstock movie and multi-platinum soundtrack album. And there is &quot;Alice's Restaurant Massacree,&quot; the comic-monologue-in-song that gave him his initial fame and took up the first side of his debut LP, the million-selling Alice's Restaurant. Whether these successful tracks make him a one-, two-, or three-hit wonder, they were arguably both flukes in a performing career that was still going strong a full 40 years after Guthrie first gained national recognition and facilitators of that career. With their help, he spent 15 years signed to a major record label, charting 11 LPs, after which he was able to set up his own label and go on issuing albums. More significant, he maintained a steady following as a live performer, touring worldwide year after year to play before audiences delighted by his humorous persona and his musical mixture of folk, rock, country, blues, and gospel styles in songs almost equally divided between his own originals and well-chosen cover tunes.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nReleased:\t\t1972\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.Anytime\n02.The City Of New Orleans\n03.Lightning Bar Blues\n04.Shackles And Chains\n05.1913 Massacre\n06.Somebody Turned On The Light\n07.Ukulele Lady\n08.When The Ship Comes In\n09.Mapleview (20%) Rag\n10.Days Are Short\n11.Hobo's Lullaby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf526bda7add933f3158e64b852bfa9715070df0","amp;dn":"Arlo+Guthrie+-+Hobo%5C%27s+Lullaby+%281997%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf526bda7add933f3158e64b852bfa9715070df0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,82,107,218,122,221,147,63,49,88,230,75,133,43,250,151,21,7,13,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
