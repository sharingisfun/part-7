It comprised four episodes, each 45 minutes long, and was broadcast only once. The title is a reference to &quot;If you see Sid, tell him&quot;, the slogan used for the sale of shares in British Gas plc.\n\nThe series followed the character of Godfrey Spry, played by Briers. As he is standing outside the post office, a wheelbarrow full of building rubble falls on top of him, causing serious physical injuries (from which he recovers) and leaving him with a greatly reduced attention span. As a result, he spends most of his time watching television commercials, and believes every claim made by them. After seeing an advert for a car, he proceeds to copy it by test driving the same car at high speed along the top of a cliff at sunset, the resultant accident leaving him paralysed.\n\nHe convinces his wife to take a relaxing break with him in Hamburg, which he describes to the viewer in idyllic terms before casually mentioning that on the last night his wife &quot;popped out [of the hotel] for a packet of cough sweets and was stoned to death by a mob of drunken soccer fans&quot;. This entire backstory is played out very early in episode one, with the main part of the show starting with Godfrey calling his nephew Gordon for help after his wife's death.\n\nEvery episode was punctuated by deadpan parody advertisements for fictional products and companies, often juxtaposing the idealistic view of the adverts with the far bleaker reality. Much of the humour of the show derived from Godfrey's cheery interpretations of unpleasant events and circumstances. One memorable scene involves him cheerfully passing a group of people outside his neighbour's flat, blissfully unaware that he has driven the man to suicide, attributing the man's disappearance to him moving up the property ladder.\nIn the last episode, after seeing government advertisements promoting free-enterprise, Godfrey sets up his own business in Gordon and Muriel's house, hiring an elderly woman he met in hospital to knit tea-cosies in the shed. When she falls dead of a heart attack Godfrey attempts to perform a post mortem, which he believes himself to be an expert in after purchasing a partwork of Complete Medical Knowledge. As a result, he is arrested for murder.\n\nAt the trial his nephew Gordon makes an impassioned plea, claiming that it is not Godfrey who should be on trial but the advertisers who are murdering all of our minds.\n\n\nI didn't rip this, I downloaded it from dailymotion. But I'm uploading it because it isn't available on bittorrent and calling it a DVDRip because that is all it could be (given the rarity).\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 141 MiB\nDuration                                 : 42mn 51s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 459 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4b092a382e2722252e0b0779657a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : No\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 3 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 42mn 51s\nBit rate                                 : 392 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 480 pixels\nHeight                                   : 360 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.091\nStream size                              : 120 MiB (85%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2431 a5831aa\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 42mn 51s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 64.0 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                         : 440 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz / 22.05 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 19.6 MiB (14%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3621ee3fbe138a68e5ac42ce2d3d0dea3cab43a","amp;dn":"If+You+See+God%2C+Tell+Him+%281993%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3621ee3fbe138a68e5ac42ce2d3d0dea3cab43a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,98,30,227,251,225,56,166,142,90,196,44,226,211,208,222,163,202,180,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
