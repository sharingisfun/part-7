But lying low and keeping out of his hunters' gunsights is getting harder to do since he started earning a serious rep at the poker tableâ€”and especially now that he's made some new friends . . . named Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, and Doc Holliday.In Denver, Butler finds Holliday in the clutches of corrupt lawmen. Doc's wanted for murder back in Tombstone, and he'd rather go out in a blazing gunfight than face an Arizona hanging judge. All Butler has to do is keep Doc breathing until Earp and Masterson arrive to spring himâ€”and that won't be easy. The Gambler's been dealt into a dangerous game with too many killers anteing up.
