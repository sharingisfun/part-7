The studio follow-up to the hugely successful Powerslave/Live After Death pair, it was the first Iron Maiden album to feature guitar synthesizers.\n\nSince its release, it has been certified platinum by the RIAA, having sold over 1,000,000 copies in the US alone.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1. \t&quot;Caught Somewhere in Time&quot;   \t  \t\n2. \t&quot;Wasted Years&quot;   \t\n3. \t&quot;Sea of Madness&quot;  \n4. \t&quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;   \t  \t\n5. \t&quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot;  \n6. \t&quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;   \n7. \t&quot;Deja-Vu&quot;   \n8. \t&quot;Alexander the Great&quot; \n\nThis was the first Maiden album that I owned. I got this on cassette back in 1986 and since then I became an Iron Maiden fan. I own every Maiden album and in my opinion is one of the best Metal bands on the planet today. This is my favorite Maiden album and my favorite songs are Wasted Years, Sea Of Madness, Stranger In A Strange Land and Alexander The Great. If you like this band support it and buy at least some of their albums. They deserve it. I have tons of Maiden Material and I'll be uploading more soon.\n\nEnjoy and seed. Also comment please.  \t \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b6918f0c675cfbc4c1779a7e54158668803c15c","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+Somewhere+In+Time+256kbps+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b6918f0c675cfbc4c1779a7e54158668803c15c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,105,24,240,198,117,207,188,76,23,121,167,229,65,88,102,136,3,193,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
