rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.blackbeltmag.com/daily/martial-arts-entertainment/martial-art-movies/top-20-martial-arts-films-of-all-time/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSMA was likely released following Men From the Monastery. Although some people describe SMA as slow, a few points should be considered.\n Firstly, SMA was released in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and elsewhere during the post-Bruce Lee era. Filmmakers in HK and audiences were looking for the next big thing. Obviously, during this time came many Bruce Lee exploitation films starring various BL imitators.\n But some other filmmakers chose to go a different route; some chose to explore how to adapt classical Chinese martial arts styles for the screen, for the first time in a way that would highlight the defining characteristics of these arts.\n Exaggerated, of course, but in an entertaining way. These films influenced the proliferation of &quot;shapes&quot; or stylistic characteristics, in 1970s Kung fu movies.\n\nSecondly, this film was made during the era before the use of quick-cuts, CGI, etc. And these Shaolin cycle films also avoided using under cranking to artificially speed up the action.\n All films in the cycle except for the last two were martial arts choreographed by the team of Tang Chia and Liu Chia-Liang (Cantonese: Lau Kar-Leung), who were and are actual Kung fu masters.\n\nThirdly, SMA was the first onscreen introduction of a few new faces who later became major stars in HK cinema: Wang Lung-Wei, Liang Chia-Jen (Leung Kar-Yan) as the two main villains, and Gordon Liu as one of the protagonists.\n The lead stars are the late Alexander Fu Sheng and Chi Kuan-Chun, who were teamed together in most of the Shaolin cycle films except Heroes Two. Their divergent looks and personalities, as well as their excellent Kung fu skills, made them a great onscreen duo.\n\nSMA was not the first Kung fu film to feature training sequences, but it was the first to center the movie around them. And more than most, it depicts the often long, slow process and drudgery that kung fu training entailed. There are no trampolines or wire work here.\n SMA features the separate training cycles of not one or two, but four men (not only Fu Sheng and Chi Kuan-Chun, but also Gordon Liu and Tang Yen-Tsan).\n Also worth noting is that Chi Kuan-Chun and Fu Sheng's training sequences in this film are the obvious inspiration for the training scenes in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 2.\n\nIf you are expecting a fast-paced film full of special effects, wire work, fast editing, etc., SMA may not appeal to you. If you enjoy the torturous process that heroes must endure in order to defeat overwhelming odds, in this case, two villains of near-invincible abilities, then you may want to give it a try.\n Although the choreography isn't as fast as later films, it is nonetheless excellent and clear to see. The pace of this film may be likened to some of the 1960s-era Japanese samurai films, which were, in fact, major inspirations for Chang Cheh.\n It definitely holds an important place in history in the martial arts movie genre.\nSMA is one of my all-time favorites and holds a special place in my collection.\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/VzazftV&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/VzazftV&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is personally brought to you by the Carjacker, from The Chop Shop.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
