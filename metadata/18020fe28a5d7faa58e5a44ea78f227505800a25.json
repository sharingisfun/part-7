Scientists, archaeologists, and historians alike search for evidence of cities that may have forever been lost to time. Some are ancient while some are surprisingly recent. Journey back to Jerusalem when Christ walked through its streets. Explore the mysteries of the Knights Templar. See Egypt when Ramses ruled and discover what it looked like in Braveheart's Scotland. Recent cities include Winston Churchill's secret bunkers and a Welthauptstadt Germania that Hitler envisioned. Graphic recreations and location shots bring these cities to life.\n\n\n\n\n12)  Hitlers Supercity \nOn the outskirts of Berlin stand traces of the Supercity that Adolph Hitler planned. Forgotten and abandoned, they are what remain of his attempt to build a new world capital. Hitler may have been responsible for more death and destruction than any individual in history, but he didn't only want to destroy, he wanted to build, to remodel his country according to his own vision. And this new city would be the project's showpiece. Hitler planned to create buildings bigger and better than anything that had gone before. A domed hall so large that the Eiffel Tower could be fitted inside it. A stadium that would hold 400,000 people. But his dream was never fully realized and it died with him at the end of World War II. Only now after six decades of research and using new computer graphic technology is it possible to recreate the city that Hitler had intended for his people. This is Hitler's lost world.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/4539/lostworldsseries1screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/4539/lostworldsseries1screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/4539/lostworldsseries1screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/4539/lostworldsseries1screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/4539/lostworldsseries1screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/4539/lostworldsseries1screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/4539/lostworldsseries1screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/4539/lostworldsseries1screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/4539/lostworldsseries1screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/4539/lostworldsseries1screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/4539/lostworldsseries1screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/4539/lostworldsseries1screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a3ebcac4cbe3ef978d93&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 1854 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 464\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 46mins\n * Frame rate: 23fps\n * Number of Parts: 13\n * Part Size: 638 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Worlds_%28TV_series%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Worlds_%28TV_series%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18020fe28a5d7faa58e5a44ea78f227505800a25","amp;dn":"History+Ch+Lost+Worlds+Series+1+12of13+Hitlers+Supercity+DVDrip+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18020fe28a5d7faa58e5a44ea78f227505800a25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,2,15,226,138,93,127,170,88,229,164,78,167,143,34,117,5,128,10,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
