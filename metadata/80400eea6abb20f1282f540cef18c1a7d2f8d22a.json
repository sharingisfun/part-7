Mikis Theodorakis - Serpico (O.S.T.) (1973)\n\nThe original music written by Mikis Theodorakis for the film Sidney Lumet &quot;Serpico&quot;. \nThe movie (with Al Pacino), made great sense when released. The director had heard the music of Mikis Theodorakis and certainly like the music of his film to be written by Greek composer. \nThe Mikis Theodorakis inspired the music of the film while it was on tour and recorded in a studio in New York. \nFor the record used Philharmonic musicians and the best jazz soloists.\n\n\n01. Theme From Serpico \n02. Honest Cop \n03. Alone In The Apartment \n04. Meeting In The Park \n05. Shoe Shop \n06. On The Streets \n07. Flashback \n08. Laurie's Fable \n09. Disillusion \n10. End Of Title\n\n\n\n\n5. Mikis Theodorakis - State Of Siege (OST) (1973)\n\nSelective affinities and a different perception of a political background compose the soundtrack written by Mikis Theodorakis for the needs of the Costa Gavras film\n ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½State Of SiegeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½. \nThe first part concerns the style of the compositions very reminiscent of the Canto General, work on which was working at that time (1972) in Paris, the Greek composer. \nThe second refers to the fact that the director thought the ToupamarosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ fight as deadend, while the Greek musician wrote the themes with idealistic romantic mood. This different perspective ultimately led to ... scissors. \nA large part of the music was removed from the film because Gavras considered that the epic of style would give the viewer a sense other than that originally had in mind. \n Here are including the nine areas earmarked for the film. \nRecorded in Paris at Christmas 1972 and the musicians of the orchestra of M. Theodorakis accompany the Chilean band Los Calchakis, contributing decisively to the sound and tone of the total score. (in.gr)\n\n\n01. State Of Siege \n02. Pueblo En Lucha \n03. Paola. 11,099 \n04.
