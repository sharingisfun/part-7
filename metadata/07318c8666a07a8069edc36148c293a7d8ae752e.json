We'll then explore the nucleus node, which is the heart of the nDynamics system. \nAfterwards, we'll jump into a few project-based lessons and learn how to modify nParticle properties for larger simulations. We'll learn techniques for simulating fire, smoke, and water.\n\nWe'll also learn how to change the physical properties of objects with nCloth, how to set up proxy objects to run simulations faster, how to work with Collision Layers, and how to use nCloth to simulate flesh on characters.\nBy the end of this training, you will have the skills needed to working comfortably with Maya's nDynamics module.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07318c8666a07a8069edc36148c293a7d8ae752e","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Introduction+to+nDynamics+in+Maya","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07318c8666a07a8069edc36148c293a7d8ae752e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,49,140,134,102,160,122,128,105,237,195,97,72,194,147,167,216,174,117,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
