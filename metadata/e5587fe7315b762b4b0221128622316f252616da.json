Among the nine people he lives with are: a \nfather, who is suffering from malnutrition and a fatal illness; a brother, who is a former Nazi soldier hiding to avoid arrest; and a sister, who has turned to \nprostitution. Scouring the rubble-strewn city for food, money, and cigarettes, he \ncomes upon a former teacher, Herr Enning (Erich Guhne), who evinces a barely \nrestrained sexual attraction to the boy while providing him with records of Hitler's speeches that can be bartered on the black market. He also drums into the boy a classic piece of Nazi propaganda about the importance of having the courage to let the weak be destroyed. Under his influence, the confused young protagonist heads down a tragic path.\n\nIMdB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039417/ | Rating: 7.9 / 10 (2,407 votes)\n                                     \nGeneral.\n                                                                  \nComplete name                    :Germany.Year.Zero.1948.CRITERION.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA.mkv\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 1.66 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 13mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 3 250 Kbps\nSource                           : Criterion NTSC DVD9\n                                       \nVideo.                   \n\nFormat                           : AVC\nBit rate                         : 2 992 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 3 062 Kbps\nWidth                            : 664 pixels\nHeight                           : 448 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.420\nStream size                      : 1.52 GiB (92%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 79\n\nAudio.\n\nTrack 1\n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nCodec ID                         : A_AC3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 1 channel\nChannel positions                : C\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 100 MiB (6%)\nLanguage                         : German\n\nSubtitles.\n\nFormat                           : VobSub\nCodec ID                         : S_VOBSUB\nTitle                            : Track 1\nLanguage                         : English\n\nChapters.\n\n00:00:00.000                     : :Chapter 1\n00:03:04.784                     : :Chapter 2\n00:06:41.801                     : :Chapter 3\n00:13:23.569                     : :Chapter 4\n00:16:03.562                     : :Chapter 5\n00:19:09.081                     : :Chapter 6\n00:26:28.520                     : :Chapter 7\n00:29:13.017                     : :Chapter 8\n00:34:57.028                     : :Chapter 9\n00:38:27.238                     : :Chapter 10\n00:43:48.225                     : :Chapter 11\n00:47:06.757                     : :Chapter 12\n00:50:03.567                     : :Chapter 13\n00:52:39.589                     : :Chapter 14\n00:56:28.718                     : :Chapter 15\n00:58:14.757                     : :Chapter 16\n01:05:22.184                     : :Chapter 17\n01:09:07.910                     : :Chapter 18\n01:13:00.893                     : :Chapter 19\n\nKARiNA.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5587fe7315b762b4b0221128622316f252616da","amp;dn":"Germany.Year.Zero.1948.CRITERION.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5587fe7315b762b4b0221128622316f252616da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,88,127,231,49,91,118,43,75,2,33,18,134,34,49,111,37,38,22,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
