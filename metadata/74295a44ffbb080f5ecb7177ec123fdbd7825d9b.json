Lorenzo Da Ponte (Lorenzo Balducci) is a defrocked priest who, after a failed marriage and a spell running a brothel, has found himself in Vienna, where his gifts as a poet and friendship with Casanova (Tobias Moretti) have led to an introduction to composer Salieri (Ennio Fantastichini). Salieri has been commissioned by the Viennese court to write an opera and is in need of a lyricist. Da Ponte agrees to write the libretto for Salieri's latest project, but when the composer becomes disinterested, he passes the opera on to one of his associates, Mozart (Lino Guanciale). As Da Ponte juggles both serious and casual relationships with several women and Mozart struggles with his muse, their adventures become a reflection of the story Da Ponte and Mozart are setting to music.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Io, Don Giovanni.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,466,402,532 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:01:31\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.0 Final\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x320 (AR: 2.000)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1215 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.237 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 384 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458515/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458515/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nItalian audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nCarlos Saura - Io, Don Giovanni (2009)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74295a44ffbb080f5ecb7177ec123fdbd7825d9b","amp;dn":"Carlos+Saura+-+Io%2C+Don+Giovanni+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74295a44ffbb080f5ecb7177ec123fdbd7825d9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,41,90,68,255,187,8,15,94,203,113,119,236,18,63,219,215,130,93,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
