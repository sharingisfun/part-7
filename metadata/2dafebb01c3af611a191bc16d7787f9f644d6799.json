A harmony-vocal angel on Lou Reed's 2003 tour, Antony stole the encore each night, kissing anguished life into the Velvet Underground sigh &amp;quot;Candy Says.&amp;quot; His soft but dogged longing for transformation in that song illuminates the whole of his second album. I Am a Bird Now opens with the full-force yearning of Antony's falsetto fluttering over stern gospel piano in &amp;quot;Hope There's Someone.&amp;quot; In &amp;quot;Fistful of Love,&amp;quot; his voice cuts through distortion-hell guitar (played by Reed) and roughhouse brass like a glass spear. Even in duets with Rufus Wainwright (wonderfully languid in &amp;quot;What Can I Do?&amp;quot;) and Boy George, Antony is the dominant voice of solitude and agonized waiting. &amp;quot;One day I'll grow up and feel the power in me,&amp;quot; he sings in &amp;quot;For Today I Am a Boy,&amp;quot; a song only partly about the trap of gender. The lesson in this magnificence: That day has come.\n\nDAVID FRICKE\n(Posted feb 10, 2005)\n\nhttp://www.antonyandthejohnsons.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dafebb01c3af611a191bc16d7787f9f644d6799","amp;dn":"Anthony+and+The+Johnsons+-+I%5C%27m+a+Bird+Now+%40192","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dafebb01c3af611a191bc16d7787f9f644d6799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,175,235,176,28,58,246,17,161,145,188,22,215,120,127,159,100,77,103,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
