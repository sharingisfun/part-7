It is a special night for noted astronomer Ted Lewis, who is preparing\na special dinner for his beautiful, adoring wife Lana to celebrate their\nwedding anniversary. In another part of town, Tammy, a waitress at small\nlocal diner with big plans for the future, looks out her window and is excited\nto see a shooting star, which she takes as a good sign for her dreams. But,\nwhat Dr. Lewis and Tammy assume is a shooting star, is really an alien\nspaceship. The fiery ball hurtles toward earth and crash-lands on a butte in\nthe desert. The only witnesses are teens Dick and Penny who are necking in a\nnearby lover's lane. A tall, metallic alien named Urp emerges from the craft\nunharmed, alarmed to discover that the monstrous Ghota, who was also on board\nhas escaped. The menacing one-eyed creature's unquenchable appetite could\nmean the end of civilization as we know it. Urp is the only one who knows how\nto stop the hideous extra-terrestrial, but to do so he has to take over the\nbody of Dr. Lewis and enlist the aid of Tammy, the only human in town willing\nto believe and trust in his mission. The local police - including Chief\nDawson and Officer Vern - are confirmed skeptics and offer little help.\nTogether, Urp and Tammy must hunt down the Ghota and neutralize it before it\nconsumes all the local inhabitants and uses the human fuel to multiply and\nconquer the world!\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Eric McCormack.\n=&gt;-Jenni Baird.\n=&gt;-Robert Patrick.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-R W Goodwin.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Comedy : Horror : Sci-Fi.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2009.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.05 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1666 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 24mn.\n=&gt;-Alien Trespass.............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alien_trespass/\n=&gt;-Alien Trespass.............: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/alien-trespass/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 16:9.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 720 x 400.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1784 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 224 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b7e0d56edd0eaf025d4e478631fc76b17a32cfd","amp;dn":"Alien+Trespass+-+Horror+Sci-Fi+2009+Eng+Subs+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b7e0d56edd0eaf025d4e478631fc76b17a32cfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,126,13,86,237,208,234,240,37,212,228,120,99,31,199,107,23,163,44,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
