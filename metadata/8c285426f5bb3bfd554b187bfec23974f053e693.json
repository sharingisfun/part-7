The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c285426f5bb3bfd554b187bfec23974f053e693","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+4+-+9.023+-+English+-+Install+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c285426f5bb3bfd554b187bfec23974f053e693","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,40,84,38,245,187,59,253,85,75,24,123,254,194,57,116,240,83,230,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
