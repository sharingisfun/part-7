The times they are a-changin'\n\nThis is their third studio effort together (following Scofield A Go Go and Out Louder), dating back to 1997. Juice will feature five new originals from the quartet plus four covers, including Bob DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin'&quot; and CreamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;. This time around, the quartet is looking to explore more Afro-Latin rhythms, which seems rather interesting but pretty much everything is interesting with this super talented group of musicians","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbb17e2431c9dede01cdf2abda17f4003180b379","amp;dn":"Medeski%2C+Scofield%2C+Martin+%26amp%3B+Wood+-+Juice+%5B2014+Jazz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbb17e2431c9dede01cdf2abda17f4003180b379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,177,126,36,49,201,222,222,1,205,242,171,218,23,244,0,49,128,179,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
