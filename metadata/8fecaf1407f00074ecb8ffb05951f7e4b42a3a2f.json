A special effort has been made to impart an appreciation for the rich history behind current activities in the field.\n\nProfusely illustrated and exhaustively referenced and cross-referenced, The Computer Music Tutorial provides a step-by-step introduction to the entire field of computer music techniques. Written for nontechnical as well as technical readers, it uses hundreds of charts, diagrams, screen images, and photographs as well as clear explanations to present basic concepts and terms. Mathematical notation and program code examples are used only when absolutely necessary. Explanations are not tied to any specific software or hardware.\n\nCurtis Roads has served as editor-in-chief of Computer Music Journal for more than a decade and is a recognized authority in the field. The material in this book was compiled and refined over a period of several years of teaching in classes at Harvard University, Oberlin Conservatory, the University of Naples, IRCAM, Les Ateliers UPIC, and in seminars and workshops in North America, Europe, and Asia.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fecaf1407f00074ecb8ffb05951f7e4b42a3a2f","amp;dn":"The+Computer+Music+Tutorial+++by+Curtis+Roads.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fecaf1407f00074ecb8ffb05951f7e4b42a3a2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,236,175,20,7,240,0,116,236,184,255,176,89,81,247,228,180,42,58,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
