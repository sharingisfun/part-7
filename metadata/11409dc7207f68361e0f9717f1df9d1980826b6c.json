In early 1900s Paris, poor Polish student Marie (Greer Garson) gets a chance to study magnetism with kindly professor Jean Perot (Albert Basserman). Perot also arranges for the shy scientist Pierre Curie (Walter Pidgeon) to share the lab with Marie. As they work together, Pierre and Marie fall in love. Pierre eventually musters up the courage to ask her to marry him, and she accepts. After their honeymoon, Marie becomes obsessed with a piece of pitchblende that has been displaying some peculiar properties. After five years of work, Marie discovers radium. But as the years go on, Marie and Pierre struggle to raise money to continue their research, hoping to one day be able to isolate radium from the pitchblende.\n \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036126/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036126/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Curie_(1943_film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Curie_(1943_film)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSubs:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.5sub.com/movie.aspx?m=ef2fc01c-a203-4fb8-82e2-0a6dfa4a2c19&amp;k=madame&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.5sub.com/movie.aspx?m=ef2fc01c-a203-4fb8-82e2-0a6dfa4a2c19&amp;k=madame&lt;/a&gt; curie\n\n\nAwards:Nominated for 7 Oscars\n\n\nDirector:Mervyn LeRoy\n\n\n Greer Garson ...
