As many others have commented here over the years, this film is a masterpiece.\n\nLuminous, 23 November 2002 - 10/10\nAuthor: allan825 from Colorado Springs\nLuminous...painterly...haunting...devastating...in terms of both substance and style, a cinematic achievement of the very highest order. Like all great works of art, it is incomparable, although it would not be misleading to place it in the company of the very best of Renoir, Ford, and Kurosawa. It has the same kind of compassionate humanism, high-caliber storytelling, and effortless-seeming mastery of the medium...the same generosity.\n\nA haunting, heartbreaking masterpiece, 24 October 1999\n10/10 - Author: sansho-4 from Seattle, WA\nMan&amp;#039;s inhumanity to man is presented here with no artifice. This has long been a favorite of mine, although it&amp;#039;s difficult to sell many others on the premise -- an honest, benevolent Governor in medieval Japan is imprisoned by the military regime, forcing his wife, son, and daughter to fend for themselves. They are soon captured, separated, and sold into slavery, but remained determined to reunite.\n\nThere&amp;#039;s something about the medieval Japanese setting that lends itself to explorations of grandiose themes painted with a broad brush. This will break your heart, and belongs on your shelf next to &quot;Ran&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8135953ee66ce28d515152d303e9c4d0b8195c7b","amp;dn":"Sansho.the.Bailiff.Dayu.1954.Criterion.dvdrip.xvid.ac3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8135953ee66ce28d515152d303e9c4d0b8195c7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,53,149,62,230,108,226,141,81,81,82,211,3,233,196,208,184,25,92,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
