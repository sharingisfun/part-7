He always (after all these decades) looks boyish, and part of the charm of the series is that a boy is cast into all kinds of serious situations; with innocence and honesty, he deals with a range of criminals and problems and comes out on top. We know nothing about his family; we do know that he lives alone, reads widely, apparently speaks several languages, and is in top physical condition. His fashion sense may leave something to be desired. Of course, he couldn't be so successful without his faithful sidekick, his fox terrier Snowy (Milou in French), whose thought balloons provide a running commentary on the stories. Slapstick comedy mixes with sophisticated satire, as well as political and cultural commentary throughout the stories, and the more you know about history, the more you will appreciate the Tintin stories. \n\nThe books balance Tintin's rather bland personality with a variety of eccentric supporting characters, making some people think of the works of Charles Dickens (HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© claimed to be influenced by Mark Twain) - from Captain Haddock, an alcoholic given to absurd but inoffensive oaths to the Thompson Twins (yep, that's where the musicians got their name), detectives who have as much trouble with the language as with the clues, on to Bianca Castafiore, who (some claim) was based on Maria Callas.\n\nTintin in the Congo, the second book in the series, continues to be controversial both for its protrayal of Africans and for the large number of animals killed. It's hard to try to justify racism, but frankly, it seems tame compared to some US animated cartoons of the time. For his fifth book (The Blue Lotus), HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© collaborated with a Chinese student to avoid perpetuating European mis-perceptions of China. The Dalai Lama has recognized Tintin for making Westerners aware of Tibet in Tintin in Tibet.\n\nAlcoholism, violence against animals, racism - parents, take note. But, everyone take note of the elegant drawing, the careful research either in creating fictitious countries or speculating about space travel. Enjoy these little glimpses into a world that is almost, but not quite, our own.\n\nThese are the books by HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, typically running about 65 pages each. The first two are available here only in black and white. HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© re-drew some of the earlier works and colored them, but I could not find the first two in colored English versions.\n\n\n1.

The following stories were created despite HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s wishes that no one else write Tintin stories, with an X before the numbers to make it clear that these are not part of HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s canon. The Lake of Sharks is based on an animated Tintin cartoon. The Thailand story has Tintin visiting a &quot;boy bar.&quot; Breaking Free is an anarchist tale of Tintin on the dole; available as a series of separate images, it has never before (as far as I know) been compiled into a PDF.\n\n\nX25.
