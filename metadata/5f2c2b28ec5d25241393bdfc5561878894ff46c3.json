His popularity has reached fever pitch. Matt Frei asks: can Trump really go all the way to the White House? As the race to the Oval Office has heated up the billionaire tycoon has continued to spark indignation, been criticised by the Pope and had his rivals question the size of his genitals. Along the way 'the Donald' has won key states and increased his support while some of his rallies have been consumed by mass protests. His position may now be unassailable, as Trump himself puts it: 'I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters'. Frei asks if those who want to stop him have any chance of doing so. Can he beat Hillary Clinton? Can he convince the American voters to sweep his political circus into the top job? America is now waking up to an extraordinary reality: Donald Trump could actually become President.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ad/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c4/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d4/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b6/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3f/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/81/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5a/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/ff/President-Trump-Can-He-Really-Win-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2270Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 46 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 803 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f2c2b28ec5d25241393bdfc5561878894ff46c3","amp;dn":"Ch4+President+Trump+Can+He+Really+Win+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f2c2b28ec5d25241393bdfc5561878894ff46c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,44,43,40,236,93,37,36,19,147,189,252,85,97,135,136,148,255,70,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
