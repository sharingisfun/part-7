Over eight years of study,\nshe\\'s found that, though humans bond with their dogs closely, they\\'re clueless when it comes to understanding what dogs\nperceiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½leading her to the not-inconsequential notion that dogs know us better than we know them.\n\nHorowitz begins by inviting readers into a dog\\'s umweltÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½his worldviewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½by imagining themselves living 18 inches or so above\nthe ground, with incredible olfactory senses comparable to the human capacity for detailed sight in three dimensions (though\ndogs\\' sight, in combination with their sense of smell, may result in a more complex perception of \\&quot;color\\&quot; than humans can\nimagine). Social and communications skills are also explored, as well as the practicalities of dog owning (Horowitz disagrees\nwith the \\&quot;pack\\&quot; approach to dog training).\n\nDog lovers will find this book largely fascinating, despite Horowitz\\'s meandering style and somnolent tone.\\&quot;\n\nIncludes Torrent downloaded from ThePirateBay.org.txt and:\n--\nInside of a Dog - Disk 01 - 11/\n\n     4KB Inside of a Dog - What Dogs See Smell and Know 2009 AudioBook 18MP3 857MB.nfo\n\n    69KB Inside of a Dog - Back Cover.jpg\n   122KB Inside of a Dog - Back Flap.jpg\n    46KB Inside of a Dog - Front Cover.jpg\n   146KB Inside of a Dog - Front Flap.jpg\n    11KB InsideofaDog - Alternate Front Cover.jpg\n\n21,064KB Inside of a Dog - D01 T1 - Inside of Dog.mp3\n13,410KB Inside of a Dog - D01 T2 - A Prefatory Note on the Dog, Training, and Owners.mp3\n61,458KB Inside of a Dog - D01 T3 - Umwelt.mp3\n\n45,458KB Inside of a Dog - D02 T1 - Belong to the House.mp3\n59,074KB Inside of a Dog - D02 T2 - Fancy Dogs.mp3\n\n68,806KB Inside of a Dog - D03 T1 - Sniff.mp3\n\n49,918KB Inside of a Dog - D04 T1 - Mute.mp3\n\n47,066KB Inside of a Dog - D05 T1 - Woof.mp3\n49,778KB Inside of a Dog - D05 T2 - Dog-Eyed.mp3\n\n59,866KB Inside of a Dog - D06 T1 - Seen by a Dog.mp3\n37,614KB Inside of a Dog - D06 T2 - Canine Anthropologists.mp3\n\n46,644KB Inside of a Dog - D07 T1 - Noble Mind.mp3\n50,824KB Inside of a Dog - D07 T2 - Theory of Mind.mp3\n\n77,416KB Inside of a Dog - D08 T1 - Inside of a Dog.mp3\n\n71,146KB Inside of a Dog - D09 T1 - A Dogs Age.mp3\n\n70,716KB Inside of a Dog - D10 T1 - You Had Me at Hello.mp3\n\n39,296KB Inside of a Dog - D11 T1 - The Importance of Mornings.mp3\n 8,116KB Inside of a Dog - D11 T2 - Postscript - Me and My Dog.mp3\n\n     1KB Torrent downloaded from ThePirateBay.org.txt\n\nTotal Files Listed:\n 25 Files, 11 Directories\n857MB\t(878,480KB\t899,563,434 bytes)\n--\n\nShare and enjoy.\nEef.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d6d9794aa57989967586c68dcc95a686e3455ff","amp;dn":"Inside+of+a+Dog+-+What+Dogs+See+Smell+and+Know+2009+AudioBook+18","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d6d9794aa57989967586c68dcc95a686e3455ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,109,151,148,170,87,152,153,103,88,108,104,220,201,90,104,110,52,85,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
