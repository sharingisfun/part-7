Needing to pay elder care for his mother, Victor has devised an ingenious scam: he pretends to choke on pieces of food while dining in upscale restaurants. He then allows himself to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“savedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by fellow patrons who, feeling responsible for VictorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, go on to send checks to support him. When heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not pulling this stunt, Victor cruises sexual addiction recovery workshops for action, visits his addled mom, and spends his days working at a colonial theme park. His creator, Chuck Palahniuk, is the visionary we need and the satirist we deserve.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b96dab47eb31824d81d6789d24f0162b2beb817f","amp;dn":"Choke+-+Chuck+Palahniuk.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b96dab47eb31824d81d6789d24f0162b2beb817f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,109,171,71,235,49,130,77,129,214,120,157,36,240,22,43,43,235,129,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
