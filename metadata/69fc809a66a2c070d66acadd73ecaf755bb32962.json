This text focuses on the first three types of questions and covers basic counting and existence principles, distributions, generating functions, recurrence relations, PÃƒÂ³lya theory, combinatorial designs, error correcting codes, partially ordered sets, and selected applications to graph theory including the enumeration of trees, the chromatic polynomial, and introductory Ramsey theory.\n\nThe only prerequisites are single-variable calculus and familiarity with sets and basic proof techniques. It is flexible enough to be used for undergraduate courses in combinatorics, second courses in discrete mathematics, introductory graduate courses in applied mathematics programs, as well as for independent study or reading courses. It also features approximately 350 reading questions spread throughout its eight chapters. These questions provide checkpoints for learning and prepare the reader for the end-of-section exercises of which there are over 470.\n\nContents\n========\n\n Part I.

Mazur is Associate Professor of Mathematics at Western New England College in Springfield, Massachusetts. He was born on October 23, 1971 in Washington, D.C. He received his undergraduate degree in Mathematics from the University of Delaware in 1993, and also won the Department of Mathematical Sciences' William D. Clark prize for 'unusual ability' in the major that year. He then received two fellowships for doctoral study in the Department of Mathematical Sciences (now the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics) at The Johns Hopkins University. From there he received his Master's in 1996 and his Ph.D. in 1999 under the direction of Leslie A. Hall, focusing on operations research, integer programming, and polyhedral combinatorics.
