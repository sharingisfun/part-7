I noticed that there wasn't a single torrent of this movie that had been encoded in x264 - every torrent listed that I saw was encoded using the obsolete XviD format, so I decided the file sharing community could a version in the more efficient x264, with a smaller file size.\n\nKids is a 1995 American drama film written by Harmony Korine and directed by Larry Clark. The film features Chloe Sevigny, Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce and Rosario Dawson, most of them in their debut performances. The film is centered on a day in the life of a group of sexually active teenagers in New York City and their unrestrained behavior towards sex and drugs during the era of HIV in the mid-1990s.\n\nKids created considerable controversy upon its release in 1995, and caused much public debate over its artistic merit, even receiving an NC-17 rating from the MPAA. It was later released without a rating.\n\nBitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.\n\nPlease note that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on &quot;normal&quot; sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have limited hard drive space to work with. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you may need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.\n\nPlease seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a35cc6b218597ddce7ed8ae951335ea64e60b1b0","amp;dn":"Kids+%281995%29+%5B480p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a35cc6b218597ddce7ed8ae951335ea64e60b1b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,92,198,178,24,89,125,220,231,237,138,233,81,51,94,166,78,96,177,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
