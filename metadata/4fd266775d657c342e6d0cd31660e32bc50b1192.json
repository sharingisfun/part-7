In late-medieval France, a country devastated by the Black Death, torn by civil strife, and strained by the Hundred YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s War with England, the notion of pain shifted within the conceptual frameworks provided by theology and medicine. Performing Bodies in Pain analyzes the cultural work of spectacular suffering during these two periods, reading recent dramatizations of torture and performances of self-mutilating conceptual art against late-medieval saint plays.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fd266775d657c342e6d0cd31660e32bc50b1192","amp;dn":"Performing+Bodies+in+Pain+-+Medieval+and+Post-Modern+Martyrs%2C+My","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fd266775d657c342e6d0cd31660e32bc50b1192","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,210,102,119,93,101,124,52,46,109,12,211,22,96,227,43,197,11,17,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
