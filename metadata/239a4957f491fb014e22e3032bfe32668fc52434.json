Following the disbanding of bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard's previous group Mother Love Bone, the two recruited vocalist Eddie Vedder, guitarist Mike McCready, and drummer Dave Krusen to form Pearl Jam in 1990. Most of the songs began as instrumental jams, to which Vedder added lyrics about topics such as depression, homelessness, and abuse. Ten was not an immediate success, but by late 1992 it had reached number two on the Billboard 200 chart. The album produced three hit singles: &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Even Flow&quot;, and &quot;Jeremy&quot;. While Pearl Jam was accused of jumping on the grunge bandwagon at the time, Ten was instrumental in popularizing alternative rock in the mainstream. The album has been certified thirteen times platinum by the RIAA in the United States and remains Pearl Jam's most successful album. As of April 2009, Ten has sold 9.6 million copies in the United States\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Once\n[02] Even Flow\n[03] Alive\n[04] Why Go\n[05] Black\n[06] Jeremy\n[07] Oceans\n[08] Porch\n[09] Garden\n[10] Deep\n[11] Release\n[12] Alive [Live]\n[13] Wash\n[14] Dirty Frank \n\n\n\n\nTotal Play Time\t&gt; 01h:07m:22s\n\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 164mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Grunge Rock\n\nReleased  \t&gt; 27 August 1991\n\nRecord Company\t&gt; Sony Music\n\nArtists Website\t&gt; \n\n[url]http://www.pearljam.com[/url] \n\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Jam[/url] \n[url]http://twitter.com/PearlJam[/url] \n[url]http://twitter.com/PearlJam[/url]\n[url]http://www.ilike.com/artist/Pearl+Jam[/url]\n[url]http://www.azlyrics.com/p/pearljam.html[/url]\n[url]http://www.muzu.tv/pearljam[/url] \n\n \n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:239a4957f491fb014e22e3032bfe32668fc52434","amp;dn":"%5B1992%5D+Ten+-+Pearl+Jam+-+164mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"239a4957f491fb014e22e3032bfe32668fc52434","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,154,73,87,244,145,251,1,78,34,227,3,43,254,50,102,143,197,36,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
