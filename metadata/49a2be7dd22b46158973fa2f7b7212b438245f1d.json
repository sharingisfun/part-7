Here is a book about nesting ospreys, multiple universes, atheism, spiritualism, and the arrow of time. Throughout, Lightman takes us back and forth between ordinary occurrencesÃ¢â‚¬â€old shoes and entropy, sailing far out at sea and the infinite expanse of space.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In this slight volume, Lightman looks toward the universe and captures aspects of it in a series of beautifully written essays, each offering a glimpse at the whole from a different perspective: here time, there symmetry, not least God. It is a meditation by a remarkable humanist-physicist, a book worth reading by anyone entranced by big ideas grounded in the physical world.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n Ã¢â‚¬â€Peter L. Galison, Joseph Pellegrino University Professor, Harvard University\n\nepub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49a2be7dd22b46158973fa2f7b7212b438245f1d","amp;dn":"The+Accidental+Universe%3A+The+World+You+Thought+You+Knew+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49a2be7dd22b46158973fa2f7b7212b438245f1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,162,190,125,210,43,70,21,137,115,250,47,123,114,18,180,56,36,95,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
