Mia's always been the glamorous one, the one everyone wants to get close to. And now she's a model, on the edge of fame. But Mia can't resist the illegal thrills that come with fame. When disaster strikes, her mousy look-alike sister has to pretend to be Mia. Michelle saves her career, and turns out to have star quality too. She's even got someone to fall in love with her - a man Mia wants almost as much as she wants to be a supermodel. That's something Mia will never, ever forgive ..\n================\n\nDovah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de35c31e756f150c09a3e50d910b4e48c5a2e711","amp;dn":"Mandasue+Heller%2C+Two+Faced+%28best+seller%29+epub+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de35c31e756f150c09a3e50d910b4e48c5a2e711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,53,195,30,117,111,21,12,9,163,229,13,145,11,78,72,197,162,231,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
