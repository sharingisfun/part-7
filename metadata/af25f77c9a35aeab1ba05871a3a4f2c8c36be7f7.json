Perhaps even more of this could be seen in the great samples\nof bonus material from Sarah Brightman and one selection in particular from\nThe ten Tenors as Il Divo could do at least as well if not far better, as\nthey already prove it in much of their singing in the song selections below,\nas it is in fact &quot;right up their own alley to do&quot; The voices at times are\nslightly at times seeming even perhaps somewhat momentarily dissonant \nto an extent in that their personalities vary to the extreme in the level\nof true virility and strength of character and spirit of genuine form. Then\nfor most of the remaining they remain beautifully in harmony. We need a lot\nmore of Il Divo styled groups and they might even take to doing more English\nmaterial in English style of efficacy rather than as a tourism experience\nfrom their mainstay as it is their voice that is important since its once \nagain the inflection of the human spirit into our consciousness of the most\ntrue and sincere nature that the human race, the human spirit yearns for more\nnow than ever in our existence I should say.\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo\n\n\n320k mp3s converted from flac to full stereo \n\nThis is billed as a discography however we subtracted their Christmas\nalbum to give them something to sell (or post separately for selective \nchoice perhaps).\n\nGreat list of song selections to sing:\n\nIl Divo - (I Cant live) if living is without you (Desde el dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a que te fuiste) (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Adagio (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - All By Myself (Solo Otra Vez) (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Amazing Grace (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Angelina (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Caruso (Lucio Dalla composition) (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Come primavera (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Dentro Un Altro Si (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - En Aranjuez Con Tu Amor (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Enamorado (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Esisti Dentro Me (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Every Time I Look At You (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Feelings (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Hallelujah (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Hasta Mi Final (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Have you ever really loved a woman (Un regalo que te diÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ la vida) (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Heroe (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Hoy Que Ya No Estas Aqui (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - I Believe In You (Je Crois En Tois) [with Ms. Celine Dion] (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Isabel (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - L'alba Del Mondo (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - La Luna (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - La Promessa (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - La vida sin amor (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Mama (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Musica (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - My Way (A mi manera) (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Nella Fantasia (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Nights in white satin (Notte di luce) (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Passera (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Pour Que Tu M'aimes Encore (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Sei Parte Ormai Di Me (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - She (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Si TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº Me Amas (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Somewhere (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Tell that to my heart (Amor venme a buscar) (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - The Man You Love (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - The Power Of Love (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - The Winner Takes It All (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Ti Amero (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Una noche (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Unbreak My Heart (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - Unchained Melody (from FLAC to mp3)\nIl Divo - You raise me up (Por tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ serÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©) (from FLAC to mp3)\n\n\n\nHeres are some comments about this group posted at wikipedia:\n\nIl Divo (&quot;divine male performer&quot; in Italian) is a multinational operatic\npop vocal group created by music manager, executive, and reality TV star\nSimon Cowell. Formed in the United Kingdom, they are also signed to Cowell's\nrecord label, Syco Music.[1] Il Divo is a group of four male singers: Spanish\nbaritone Carlos MarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n, Swiss tenor Urs BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hler, American tenor David Miller, and\nFrench pop singer SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©bastien Izambard. To date, they have sold more than 26\nmillion albums worldwide\n\n\nThe idea behind Il Divo's creation came to Cowell after hearing Andrea Bocelli \nsinging Con te partirÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² while watching The Sopranos. Aware of this new appreciation \nfor lyrical voices and classical music, he decided to form a multinational quartet \n(the members hail from Spain, Switzerland, France, and the United States, the name \nbeing in Italian) that tried to recreate the style of The Three Tenors.\n\nSimon Cowell conducted a worldwide search for young singers who were willing to \nembark on the Il Divo project, which lasted two years, from 2001 until December \n2003, when the fourth member of Il Divo, American tenor David Miller, was signed. \nThe well-established formation of Il Divo comprises a renowned Spanish baritone, \nCarlos MarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n; two classically trained tenors, Swiss Urs BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hler and American David \nMiller; and a French pop singer, SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©bastien Izambard.\n\n\nRecording started in the first half of 2004 in Sweden, with producers Quiz &amp; Larossi, Per Magnusson &amp; David Kreuger and in the UK with producer Steve Mac. This self-titled album contained the Spanish rendition of Toni Braxton's hit &quot;Unbreak My Heart&quot; (Regresa a MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­), (Braxton had originally released &quot;Regresa a Mi&quot; as a b-side to her 1996 single, &quot;Unbreak My Heart&quot;); their second single and first original song &quot;Mama&quot;; Sinatra's &quot;My Way&quot; (A mi manera); &quot;Nella Fantasia,&quot; and 1994's San Remo Festival winner &quot;PasserÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â .&quot;\n\nThe album hit the #1 slot on both Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com\n\nThis was recorded in both Sweden and London with producers Per Magnusson, David Kreuger and Steve Mac, who were also the producers of their first album. Released on 7 November 2005 in the UK, it hit number one both in the UK and Australia within one week. Ancora was released in the US on 24 January 2006. It entered the Billboard albums chart at number 1, selling more than 150,000 copies during its first week of sales.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af25f77c9a35aeab1ba05871a3a4f2c8c36be7f7","amp;dn":"Il+Divo+Latin+Latino+Tenors+4CD+Compilation+320k+%28musicfromrizzo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af25f77c9a35aeab1ba05871a3a4f2c8c36be7f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,37,247,124,154,53,174,171,27,160,88,113,163,164,242,200,195,107,231,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
