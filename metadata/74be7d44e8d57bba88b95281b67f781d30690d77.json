The record was unofficial and never documented or confirmed.[2] When documentary filmmaker Cory Welles called it to Roy's attention, he decided he should be the one to break it.[3]\nRoy and co-driver Jonathan Goodrich, his longtime friend, completed a practice run in December 2005, finishing with a time of 34 hours and 46 minutes. A subsequent attempt in April 2006 added a spotter plane, but the failure of his M5's fuel pump ended the run in Oklahoma. On October 7 of 2006 Roy and replacement co-driver David Maher, a New York investment banker (who was also his 2003 Gumball co-driver), embarked on another run. On this, the successful 31:04 run Roy claims 2,794 mapped miles and 2800 road miles - which he covered at an average speed of 90.1 mph.[3] The run took place over Columbus Day weekend so as to meet minimal traffic, in part for safety; they also avoided any type of reckless driving such as tailgating, although they reached top speeds of 160 mph.[4] Roy's route, which hit only four toll booths, three or four red lights, and only one close call with the highway patrol in Oklahoma, ended at the Santa Monica Pier.[4]\nThe record was witnessed in part by Davey Johnson and Mike Spinelli, contributor and managing editor of the automobile blog Jalopnik.[3][1] The time was recorded by a time clock which was punched as they left New York and flown to California before they arrived.[4]\nAnother rally driver team, comprising Gumball veterans Richard Rawlings and Dennis Collins, claim they beat the record in May 2007 at 31:59 on a 2,811 mile route; they also claim that Roy did not &quot;stick to the route&quot; of the original Cannonball Run. Alex Roy, on the other hand, claims that almost every year's route was different, and that the only rule was total time point-to-point.[5] The 31:04 record was set with sufficient margin to break the record even with the same route as the longest ever cross-country race.[5] The originator of the Cannonball Run, Brock Yates, does not acknowledge any records or sanction races due to his concern that &quot;somebody was going to get killed&quot;.[3] Roy expresses similar concern with regard to anyone attempting to break his claimed record.[4]\nIn October 2007, Roy published a book on his racing career, The Driver: My Dangerous Pursuit of Speed and Truth in the Outlaw Racing World (Harper Collins, ISBN 978-0-06-122793-6). Information on the record-setting run was withheld until publication.[3]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74be7d44e8d57bba88b95281b67f781d30690d77","amp;dn":"32+Hours+7+Minutes+%282013%29+%5BAlex+Roy%2C+cross+country+speed+record+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74be7d44e8d57bba88b95281b67f781d30690d77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,190,125,68,232,213,123,186,136,185,82,129,182,127,120,29,48,105,13,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
