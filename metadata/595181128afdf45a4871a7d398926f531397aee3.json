Before that night she and the two other members of her Triad were the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s star bounty hunters, mercilessly cleansing the city of the murderous creatures living in the shadows, from vampires to shape-shifters to trolls. Then something terrible happened that not only cost all three of them their lives but also convinced the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other Hunters that Evy was a traitorÃ¢â‚¬â€and she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even remember what it was.\nNow sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a fugitive, piecing together her memory, trying to deal some serious justiceÃ¢â‚¬â€and discovering that she has only three days to solve her own murder before the reincarnation spell wears off. Because in three days Evy will die againÃ¢â‚¬â€but this time thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no second chance. . . .\n\nAs Lie the Dead\nEvangeline Stone, a rogue bounty hunter, never asked for a world divided between darkness and light . . .\n\n. . . or the power to die and live again in someone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s borrowed body. After a murder plot meant to take her out leaves an entire race of shapeshifters nearly extinct, Evy is gnawed by guilt. So when one of the few survivors of the slaughter enlists her aid, she feels duty-bound to helpÃ¢â‚¬â€even though protecting a frail, pregnant shifter is the last thing Evy needs, especially with the world going to hell around her.\n\nAmid weres, Halfies, gremlins, vampsÃ¢â‚¬â€and increasingly outgunned humansÃ¢â‚¬â€a war for supremacy is brewing. With shifters demanding justice, her superiors desperate to control her, and an assassin on her trail, Evy discovers a horrifying conspiracy. And she may be the only person in the world who can stop itÃ¢â‚¬â€unless, of course, her own side gets her first.\n\nAnother Kind of Dead: \nShe can heal her own wounds. She can nail a monster to a wall. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one danger Evangeline Stone never saw coming.\n\nBeen there. Done that. Evy Stone is a former Dreg Bounty Hunter who died and came back to life with some extraordinary powers. Now all but five people in the world think she is dead again, this time for goodÃ¢â‚¬â€immolated in a factory fire set specifically for her. Evy and Wyatt, her partner/lover/friend, can no longer trust their former allies, or even the highest echelons of the TriadsÃ¢â‚¬â€the army of fighters holding back from an unsuspecting public a tide of quarreling, otherworldly creaturesÃ¢â‚¬â€they can trust only each other. Because when the Triads raided a macabre, monster-filled lab of science experiments and hauled away the remnants, they failed to capture their creator: a brilliant, vampire-obsessed scientist with a wealth of powerful, anti-Dreg weaponry to trade for what he desires most of allÃ¢â‚¬â€Evy Stone: alive and well, and the key to his ultimate experiment in mad science.\n\nWrong Side Of Dead\nMonster hunter Evangeline Stone woke up on the wrong side of dead this morning - and now there's hell to pay.\n\nBarely recovered from her extended torture at the hands of mad scientist Walter Thackery, Evy can use a break. What she gets instead is a war, as the battered Triads that keep Dreg City safe find themselves under attack by half-Blood vampires who have somehow retained their reason, making them twice as lethal. Worse, the Halfies are joined by a breed of were-creature long believed extinct - back and more dangerous than ever. Meanwhile, Evy's attempts at reconciliation with the man she loves take a hit after Wyatt is viciously assaulted - an attack traced to Thackery, who has not given up his quest to exterminate all vampires . . . even if he has to destroy Dreg City to do it. With Wyatt's time running out, another threat emerges from the shadows and a staggering betrayal shatters the fragile alliance between the Triads, vampires, and shapeshifters, turning Evy's world upside down forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:595181128afdf45a4871a7d398926f531397aee3","amp;dn":"Kelly+Meding-dreg+city+series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"595181128afdf45a4871a7d398926f531397aee3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,81,129,18,138,253,244,90,72,113,167,211,152,146,111,83,19,151,174,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
