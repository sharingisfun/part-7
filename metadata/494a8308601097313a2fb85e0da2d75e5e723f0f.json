In this book we will go through a journey of getting to know the technology by creating and planning data-driven visualizations. This cookbook is organized in a linear, progressive way so it can be read from start to finish, as well as be used as a resource for specific tasks.\n\nThis book travels through the steps involved in creating a fully interactive and animated visualization in HTML5 and JavaScript. You will start from very simple Ã¢â‚¬Å“hello worldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ samples and quickly dive deeper into the world of graphs and charts in HTML5. Followed by learning how canvas works and carrying out a group of tasks geared at taking what we learned and implementing it in a variety of chart types. With each chapter the content becomes more complex and our creations become more engaging and interactive.\n\nOur goal is that by the end of this book you will have a strong foundation; knowing when to create a chart on your own from scratch and when it would be a good idea to depend on other APIs.\n\nWe finish our book in our last two chapters exploring Google maps and integrating everything we learnt into a full project.
