In short, he traverses all of Asia top to bottom, and end to end. In the three decades since he first travelled this route, Asia has undergone phenomenal change. The Soviet Union has collapsed, China has risen, India booms, Burma slowly smothers, and Vietnam prospers despite the havoc unleashed upon it the last time Theroux passed through. He witnesses all this and more in a 25,000 mile journey, travelling as the locals do, by train, car, bus, and foot.\n\nHis odyssey takes him from Eastern Europe, still hungover from Communism, through tense but thriving Turkey, into the Caucasus, where Georgia limps back toward feudalism while its neighbour Azerbaijan revels in oil-driven capitalism. As he penetrates deeper into AsiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart, his encounters take on an otherworldly cast. The two chapters that follow show us Turkmenistan, a profoundly isolated society at the mercy of an almost comically egotistical dictator, and Uzbekistan, a ruthless authoritarian state. From there, he retraces his steps through India, Mayanmar, China, and Japan, providing his penetrating observations on the changes these countries have undergone.\n\nBrilliant, caustic, and totally addictive, Ghost Train to the Eastern Star is Theroux at his very best.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97d0255b3586263c06fc4cc563622c15ea2c2a22","amp;dn":"Ghost+Train+to+the+Eastern+Star+-+Paul+Theroux.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97d0255b3586263c06fc4cc563622c15ea2c2a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,208,37,91,53,134,38,60,6,252,76,197,99,98,44,21,234,44,42,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
