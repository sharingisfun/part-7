Not only did he score a series of multi-millionselling albums\n        containing chart-topping hit singles and perform soldout tours of the\n        U.S. and around the world, but he also took charge of his music\n        creatively, writing or co-writing most of his songs and arranging and\n        producing his records. He was equally well known for his distinctive\n        interpretations of classic pop and R&amp;B songs, reflecting his knowledge\n        and appreciation of the popular music of his youth. Possessed of a\n        smooth, versatile tenor voice, he charmed millions with his romantic\n        music.\n\n        Hidden Gems is a compilation of album tracks, soundtrack offerings and\n        rare live performances that are resonate with Luther Vandross' fans.\n        Hidden Gems is the first time that these songs appear in one place and\n        will allow the casual listener to discover songs they never heard and\n        the devoted fan the opportunity to re-live what they love about Luther\n        Vandross.\n\n        R.I.P.
