A Werewolf Problem in Central Russia, the second of Pelevin's Russian Booker Prize-winning short story collections, continues his Sputnik-like rise. The writers to whom he is frequently comparedÃ¢â‚¬â€Kafka, Bulgakov, Philip K. Dick, and Joseph HellerÃ¢â‚¬â€are all deft fabulists, who find fuel for their fires in society's deadening protocol. \n\n&quot;At the very start of the third semester, in one of the lectures on Marxism-Leninism, Nikita Dozakin made a remarkable discovery,&quot; begins the story &quot;Sleep.&quot; Nikita's discovery is that everyone around him, from parents to television talk-show hosts, is actually asleep. In &quot;Vera Pavlova's Ninth Dream,&quot; the attendant in a public toilet finds that her researches into solipsism have dire and diabolical consequences. In the title story, a young Muscovite, Sasha, stumbles upon a group of people in the forest who can transform themselves into wolves. As Publishers Weekly noted, &quot;Pelevin's allegories are reminiscent of children's fairy tales in their fantastic depictions of worlds within worlds, solitary souls tossed helplessly among them.&quot; PelevinÃ¢â‚¬â€whom Spin called &quot;a master absurdist, a brilliant satirist of things Soviet, but also of things human&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€carries us in A Werewolf Problem in Central Russia to a land of great sublimity and black comic brilliance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54d89950d03215312f9cf1bbc90f510fa3ef8e28","amp;dn":"Werewolf+Problem+in+Central+Russia+by+Victor+Pelevin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54d89950d03215312f9cf1bbc90f510fa3ef8e28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,216,153,80,208,50,21,49,47,156,241,187,201,15,81,15,163,239,142,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
