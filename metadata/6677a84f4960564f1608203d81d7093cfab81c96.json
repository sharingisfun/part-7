In the words of\nlead singer and songwriter Dave King, &quot;It\nwasn't the album we set out to write. It\nbecame the album we had to write.&quot;\n\n&quot;Speed Of Darkness&quot; was written in Detroit, MI\nand takes a hard-nosed look at the economic\ncollapse in the US: the causes and the direct\neffect it has had on everyday people. The\nMotor City serves as the album's muse and one\nof the biggest examples of what has gone\nwrong. While &quot;Speed Of Darkness&quot; attacks much\nof the greed and ignorance responsible for\nwhere we are, the album also delivers a\nmessage of hope, humanity and the resilience\nof mankind. It reminds us how we grow stronger\nwhen faced with adversity and how we bond\ntogether and become more involved.\n\n&quot;Speed Of Darkness&quot; features Flogging Molly's\nown blend of rock, folk, punk, blues and\ntraditional Irish music with King's populist\npoetry. The title track explodes with an\nintense rush of pure adrenaline and passion.\nThe same can be said of &quot;The Power's Out&quot;,\nOliver Boy&quot; and &quot;Don't Shut 'Em Down&quot;, while,\n&quot;So Sail On&quot; and &quot;The Cradle Of Humankind&quot; cut\nstraight to the heart with their gorgeous\nmelodies and poignant messages. The band's\ntraditional roots shine on &quot;The Heart Of The\nSea&quot;, &quot;The Present State Of Grace&quot; and &quot;A\nPrayer For Me In Silence&quot;, a duet with\nfiddler Bridget Regan, a Detroit native and\nthe wife of King. &quot;Speed Of Darkness&quot; was\nproduced by Ryan Hewitt (Red Hot Chili\nPeppers, The Avett Brothers).\n\nFrom their beginnings as a raucous pub band in\nLos Angeles in the late 1990's, King, Regan,\nguitarist Dennis Casey, bassist Nathen\nMaxwell, accordion player Matthew Hensley,\nbanjo/mandolin player Robert Schmidt and\ndrummer George Schwindt wore their blue collar\nethos proudly and loudly, especially during\ntheir incredible live performances. And now,\nas the country and the rest of the world rise\nup to recover and rebuild, never has that\nethos been more apparent and important than on\n&quot;Speed Of Darkness&quot;.\n\nooh ye..\n\nt r a c k  l i s t  :\n\n01.
