McPherson - acclaimed as AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest living Civil War historian - has garnered critical praise for his compelling narrative style. Tried by War brilliantly explores how Abraham Lincoln - struggling with feckless generals, fickle masses, and his own fearful demons - expanded the role of Commander in Chief amidst a war that defined him.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c305fcd2d38f1eea1caf772ca2e71564cc7bfcd0","amp;dn":"TRIED+BY+WAR+-+James+McPherson.+Read+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c305fcd2d38f1eea1caf772ca2e71564cc7bfcd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,5,252,210,211,143,30,234,28,175,119,44,162,231,21,100,204,123,252,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
