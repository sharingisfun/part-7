Knight.\n\nTEXTBOOK INFO:\n2nd ed (c2008): &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/9780321513335.page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/9780321513335.page&lt;/a&gt;\n3rd ed (c2013): &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/9780321740908.page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/9780321740908.page&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWho can use these solutions?\n1) Those working with the 2nd edition of the text. They need to download the solutions file only.\n2) Those working with the 3rd edition (current) of the text, knowing that ~80 % of the problems in the 3rd come from the 2nd. These &quot;recycled&quot; problems are often moved around (read renumbered) or slightly modified (data, requested parameter, etc.) so as to appear as new in a given chapter. To facilitate the problem number interchange between the 2nd and 3rd editions, a file containing only the statements of the problems found in the 2nd edition is included.\n\nIf you would like to have a full copy of the text in its 2nd edition, there's one here at 335 MB. You can get one which is not too bad at 1/5 that weight by googling the following string of 40 hexadecimal characters (hash code in torrent parlance, aka torrent DNA), and look for results by TorrentHound (&quot;Download .torrent&quot;) or TorrentBit (&quot;Download Torrent&quot;): 9146BDE2B0DAB45442F91093D09351B94D8429FD\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81507a9a100d38407cd123c1e2758a5c95c51c4f","amp;dn":"Physics+for+Scientists+and+Engineers+2nd+%283rd%29+Knight+solutions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81507a9a100d38407cd123c1e2758a5c95c51c4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,80,122,154,16,13,56,64,124,209,35,193,226,117,138,92,149,197,28,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
