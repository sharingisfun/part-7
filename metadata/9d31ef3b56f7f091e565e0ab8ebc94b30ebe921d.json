There's a real sense of involvement from Bird on these sides, which collect up all the master takes and also include some live tracks from Carnegie Hall that -- judging from the sometimes uneasy murmurings of the crowd -- amply illustrate just how weirdly this mixture of bop lines against &quot;legit&quot; arrangements was perceived. The music on this collection is lush, poetic, romantic as hell, and the perfect antidote to a surfeit of jazz records featuring undisciplined blowing. There's a lot of jazz, but there's only one Bird. By \nCub Koda.\n**\nCharlie Parker welcomed the opportunity to record standards with a small string ensemble in 1949, and the results are stunning, his liquid alto soaring over the tuneful and only occasionally stiff arrangements. Along the way, he invests tunes like &quot;I Didn't Know What Time It Was&quot; and &quot;Laura&quot; with a unique blend of bluesy realism and mercurial improvisation. The CD adds live versions from a Carnegie Hall concert, and there are also two brilliant versions of Neal Hefti's &quot;Repetition.&quot; The 1947 version has Bird flying spontaneously over the dense orchestration of horns, strings, and Latin percussion. \nBy Stuart Broomer. \n\nIn the 1940s, Norman Granz was a jazz visionary in several ways; one of these was his incorporation of strings into a variety of recordings. Granz ultimately attracted some of the best jazz artists of the era (and of all time). He managed a yet-to-be-duplicated balance of commercialism and risk-taking, of business and art, that led to the recording of some of jazz's landmark recordings. Charlie Parker With Strings (now on Verve, originally on Clef) is generally acknowledged as the first release to feature a jazz soloist backed by violins. It was just the beginning. Arguably the greatest improviser of all time, Charlie Parker was reputed to have been interested in doing a strings album for years. Granz gave him the opportunity to do it, with strings arranged and conducted by Jimmy Carroll (who was working for Granz at the time). Bird's album was monumental in more than the fact that he added strings - it was also an album of all standards, with Parker clearly stating each melody. &quot;Just Friends&quot; became Parker's biggest-selling single and the record of which he was said to have been most proud. \n\n**\n Manny Albam- Sax (Baritone)  \n Tony Aless- Piano  \n Joe Benaventi- Cello  \n Ted Blume- Vocals  \n Will Bradley- Trombone  \n Frank Brieff- Viola  \n Eddie Brown- Oboe  \n Maurice Brown- Cello  \n Ray Brown- Bass  \n Sam Caplan- Vocals  \n Jimmy Carroll- Arranger, Conductor   \n Art Drelinger- Woodwind  \n Manny Fidler- Vocals  \n Stan Freeman- Piano  \n Bronislaw Gimpel- Vocals  \n Chris Griffin- Trumpet  \n Bob Haggart- Bass  \n Al Haig Piano  \n Bill Harris- Trombone  \n Sid Harris- Vocals  \n Roy Haynes- Drums  \n Max Hollander- Vocals  \n Diego Iborra- Percussion  \n Vinnie Jacobs- French Horn   \n Stan Karpenia- Vocals  \n Harry Katzman- Vocals  \n Howard Kay- Vocals  \n Don Lamond- Drums  \n John LaPorta- Clarinet  \n Bernie Leighton- Piano  \n Milton Lomask- Vocals  \n Tommy Mace- Oboe  \n Shelly Manne- Drums    \n Wallace McManus- Harp  \n Harry Melnikoff- Vocals  \n Doug Mettome- Trumpet  \n Frank Miller- Cello  \n Mitch Miller- Oboe  \n Verlye Mills- Harp  \n Pete Mondello- Sax (Tenor)  \n Toots Mondello- Sax (Alto)   \n Nat Nathanson- Viola  \n Gene Orloff- Vocals  \n Charlie Parker- Sax (Alto)  \n Flip Phillips- Sax (Tenor)  \n Al Porcino- Trumpet  \n Tommy Potter- Bass  \n Bernie Privin- Trumpet   \n Samuel Rand- Vocals  \n Buddy Rich- Drums  \n Myor Rosen- Harp  \n Hank Ross- Sax (Tenor)  \n Curly Russell- Bass  \n Fred Ruzilla- Viola  \n Art Ryerson- Guitar  \n Sonny Salad- Sax (Alto)   \n Sylvan Shulman- Vocals  \n Joseph Singer- French Horn  \n Zelly Smirnoff- Vocals  \n Lou Stein- Piano  \n Dave Uchitel- Viola  \n Bart Varsalona- Trombone (Bass)  \n Stanley Webb- Sax (Baritone)  \n Ray Wetzel- Trumpet  \n Murray Williams- Sax (Alto)  \n Jack Zayde- Vocals  \n Isadore Zir- Viola  \n**\n\n01.
