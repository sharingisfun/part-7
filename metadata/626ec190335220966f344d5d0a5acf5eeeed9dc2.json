MegÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Controller keeps her enslaved so he can have full access to her visions. But when she escapes, the only safe place Meg can hide is at the Lakeside CourtyardÃ¢â‚¬â€a business district operated by the Others. \n\nShape-shifter Simon Wolfgard is reluctant to hire the stranger who inquires about the Human Liaison job. First, he senses sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s keeping a secret, and second, she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t smell like human prey. Yet a stronger instinct propels him to give Meg the job. And when he learns the truth about Meg and that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wanted by the government, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to decide if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth the fight between humans and the Others that will surely follow.\n\n==============================================================\nMurder of Crows (The Others #2)\n==============================================================\nAfter winning the trust of the terra indigene residing in the Lakeside Courtyard, Meg Corbyn has had trouble figuring out what it means to live among them. As a human, Meg should be barely tolerated prey, but her abilities as a cassandra sangue make her something more.\n\nThe appearance of two addictive drugs has sparked violence between the humans and the Others, resulting in the murders of both species in nearby cities. So when Meg has a dream about blood and black feathers in the snow, Simon WolfgardÃ¢â‚¬â€Lakeside's shape-shifting leaderÃ¢â‚¬â€wonders whether their blood prophet dreamed of a past attack or of a future threat.\n\nAs the urge to speak prophecies strikes Meg more frequently, trouble finds its way inside the Courtyard. Now the Others and the handful of humans residing there must work together to stop the man bent on reclaiming their blood prophetÃ¢â‚¬â€and stop the danger that threatens to destroy them all.\n\n==============================================================\nVision in Silver (The Others #3)\n==============================================================\nThe Others freed the cassandra sangue to protect the blood prophets from exploitation, not realizing their actions would have dire consequences. Now the fragile seers are in greater danger than ever beforeÃ¢â‚¬â€both from their own weaknesses and from those who seek to control their divinations for wicked purposes. In desperate need of answers, Simon Wolfgard, a shape-shifter leader among the Others, has no choice but to enlist blood prophet Meg CorbynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help, regardless of the risks she faces by aiding him.\n\nMeg is still deep in the throes of her addiction to the euphoria she feels when she cuts and speaks prophecy. She knows each slice of her blade tempts death. But Others and humans alike need answers, and her visions may be SimonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only hope of ending the conflict.\n\nFor the shadows of war are deepening across the Atlantik, and the prejudice of a fanatic faction is threatening to bring the battle right to Meg and SimonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doorstepÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:626ec190335220966f344d5d0a5acf5eeeed9dc2","amp;dn":"The+Others+Series+by+Anne+Bishop+%2869books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"626ec190335220966f344d5d0a5acf5eeeed9dc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,110,193,144,51,82,32,150,111,52,77,93,10,90,207,94,238,237,157,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
