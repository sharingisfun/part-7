Stay tuned for it folks!\n\nThis is a CD of The Canadian Tenors (2008) who are capable of similar\nquality to what the Ten Tenors achieve in their best song included\nhere as a bonus track in what we now have of it. (itunes doesnt list\nthis song either for some strange reason - at the moment in any event).\nEven if they mainly put out 256k cores it is close enough to the max\nof the real McCoy if they have it to offer and so why not! (Some material\nis nowhere to be found in this country - we even had to get the popular Sean O'Neill band's CD sent to us from Ireland as Canada at present doesn't\nhonour availability of such music tastes equally to say rap music I am\nentirely honest in suggesting as the latter is plentifully in store while\nthe former is frowned upon as somewhat posturing to be somewhat sensibly\nsuperior prhaps. Such ideas are a &quot;no no&quot; indeed it would seem! What a shame!\n\nAs for the Canadian Tenors CD we otherwise bring you today, I can only\nsay that for a country that does so little for Western music and culture\nin its own efforts - (I daresay this country could even often manage a Bryn\nTerfel from amongst its own ranks if it chose to) - and what not indeed eh -\nits a nice enough effort - for the most part. specifically the Latin and\nFrench sections are well done while the English content I have to say is in\na tone lacking emotive sincerety however it is still an improvement over \n&quot;Eminem music&quot; I daresay!\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\n\n\nThe Canadian Tenors (2008) CD 320k (musicfomrizzo) plus bonus track\n\nThe Canadian Tenors - Adagio.mp3\nThe Canadian Tenors - Always There.mp3\nThe Canadian Tenors - Because We Believe.mp3\nThe Canadian Tenors - Belle.mp3\nThe Canadian Tenors - Home I'll Be.mp3\nThe Canadian Tenors - I Only Know How to Love.mp3\nThe Canadian Tenors - La Califfa.mp3\nThe Canadian Tenors - Luna.mp3\nThe Canadian Tenors - One More Day.mp3\nThe Canadian Tenors - Remember Me.mp3\nThe Canadian Tenors - Sempre Vicino.mp3\nThe Canadian Tenors - Watching Over Me.mp3\n \nbonus track\nThe Ten Tenors Con La Orquesta De Rtve - En Aranjuez Con Tu Amor.mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b35040c3409fe752e070c124234cce8d0f6ec79b","amp;dn":"The+Canadian+Tenors+%282008%29+CD+320k+plus+bonus+michaelrizzo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b35040c3409fe752e070c124234cce8d0f6ec79b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,80,64,195,64,159,231,82,224,112,193,36,35,76,206,141,15,110,199,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
