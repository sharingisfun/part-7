Some of us were disappointed when it was announced for PSP, coupled with a vaguely pessimistic outlook because the title, which dropped the Parasite Eve name entirely, suggested it wasn't a full sequel. Despite this, Aya Brea reprises her role as protagonist, and the action-RPG gameplay is mostly intact. It's definitely a different take on the series though, both in gameplay, story and outstanding visuals. \n\nInstallation: just copy to your ISO folder located on your psp memory stick.\n\nTested on CFW: 5.00 M33-6, 5.x GEN, Prometheus-4 and 6.3x PRO\n\nEnjoy and comment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34de63c28a8ee5f347dace4d53dd2801bc5125b8","amp;dn":"PSP+Parasite+Eve+3rd+Birthday","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34de63c28a8ee5f347dace4d53dd2801bc5125b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,222,99,194,138,142,229,243,71,218,206,77,83,221,40,1,188,81,37,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
