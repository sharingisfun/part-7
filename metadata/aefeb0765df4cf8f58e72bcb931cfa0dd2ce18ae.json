I made this Image with Nero, but you can use any program to burn it, as long as it burns image files. I use Dvd Decrypter which is free and is found here http://dvd-decrypter.en.softonic.com/   I suggest you burn this to DVD, as I did not test this with a CD-R. It was made for DVD so Burn It to a DVD. You can play it on PS2 assuming you have a ps2 that has a MOD-CHIP or you are using a SWAP DISC and some kind of boot method. It includes 948 games, I tested and it works great, although there will be the odd rom that will give you problems, it is a compatibility issue.\nZombies ate my neighbours for example loads fine but will not respond to the button control.\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aefeb0765df4cf8f58e72bcb931cfa0dd2ce18ae","amp;dn":"Sega+Genesis%28PGEN%29+for+PS2+%2B+948+games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aefeb0765df4cf8f58e72bcb931cfa0dd2ce18ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,254,176,118,93,244,207,143,88,231,43,203,147,28,250,13,210,206,24,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
