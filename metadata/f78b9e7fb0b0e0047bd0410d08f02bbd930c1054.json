Rogers had a deep, rich singing voice and an amazing melodic talent; his original songs are of legendary quality. But this album consists of songs by other writers and a few traditional numbers from his native Canada, many of them remembered from his childhood. Accompanied by his brother Garnet on fiddle and bassist Jim Morison, Rogers performs several tunes by his uncle Lee Bushell, including the amusing &quot;Strings and Dory Plug,&quot; a Calgary cowboy song &quot;Two-Bit Cayuse,&quot; and, most affectingly of all, the aching &quot;Cape St. Mary's&quot; and the 19th century Scots song &quot;Scarborough Settler's Lament.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f78b9e7fb0b0e0047bd0410d08f02bbd930c1054","amp;dn":"Stan+Rogers+-+For+The+Family+%5B1983%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f78b9e7fb0b0e0047bd0410d08f02bbd930c1054","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,139,158,127,176,176,224,4,123,208,65,13,8,240,43,189,147,12,16,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
