E. Gracia, &quot;Painting Borges: Philosophy Interpreting Art Interpreting Literature&quot;\nISBN: 1438441770, 1438441789 | 2012 | PDF | 322 pages | 33 MB\n\nA provocative examination of the artistic interpretation of twelve of BorgesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most famous stories.\n\nIn this groundbreaking book, Jorge J. E. Gracia explores the artistic interpretation of fiction from a philosophical perspective. Focusing on the work of Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most celebrated literary figures of Latin America, Gracia offers original interpretations of twelve of BorgesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most famous stories about identity and memory, freedom and destiny, and faith and divinity. He also examines twenty-four artistic interpretations of these storiesÃ¢â‚¬â€two for eachÃ¢â‚¬â€by contemporary Argentinean and Cuban artists such as Carlos Estevez, Leon Ferrari, Mirta Kupferminc, Nicolas Menza, and Estela Pereda. This philosophical exploration of how artists have interpreted literature contributes to both aesthetics and hermeneutics, makes new inroads into the understanding of BorgesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work, and introduces readers to two of the most vibrant artistic currents today. Color images of the artworks discussed are included.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“From Michel Foucault to Arthur Danto, the use of Borges to analyze art isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t new, but Painting Borges goes a step further: it looks at Borges as an inspiration to painters while also interpreting hermeneutically the way he himself looked at things through his blind eyes. I found Jorge J. E. GraciaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s volume provocative, engaging, and exhaustive in its approach.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Ilan Stavans, Lewis-Sebring Professor in Latin American and Latino Culture, Amherst College","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e00eb1585128fd959cd7537fb7de733e19d6da78","amp;dn":"Painting+Borges+-+Philosophy+Interpreting+Art+Interpreting+Liter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e00eb1585128fd959cd7537fb7de733e19d6da78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,14,177,88,81,40,253,149,156,215,83,127,183,222,115,62,25,214,218,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
