Okay, so they don't have a lot of competition...but their hybrid sound of Punk, Ska, Hip-hop and (most importantly) eastern European &quot;Roma&quot; (i.e. Gypsy) music is so good, you'd honestly be a fool not to at least sample it.\n\nThis is by far their best album - superbly recorded in glorious analogue by Steve Albini - and one that actually captures much of the celebratory power of their extraordinary live shows. I won't writemoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ any more as, frankly, I don't have the extensive vocabulary necessary to wax lyrical about this truly wonderful band. However, in a just world, they'd be superstars - recognised as ground-breaking, unique, Punk auteurs. As it happens, they'll probably not be fully appreciated until they're long gone, a la The Clash.\n\nMake sure you're one of the few who catches them NOW.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da8c6f441a21a932bead26ef4bd29c6b1f9f5c06","amp;dn":"Gogol+Bordello+-+Gypsy+Punks+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da8c6f441a21a932bead26ef4bd29c6b1f9f5c06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,140,111,68,26,33,169,50,190,173,38,239,75,210,156,107,31,159,92,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
