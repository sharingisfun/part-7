The album was produced by Cooder who travelled to Cuba to record sessions with the musicians, many of whom were previously largely unknown outside Cuba. The musicians and the songs were later also featured in a documentary film of the same name.\n\nThe music featured on the album was inspired by the Buena Vista Social Club, a membership club that was at its height during the 1940s. Many of the musicians performing on the record were either former performers at the club or were prominent Cuban musicians during the era of the club's existence. Other younger musicians on the record trace their musical roots back to pre-revolutionary Cuban music.\n\nBuena Vista Social Club started a craze in the Western World for Latin American music, particularly Cuban music.\n\nIn 2003 the album was listed by Rolling Stone magazine as #260 in The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buena_Vista_Social_Club_(album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buena_Vista_Social_Club_(album)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracks\n1- Chan Chan\n2- De Camino a La Vereda\n3- El Cuarto de Tula\n4- Pueblo Nuevo\n5- Dos Gardenias\n6- Y Tu Que Has Hecho\n7- Veinte Anos\n8- El Carretero\n9- Candela\n10- Amor de Loca Juventud\n11- Orgullecida\n12- Murmullo\n13- Buena Vista Social Club\n14- La Bayamesa\n\nArtwork (300dpi scan) included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2de18609c7dcae57f2928c052151d069527a97bc","amp;dn":"Buena+Vista+Social+Club+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2de18609c7dcae57f2928c052151d069527a97bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,225,134,9,199,220,174,87,242,146,140,5,33,81,208,105,82,122,151,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
