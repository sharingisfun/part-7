From Academy Award-winning writer/director Oliver Stone, this ten-part documentary series looks back at human events that at the time went under reported, but that crucially shaped America's unique and complex history over the 20th century. From the atomic bombing of Japan to the Cold War and the fall of Communism, this in-depth, surprising, and totally riveting series demands to be watched again and again.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  World War II \r\nThe first chapter explores the birth of the American Empire by focusing on Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. Through examination of key decisions during World War II, discover unsung heroes such as American Henry Wallace and explore the demonization of the Soviets.\r\n\r\n2)  Roosevelt, Truman, &amp; Wallace \r\nHighlights from the historical upset of Harry Truman replacing Henry Wallace as Roosevelt's Vice President during his fourth term - this dramatic shift in leadership propelled the US towards empire building. Exploration of the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union and the beginnings of the Cold War. The relationships between Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill are an integral part of post-war Europe's division at the Yalta conference..\r\n\r\n3)  The Bomb \r\nThe strategies behind the U.S. atomic bombings of Japan are explored as well as the new mythology that emerged from the war. The bombing haunted the Soviets and mistrust towards the Allies grew quickly. The consequences of beginning a process that could end life on the planet are examined.\r\n\r\n4)  The Cold War: 1945-1950 \r\nThe equation changes: specific month-by-month causes of the Cold War emerge and it is not entirely clear who started it. Highlights include Churchill's Iron Curtain speech, the civil war in Greece and the Red Scare that prompts the rise of Joseph McCarthy, the House Un-American Activities Committee and the FBI\r\n\r\n5)  The '50s: Eisenhower, the Bomb &amp; the Third World \r\nEisenhower and John Foster Dulles replace Truman. Stalin dies but relations with the Soviet Union turn colder. The H-bomb and the doctrine of nuclear annihilation are explored, as are the Korean War and U.S. rearmament. McCarthyism grows and so does the ruthlessness of U.S. policy towards a Third World. Eisenhower emerges as a game changer.\r\n\r\n6)  JFK: To the Brink \r\nJFK and the Bay of Pigs; on the brink of total war during Cuban Missile Crisis; early Vietnam; JFK's attempts at peace with Khrushchev; JFK assassinated.\r\n\r\n7)  Johnson, Nixon &amp; Vietnam: Reversal of Fortune \r\nCataclysm in Vietnam as the war reaches a turning point - there's no going back. The betrayal by Richard Nixon.\r\n\r\n8)  Reagan Gorbachev &amp; Third World-Rise of the Right \r\nCarter's dreams of change give way to Ronald Reagan. Gorbachev redeems Reagan and fresh opportunities for peace arise. The debate over Reagan's legacy.\r\n\r\n9)  Bush &amp; Clinton: Squandered Peace-New World Order \r\nGeorge W. Bush's doctrine of endless war in Iraq and Afghanistan and the continued cannibalization of the U.S. economy. Squandered chances given by the end of the Cold War. A new USA, the National Security Fortress.\r\n\r\n10)  Bush &amp; Obama - Age of Terror \r\nThe meaning of events up to today. Obama and the destiny of the American Empire.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------     \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen0.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e3/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen1.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/75/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen2.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/78/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen3.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen4.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bb/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen5.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d9/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen6.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen7.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/54/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen8.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen9.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/be/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen10.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/91/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen11.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d7/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen12.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen13.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen14.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ec/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen15.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/53/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen16.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d8/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen17.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/db/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen18.jpg      \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/27/Oliver-Stone-s-Untold-History-of-the-United-States-Screen19.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CAVLC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3184 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 58mins\r\n * Framerate: 23.976 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 10\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.sho.com/sho/oliver-stones-untold-history-of-the-united-states/about","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e0f3cc9baf7bc59fc9de4ad0e60ff7e88977478","amp;dn":"Oliver.Stones.Untold.History.Of.The.United.States.Series.1.10of1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e0f3cc9baf7bc59fc9de4ad0e60ff7e88977478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,15,60,201,186,247,188,89,252,157,228,173,14,96,255,126,136,151,116,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
