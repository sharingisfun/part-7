The Manifesto also predicted the ultimate downfall of the capitalist system. (Summary written by Gesine) by Karl Marx (1818-1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) Translated by Samuel Moore. Tags: Communism socialism revolution work worker labour wages money capitalism socialist communist\n\n\nA spectre is haunting Europe--the spectre of Communism.\nAll the Powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to\nexorcise this spectre: Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot,\nFrench Radicals and German police-spies.\n\nWhere is the party in opposition that has not been decried as\nCommunistic by its opponents in power?  Where is the Opposition\nthat has not hurled back the branding reproach of Communism,\nagainst the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against\nits reactionary adversaries?\n\nTwo things result from this fact.\n\nI.  Communism is already acknowledged by all European Powers\nto be itself a Power.\n\nII.  It is high time that Communists should openly, in the\nface of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their\ntendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of\nCommunism with a Manifesto of the party itself.\n\nTo this end, Communists of various nationalities have\nassembled in London, and sketched the following Manifesto, to be\npublished in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and\nDanish languages.\n\n\n\nI.  BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS\n\nThe history of all hitherto existing societies is the history\nof class struggles.\n\nFreeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf,\nguild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed,\nstood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an\nuninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time\nended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at\nlarge, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.\n\nIn the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a\ncomplicated arrangement of society into various orders, a\nmanifold gradation of social rank.  In ancient Rome we have\npatricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages,\nfeudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices,\nserfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate\ngradations.\n\nThe modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins\nof feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms.  It\nhas but established new classes, new conditions of oppression,\nnew forms of struggle in place of the old ones.  Our epoch, the\nepoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive\nfeature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a\nwhole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps,\ninto two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie\nand Proletariat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7428b83a5f9a51885e12166c0895a41f7f05396a","amp;dn":"Audiobook+The+Communist+Manifesto+by+Karl+Marx+and+Friedrich+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7428b83a5f9a51885e12166c0895a41f7f05396a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,40,184,58,95,154,81,136,94,18,22,108,8,149,164,31,127,5,57,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
