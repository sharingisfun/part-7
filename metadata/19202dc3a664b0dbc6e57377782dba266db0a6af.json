Despite the proven effectiveness of the rifleman in battle, the sniper in the 20th century has been regarded as little more than a paid assassin, whose life if captured was forfeit. However, since the Vietnam War the undeniably effective use of such men in combat means that the value of the sniper has gradually become more appreciated by the military, and their prominence on the modern battlefield has increased significantly. In the 21st century they are now regarded as one of the most vital battlefield specialists. \n\nIllustrated throughout with colour and black and white photographs, this is a chronological study of snipers, detailing their evolution, training, weaponry and actions. There are also unique contributions from the men and women whose skill and extraordinary courage have made them the most greatly feared specialist in warfare.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19202dc3a664b0dbc6e57377782dba266db0a6af","amp;dn":"Out+of+Nowhere%3A+A+history+of+the+Military+Sniper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19202dc3a664b0dbc6e57377782dba266db0a6af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,32,45,195,166,100,176,219,198,229,115,119,120,45,186,38,109,176,166,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
