We revisit the\r\nearly 70s with the Faces performing Stay with Me and Three Button Hand Me Down\r\non Sounds for Saturday. The BBC charted Rod's solo success over the years and\r\nthere are classic performances and interviews that will make you dance, sing\r\nand pull on your heartstrings. Songs include Sailing, You're in My Heart, I\r\nDon't Want to Talk about It and Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\r\n\r\nWe also have Rod's performance from Glastonbury 2002 of the classic Handbags and\r\nGladrags, and we dip into the Great American Songbook with his version of the\r\nDorothy Fields classic I'm in the Mood for Love. Finally, rounding off over five\r\ndecades in music is a performance from Rod's Radio 2 concert from May 2013.\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/07305373819709365049.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/47606866426525493161.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/01261822570396494008.png\r\n\r\nFORMAT:.......................: MP4\r\nFULLSIZE:.....................: 659 MiB\r\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*404=16:9\r\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\r\nAUDIO AAC:....................: 256 Kbps [stereo]\r\nCHANNELS:.....................: 2 Front: L/R\r\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\r\nVIDEO BITRATE:................: 1300 Kbps\r\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\r\nRUNTIME:......................: 58mn 56s\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07c1c0a8e2ed09378699aa64a12c7958b8555dee","amp;dn":"BBC+%3D+Rod+Stewart+at+the+BBC+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07c1c0a8e2ed09378699aa64a12c7958b8555dee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,193,192,168,226,237,9,55,134,153,170,100,161,44,121,88,184,85,93,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
