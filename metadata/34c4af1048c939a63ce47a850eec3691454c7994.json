Many of these rips are my own, \nbut some came from various sources because they sounded better than mine because \nmy vinyl or CD had scratches that prevented accurate reproduction. On the vinyl\nrips, I left the clicks and pops in.  I have never been happy with click removal \nsoftware.  \n\nThis is by far the most complete collection available.  It has cuts like &quot;The Electric Co.&quot; with the &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; snippet that was removed in many releases of UABRS.  The Australian Version of &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; Single with an alternate mix of &quot;A Sort Of Homecoming&quot; and &quot;Love Comes Tumbling&quot; with alternate vocals.The fan club releases are all here. Where I have the promo releases, I included those as well.Songs that appear on various collections and soundtracks are also included. If you check the singles against what is listed on U2Wanderer.org, you will find that they are all here (except the non-album singles, some of those are missing). Everything is tagged, with the proper artwork.   If you like the music, please buy it.  This is my first torrent ever. I hope you enjoy it.  A FLAC release is on the way. \n\n================================================================================================================\nALBUMS:\n1980 - Boy\n1981 - October\n1983 - War\n1983 - Under A Blood Red Sky (alternate cuts included)\n1984 - The Unforgettable Fire\n1987 - The Joshua Tree\n1991 - Achtung Baby\n1993 - Zooropa\n1995 - Passengers - OST\n1997 - POP\n2000 - All That You Can't Leave Behind\n2000 - The Million Dollar Hotel - OST\n2002 - Best of 1980-1990\n2002 - The B-Sides 1980-1990\n2002 - Best Of 1990-2000\n2002 - The B-Sides 1990-2000\n2004 - How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\n2006 - 18 Singles\n2007 - The Joshua Tree Deluxe Edition (Disc 2)\n2008 - Boy Deluxe Edition (Disc 2)\n2008 - October Deluxe Edition (Disc 2)\n2008 - War Deluxe Edition (Disc 2)\n2009 - The Unforgettable Fire Deluxe Edition (Disc 2)\n2009 - No Line On The Horizon\n\nEP's:\n1985 - Wide Awake In America\n2002 - 7\n2010 - Wide Awake In Europe\n\nFAN CLUB RELEASES:\n1995 - Melon\n2000 - Hasta La Vista Baby!\n2005 - Communication\n2006 - Zoo TV Live\n2007 - Go Home - Live from Slane Castle\n2009 - U2 Medium, Rare &amp; Remastered\n2010 - Artificial Horizon\n\nSingles from all of the albums.
