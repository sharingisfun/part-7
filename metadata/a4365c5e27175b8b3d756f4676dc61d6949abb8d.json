Recruit heroes and head out into the wilds to fight back against evil. Or, you know, to get sweet sweet loot. Either or.\r\n\r\nPlayers are comparing Folk Tale with Warcraft 3, The Settlers, Banished, The Guild 2, Majesty 2 and Black and White 2. Folk Tale is not a pure play role-playing game such as Pillars Of Eternity, and adopts more of a MOBA approach to hero abilities than a CRPG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4365c5e27175b8b3d756f4676dc61d6949abb8d","amp;dn":"Folk+Tale+v0.3.11.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4365c5e27175b8b3d756f4676dc61d6949abb8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,54,92,94,39,23,91,139,61,117,111,70,118,220,97,214,148,154,187,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
