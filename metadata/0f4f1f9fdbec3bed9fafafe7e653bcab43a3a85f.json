Part of the problem is not understanding how our applications are attacked. To protect your applications you need to BE a hacker. You need to understand how your applications are hacked, and therefore, how to protect them. This course goes over the most common hacking techniques using an array of current attacks to show how a web application is exploited. This course covers exploits and protections for both Web Forms and MVC. Covered are such topics as sql injection, parameter tampering, information leakage, cross-site scripting (xss), cross-site request forgery, encryption, hashing, and denial of service all with applicable demos.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f4f1f9fdbec3bed9fafafe7e653bcab43a3a85f","amp;dn":"Pluralsight+-+Hack-proofing+Your+ASP.NET+Web+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f4f1f9fdbec3bed9fafafe7e653bcab43a3a85f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,79,31,159,219,236,59,237,159,175,175,231,230,83,188,171,67,163,168,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
