But metalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kinship with these genres does not end with musical derivation and composition. Metal, blues, and jazz also share similar folklore. Long before parents were blaming Dee Snider and Rob Halford for their little hellionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (see what I did there?) adolescent tyranny, jazz was called Ã¢â‚¬Å“the devilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOne might trace this attribution to the decadence of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Roaring 20Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Alcohol was outlawed, and that meant no sales taxes. On the black market, anyone who could provide alcohol could make a pretty penny from a customer who wanted his choice poison. As it happened, the establishments that provided the booze provided the music. Jazz itself had nothing to do with the alcohol, cocaine, and hedonistic sexuality of this era.\n\n ARTIST: The Devil and the Almighty Blues\n   \n ALBUM / TITLE: The Devil and the Almighty Blues \n RELEASE YEAR / DATE: 2015   \n COUNTRY: Norway  \n STYLE: Hard Rock Blues, Stoner Rock, Blues Rock   \n DURATION:\t00:45:02\n FILE FORMAT: MP3\n QUALITY: 320 kbps\n\n   \n\n\nDescription\n\n01.
