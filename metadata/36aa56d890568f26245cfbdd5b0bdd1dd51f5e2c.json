Their soundtrack was easily accessible, for the game disc is also an audio CD, so I just made a copy of the disc. \n\nAs the soundtrack for GTA 1, London and 2 consists in mixes and the tracklisting may be a bit tricky to find, I included a .txt file with all the tracks. GTA 3 tracks are very easy to find.\n\nExcept for GTA 1, each radio station comes with a folder picture ; sometimes I had to do it on Photoshop, but anyway.\n\nEnjoy! I'll be seeding for some time, but seed anyway!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36aa56d890568f26245cfbdd5b0bdd1dd51f5e2c","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+I%2C+II+%2B+London%2C+III+%28GTA+1%2C+2%2C+3%29+-+OST+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36aa56d890568f26245cfbdd5b0bdd1dd51f5e2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,170,86,216,144,86,143,38,36,92,251,221,91,11,221,29,213,31,94,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
