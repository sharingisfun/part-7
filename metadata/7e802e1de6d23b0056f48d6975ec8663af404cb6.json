This is Stevie Ray Vaughan's best studio album and the first he recorded sober. &amp;quot;Travis Walk&amp;quot; offers a heady rush of flat-picking, &amp;quot;The House is Rockin'&amp;quot; is full-tilt roots-boogie, &amp;quot;Let Me Love You Baby&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Leave My Girl Alone&amp;quot; are sweet blues epiphanies, and the nine-minute instrumental &amp;quot;Riviera Paradise&amp;quot; is a truly soulful mix of blues and jazz. By now, just a year before his untimely death, Vaughan had also tamed his bawling voice into a rich instrument. In short, this 1989 session is Vaughan at his artistic peak. And the four compelling live performances added to this reissue--&amp;quot;The House Is Rockin',&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Let Me Love You Baby,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Texas Flood,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Life Without You,&amp;quot; all from the In Step tour--prove there was no studio trickery involved. It's raw blues-rock perfection. --Ted Drozdowski \n\nSRV!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e802e1de6d23b0056f48d6975ec8663af404cb6","amp;dn":"Stevie+Ray+Vaughan+-+1999+-+In+Step+%281989%29+%5BRemastered%5D+%5BBonus+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e802e1de6d23b0056f48d6975ec8663af404cb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,128,46,29,230,210,59,0,86,244,141,105,117,236,134,99,175,64,76,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
