To see the source code on open source projects Google the names of the mods (listed below) \n\nThis is an easy-to-use, user-friendly way of putting minecraft on your computer.\n\nYou can contact me via e-mail &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;225c49434b514713101162454f434b4e0c414d4f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;~ or you can add me on MSN with the same address. Or add me on Skype (kaiwaugh)\n\nKnown Bugs:\nNone!\nPlease report ANY non-normal minecraft errors or bugs to me!\n##########################################################################\n\nChanged this version:\nVersion 2.2.0\nFor Minecraft 1.8.1\nAdded back most old mods from 1.7.3\nAdded Single Player Commands\nChanged back to 'classic' Optifine because of reported problems with the MT one.\nAdded new loader (Minecraft Smart Loader v3) (old loaders now in start menu just in case)\n\nAs nobody seemed to read the readme i will keep this small.\n\nThis version includes basic unmodded minecraft, a version with mods and a version with Optifine (See Below)\n\nTooManyItems\nZombe's Modpack\nHD Texture pack Fixer (Now included in Optifine)\nModloader is included.\nDynamic Lights\nSP Commands\nZan's Minimap\nWorldeditCUI\n*Optifine\n\n*Only in the optifine version. Optifne is a mod that dramatically increases FPS and stability on most computors. I have never had any problems with this but if you see random holes in the world, install the standard version. Do not install this if you don't have a slow PC.\n\nThe 'Unlicenced Copy' text remover is not included in this version, because I have heard that the text does not appear in this version. If you see the text E-Mail me.\n\nThe controlls for basic minecraft are in the controlls section in 'Options'. Other Controlls (For the modded version only) are below:\n\nF = Fly On/Off\nE = Fly Up\nQ = Fly Down\nLSHIFT = Fly/walk faster (different from 1.8's sprint feature)\nF6 = NoClip while flying (SSP/CSP ONLY)\nBackspace = Path tracker (See where you have walked)\nNumpad + = Advance Sun Time\nNumpad - = Detract Sun Time\nEND = Stop Time (Freeze Sun in place)\nHOME = Normalize and Resume time\nL = Shows where Hostile Mobs can spawn (Yellow = Night only, Red = Anytime)\nO (in the inventory) = Enables/Disables TooManyItems\nIn single player press the chat button and type &quot;help&quot; to see single player commands commands.\n\nTo run the game and play on a server that is 'cracked' just put in a username and no password and that will act as your name in-game. Email me for some servers you can play on.\n\nIf you appreciate my work, click the +1 Button at the top, so others can see that it is a good torrent :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d9a46d270652a38cf82e0c9a08ba364a75c9bcc","amp;dn":"Easy+Minecraft+Installer+For+1.8.1+With+Optional+Mods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d9a46d270652a38cf82e0c9a08ba364a75c9bcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,154,70,210,112,101,42,56,207,130,224,201,160,139,163,100,167,92,155,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
