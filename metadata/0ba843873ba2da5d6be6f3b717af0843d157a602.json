It focuses on the description of new effects like purely thermal cycles or cases of non-trivial damages. The various models are based on different approaches and methods and scaling aspects are taken into account. In addition to purely phenomenological models, the book also presents mechanisms-based approaches. It includes contributions written by leading authors from a host of different countries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ba843873ba2da5d6be6f3b717af0843d157a602","amp;dn":"Inelastic+Behavior+of+Materials+and+Structures+Under+Monotonic+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ba843873ba2da5d6be6f3b717af0843d157a602","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,168,67,135,59,162,218,93,107,230,243,183,23,175,8,67,209,87,166,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
