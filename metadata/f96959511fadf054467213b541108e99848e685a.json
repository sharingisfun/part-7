His plan is to live in peace with his girl Diane, running his Montreal jazz club NYC. Soon Max, his good friend and financial partner in the illegal affairs, comes along with an offer Nick can't refuse: A historical and priceless French sceptre has been discovered while being smuggled into the country. It is now under massive surveillance in the Montreal Customs House, and soon to be returned to France. Nick has to team up with Max' man inside, the young, talented and aggressive thief Jackie Teller to get the precious item, and suffer no more financial problems ever. Only one question remains: Who will trick whom out of their share?\n\nCast:\n\nRobert De Niro...Nick Wells\nEdward Norton...Jack Teller\nMarlon Brando...Max\nAngela Bassett...Diane\nGary Farmer...Burt\n\nScreens\n                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/6665/pdvd000ii.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/6665/pdvd000ii.png&lt;/a&gt;\n                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/20/pdvd002s.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/20/pdvd002s.png&lt;/a&gt;\n                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img101.imageshack.us/img101/1329/pdvd001u.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img101.imageshack.us/img101/1329/pdvd001u.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMovie Trailer\n                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi1895105305/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi1895105305/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease feel free to post any comments.
