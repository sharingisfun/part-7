Go for it! :D\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nChoose the right imaging for your patients.\n\nRely on this compendium of evidence-based criteria to confidently select the most appropriate imaging modality for the diagnostic investigation of the most commonly evaluated musculoskeletal conditions.\n\nThe Musculoskeletal Imaging Handbook simplifies the complex field of musculoskeletal imaging for the primary practitioner responsible for ordering imaging or for the clinician who wants to understand the role of imaging in their patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s care.\n\nInformation on Radiographs, MRIs, CTs, and Diagnostic Ultrasound is condensed into easily understood bullet points, decision pathways, tables, and charts. The most valuable feature of this Handbook is the ability to see the entire spectrum of imaging available, and understand why one imaging modality is most appropriate at a given point in the diagnostic investigation. \n\nThis Handbook includes all the evidenceÃ¢â‚¬â€œbased criteria currently available to guide a primary practitioner in the selection of the most appropriate imaging investigation for a given clinical condition: the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria for Musculoskeletal Conditions, Western AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Diagnostic Imaging Pathways for Musculoskeletal Conditions, and the Ottawa, Pittsburgh, and Canadian Clinical Decision Rules for ankle, knee, and cervical spine trauma.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the perfect companion to Lynn N. McKinnisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Fundamentals of Musculoskeletal Imaging, 4th Edition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7698e5fe17ffe6e359c48328c1df355be52fe87a","amp;dn":"Musculoskeletal+Imaging+Handbook+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7698e5fe17ffe6e359c48328c1df355be52fe87a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,152,229,254,23,255,230,227,89,196,131,40,193,223,53,91,229,47,232,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
