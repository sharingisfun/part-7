The band received a Juno Award for &quot;Most Promising Group of the Year&quot; in 1987.\n\n&quot;Should I See&quot;, an anti-censorship song, became a minor hit in the United States, reaching 69th position on Billboard's Hot 100 singles in 1987. The video for that song was also nominated at the 1987 Juno Awards for &quot;Best Video of the Year&quot;.\n\nOn their first two albums, FrÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½zen GhÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½st and Nice Place to Visit, the band were originally a studio duo. Arnold Lanni sang lead vocals, and played all the guitar and keyboard parts, and is credited as being the sole songwriter, while Wolf Hassel played bass. Their first two albums featured guest musicians, such as Derry Grehan, lead guitarist of Honeymoon Suite. The drums, however, were sequenced on a computer rather than being played by a human drummer. While Lanni may have programmed the drums himself, the actual programmer is uncredited and unknown.[citation needed] On their final album, Shake Your Spirit there were two official additions to the band: John Bouvette, who was on drums and percussion, and Phil X who played the guitar and did some vocals. Phil X was also credited on the album Nice Place to Visit for being a guitarist, but was not considered an official band member until the final album was released.\n\nFor unknown reasons, on FrÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½zen GhÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½st's second album their name changed from FrÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½zen GhÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½st to Frozen Ghost, although on the third album the artist name returned to its original spelling.\n\nFrÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½zen GhÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½st disbanded in 1993, following their final album Shake Your Spirit. Lanni would go on to become a successful producer for acts such as Our Lady Peace, Finger Eleven and Thousand Foot Krutch. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrozen Ghost 1987\n\n\nFrozen Ghost is the debut album of the band Frozen Ghost, released in 1987. Its first single, &quot;Should I See&quot; (a song about censorship) reached #69 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe run-out groove of side two on the LP record contains unintelligible speech. When played backwards, a voice says, &quot;You are ruining your needle!&quot;\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Should I See&quot; - 3:48\n2.\t&quot;Promises&quot; - 3:50\n3.\t&quot;Beware the Masque&quot; - 4:00\n4.\t&quot;Yum Bai Ya&quot; - 3:55\n5.\t&quot;Love Like a Fire&quot; - 4:07\n6.\t&quot;End of the Line&quot; - 3:32\n7.\t&quot;Time is the Answer&quot; - 4:01\n8.\t&quot;Love Without Lies&quot; - 4:11\n9.\t&quot;Soldiers Cry&quot; - 3:36\n10.\t&quot;Truth in Lies&quot; - 4:20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice Place to Visit 1988\n\n\nNice Place to Visit is the second album by Frozen Ghost.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Better to Try&quot; - 4:42\n2.\t&quot;Pauper in Paradise&quot; - 4:45\n3.\t&quot;Selling Salvation&quot; - 4:57\n4.\t&quot;Step By Step&quot;* - 3:50\n5.\t&quot;Mother Nature&quot; - 3:48\n6.\t&quot;Echo a Miracle&quot; - 4:30\n7.\t&quot;Round and Round&quot; - 4:22\n8.\t&quot;Dream Come True&quot; - 4:19\n9.\t&quot;Perfect World&quot; - 4:25\n10.\t&quot;Suspended Humanation&quot; - 5:05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShake Your Spirit 1991\n\n\nShake Your Spirit is the third and final album from Frozen Ghost, released in 1992.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Come Alive (Intro)&quot; - 0:25\n2.\t&quot;Shake Your Spirit&quot; - 4:11\n3.\t&quot;So Strange&quot; - 3:55\n4.\t&quot;Cry (If You Want To)&quot; - 4:09\n5.\t&quot;Shine On Me&quot; - 4:09\n6.\t&quot;Another Time and Place&quot; - 4:40\n7.\t&quot;Something to Say&quot; - 4:50\n8.\t&quot;Revival (Intro)&quot; - 0:30\n9.\t&quot;Stuck In a Groove&quot; - 4:28\n10.\t&quot;Head Over Heels&quot; - 4:33\n11.\t&quot;Swing to the Rhythm&quot; - 4:06\n12.\t&quot;Doing That Thing&quot; - 4:47\n13.\t&quot;The Whistling Custodian&quot; - 0:34\n14.\t&quot;Gotta Get a Day Job&quot; - 1:48\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49974c1df274716b5057e60c0ca7f0bb08bfcd8f","amp;dn":"Frozen+Ghost+-+Discography+%281987+-+1991%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49974c1df274716b5057e60c0ca7f0bb08bfcd8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,151,76,29,242,116,113,107,80,87,230,12,12,167,240,187,8,191,205,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
