In doing so, MCA has made amends for at least four decades of neglect, unearthing ten previously unreleased tracks as part of the deal.\n\nThe set begins with six of Paul's earliest sides backing salacious blues shouter Georgia White on acoustic guitar, and then there are four extremely rare sides of Paul doing his hillbilly Rhubarb Red act, tootling on harmonica, strumming rhythm guitar, and singing in a honeyed voice. Throughout the collection, there are extensive samplings of Paul backing several top singers from the mainstream of '40s pop -- Bing Crosby, the Andrews Sisters, Dick Haymes, Helen Forrest, and the Delta Rhythm Boys -- his clever, caressing guitar obligatos enhancing the vocals and foreshadowing his ballad work with Ford. The trio sides form the heart of the set, but here again, there is a lot of diversity. Jazz sides like &quot;Blue Skies&quot; and &quot;Dream Dust&quot; are showcases for Paul's extraordinary melodic gift and speed, and the newly released outtakes reveal his streak of perfectionism. But there are also several sweetly sedate Hawaiian tunes and a couple of nifty country &amp; western workouts, &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; and &quot;Steel Guitar Rag,&quot; that integrate his jazz licks into the picture. Although the sound is slightly distorted in spots and short on bass -- the &quot;noise reduction&quot; gremlins at MCA are at it again -- this double-disc set is still a treasure chest for Les Paul collectors\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1\n01 - New Dupree Blues\n02 - Daddy Let Me Lay It On You\n03 - I Just Want Your Stingaree\n04 - Black Rider\n05 - I'll Keep Sittin' On It (If I Can't Sell It)\n06 - Trouble In Mind\n07 - Just Because\n08 - Just Because Answer\n09 - Deep Elem Blues #2\n10 - Deep Elem Blues\n11 - Cindy\n12 - Flipino Hombre\n13 - Dream Dust\n14 - Begin The Beguine (1)\n15 - Dark Eyes\n16 - Blues Skies (1)\n17 - Blues Skies (2)\n18 - Begin The Beguine (2)\n19 - Dream Dust (2)\n20 - Dark Eyes (2)\n21 - It's Been A Long, Long Time\n22 - Whose Dream Are You \n23 - Hawaiian Paradise\n24 - My Isle Of Gloden Dreams\n25 - Spellbound\n26 - Everybody Knew But Me\n\nCD2\n01 - Baby, What You Do For For Me\n02 - Everybody Knew But Me\n03 - Song Of The Islands\n04 - Sweet Leilani\n05 - Kings Serenade\n06 - To You, Sweetheart, Aloha\n07 - Sweet Hawaiian Moonlight\n08 - Aloha Oe\n09 - Pretending\n10 - Gotta Get Me Somebody To Love\n11 - One-Sided Affair\n12 - What Would It Take \n13 - Rumors Are Flying\n14 - It's A Pity To Say Goodnight\n15 - Steel Guitar Rag\n16 - Guitar Boogie (1)\n17 - Guitar Boogie (2)\n18 - Caravan\n19 - Somebody Loves Me\n20 - Gotta Get Me Somebody To Love\n21 - What Am I Gonna Do About You \n22 - Drifting And Dreaming (Sweet Paradise)\n23 - What Are You Doing For New Years Eve \n24 - My Future Just Passed\n\n*1997 Decca / MCA Records | MCAD2-11708\n\n\nPersonnel: featuring Les Paul, Bing Crosby, Terry Shand, Cal Gooden, Georgia White, Bob Meyer, Dick Haymes, Jud DeNaut, Walter Wechsler, Tom Todd, Laverne Andrews, Maxene Andrews, Patty Andrews, Abe Siegel, Clint Nordquist, Bob Armstrong, Helen Forrest, Irv Kluger, Clint Neagley, Bob Lawson, etc.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
