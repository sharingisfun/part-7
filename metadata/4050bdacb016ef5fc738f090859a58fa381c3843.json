Formed in 1997, they consist of Isam Bachiri (born in Denmark and of Moroccan background), Waqas Ali Qadri (born in Denmark and of Pakistani background), and Lenny Martinez (born in Honduras and is of Cuban and Honduran descent).\n\nOutlandish's hip-hop/R&amp;B/soul music sound takes influences from their various backgrounds (Moroccan/Arab/Amazigh, Pakistani/Punjabi and Latin American), and although their songs are primarily in English, they usually feature lyrics in Spanish, Urdu/Punjabi, Danish, and Arabic.\n\nCloser Than Veins (2005) is Outlandish's third album. The first single was &quot;Look Into My Eyes&quot;. The song's lyrics are based on a poem by Gihad Ali, a Palestinian who wrote the piece when she was a teenager; the poem expresses the plight of those suffering from AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s foreign policy with regards to Israel and Palestine. The video is based around the fairy-tale Little Red Riding Hood. It portrays an Israeli soldier as the Wolf and the Palestinian girl, wearing a Kaffiyeh, as Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nThis album showcased the group's more mature outlook compared to their previous works. Tracks such as &quot;Just Me&quot; and &quot;Una Palabra&quot; give a rare insight into the life in Europe today as seen through the eyes of ethnic minorities, whereas &quot;Nothing Left To Do&quot; perhaps the most daring and compelling track on the album boldly tackles the still taboo ridden issue of a young Muslim man catching HIV:\n\nOutlandish performed a live percussion version of &quot;Look Into My Eyes&quot; at the &quot;Islamophobia&quot; conference held in Copenhagen, Denmark in May 2006 which was hosted by the Islam Channel and included many theological and political speakers and community leaders. Their club thumping single &quot;Kom Igen&quot; is featured on EA's FIFA 2007.\n\nOutlandish included two new (bonus) tracks &quot;In Good Hands&quot; and &quot;Angels Lower Their Wings&quot; on the deluxe version of Closer Than Veins. They were the only Danish act performing at the European MTV Awards 2006, where they also won the prize for Best Danish Act.\n\nCloser Than Veins was released in UK by Sony BMG in March 2007, with &quot;Look Into My Eyes&quot; being released as the first single on 5 March. The UK version of Closer Than Veins included a rendition of Bob Marley's &quot;Redemption Song.&quot;\n\n1. Introspective\n2. Any Given Time\n3. Look Into My Eyes\n4. Just Me\n5. Kom Igen (Feat.
