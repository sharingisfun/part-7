His career as a dramatist produced four classics and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics. Chekhov practised as a doctor throughout most of his literary career: &quot;Medicine is my lawful wife&quot;, he once said, &quot;and literature is my mistress.&quot;\n\nChekhov had at first written stories only for financial gain, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations which have influenced the evolution of the modern short story. His originality consists in an early use of the stream-of-consciousness technique, later adopted by James Joyce and other modernists, combined with a disavowal of the moral finality of traditional story structure. He made no apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers, insisting that the role of an artist was to ask questions, not to answer them.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b264de40e8bdf5041af3a90f79aee02710fe3412","amp;dn":"Anton+Checkhov+-+Stories+and+Short+Novels+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b264de40e8bdf5041af3a90f79aee02710fe3412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,100,222,64,232,189,245,4,26,243,169,15,121,174,224,39,16,254,52,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
