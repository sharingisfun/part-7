He eventually discovers that it is because the bikers had witnessed a political assassination and may be able to identify the men who carried it out.\n\nThe story's location within an Australian bikie gang gives it a unique twist. Road movies were not new, and the popularity of genre had been dramatically demonstrated over the previous few years by the huge popularity of Easy Rider and subsequent films like Two Lane Blacktop and Vanishing Point. But Stone delved much deeper into biker culture than any previous film, and it depicted the Australian biker subculture, which like the local surfing subculture, was significantly different from its overseas counterparts. The clothes, the language, the customs - even the choice of bikes was distinctively Australian. Aussie bikers tended to favour faster and more powerful bikes than their American cousins, and often chose Japanese brands such as Honda, Yamaha and Kawasaki.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072209/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072209/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis has been upped elsewhere but all are seedless and all are over 4GB.\n\nReview by David Zuzelo - http://www.cinema-nocturna.com/stone_review.htm\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff35ccc73a664d3f397ea4aa39828f002d363911","amp;dn":"Stone+%281974%29+Australia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff35ccc73a664d3f397ea4aa39828f002d363911","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,53,204,199,58,102,77,63,57,126,164,170,57,130,143,0,45,54,57,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
