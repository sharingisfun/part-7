In this release we bring you the first Linux Lite packages, Lite Software Center and Lite User Manager. There is a host of new features, including the 3.8 kernel from the Hardware Enablement Stack for better hardware support, new install scripts for webcams, a PAE kernel installer (32-bit) and a basic Games Pack installer. There is also now an option to add the Whisker Menu to the taskbar. This release also sneaks in at under CD size. A word about the offering of the 3.8 kernel. As this is the last build in the 1.0 LTS series, we wanted to offer people more hardware support. The 3.2 kernel is fairly old now, and Linux Lite 2.0 is bound to be sporting a very up-to-date kernel come release time circa May or June 2014.&quot; Here is the release announcement with a screenshot.
