Steering clear of ham-handed attempts to be commercially &quot;new wave&quot; while at the same time sounding young, bright and alive, the foursome go happily nuts with great results. Cope is already a commanding singer and frontman; his clever lyrics and strong projection result in a series of confident performances, whether his trading lines with himself on the motorik chug of &quot;Sleeping Gas&quot; or his yelps on &quot;Books.&quot; For all the bad energy between himself and Balfe, the two sound like they're grafted at the hip throughout, the latter's keyboard washes and staccato melodies adding the fun, nervy vibe. Dwyer's spot-on drumming keeps the pace, while both guitarists, Finkler and his replacement Gill, don't drown the band in feedback to the exclusion of everything else. One listen to many of Gill's pieces, on songs like &quot;Poppies,&quot; and Cope's oft-stated claim that early U2 was trying to rip off the Teardrops and other Liverpool/Manchester groups makes sense. Though it was assembled from a variety of different sessions Kilimanjaro still sounds cohesive. Perfectly hummable choruses, great arrangements and production and Cope's smiling vibe all add up with fantastic results. The sweet romance of &quot;When I Dream&quot; closes out this entertaining debut.\n[IMG]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/IMG]\n\nDisc One\n\n    * 1.
