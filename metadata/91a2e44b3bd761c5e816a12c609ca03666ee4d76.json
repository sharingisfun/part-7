Cross endless streets with cars and trucks coming from everywhere. He&amp;#039;s armed with all new moves, a power croak, a heat-seeking tongue, and a super jump! The only difference is he is lost in a dfferent world filled with hungry enemies such as crocodiles, lawnmowers, turtles, and snakes.\nESRB Rating: E for Animated Violence\nGenre: Platformer\n\nA great nostalgic game for anybody who&amp;#039;s played Frogger 3D by Hasbro Interactive back in the day, with &quot;Ground Breaking&quot; 3-d graphics and a huge range of fun stages!\n\nThis is a complete ISO rip of the original game CD. There is no crack (especially since most of the game info is read from the disc during play) so I would recommend you burn this onto a CD to play it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91a2e44b3bd761c5e816a12c609ca03666ee4d76","amp;dn":"hasbro.interactive.1997.frogger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91a2e44b3bd761c5e816a12c609ca03666ee4d76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,162,228,75,59,215,97,197,232,22,161,44,96,156,160,54,102,238,77,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
