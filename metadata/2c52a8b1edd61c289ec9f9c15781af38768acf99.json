Monty Python was just around the corner. In this first volume of his diaries, he tells for the first time how Python emerged and triumphed. Perceptive and funny, it chronicles not only his struggle to find a niche in the world of television comedy, but also the extraordinary goings on of the many powerful personalities who coalesced to form the Monty Python team.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!\n\n\n\nPS:  Not brilliant quality rip but best I could find!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c52a8b1edd61c289ec9f9c15781af38768acf99","amp;dn":"The+Monty+Python+Years+-+Michael+Palin++%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c52a8b1edd61c289ec9f9c15781af38768acf99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,82,168,177,237,214,28,40,158,201,249,193,87,129,175,56,118,138,207,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
