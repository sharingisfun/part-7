Oakland's MC Zumbi and DJ/producer Amp Live blend hip-hop and trip-hop beats with lyrics focused on a message of unity, hope, and spiritual awareness. After a couple of indie hits, the trio slowly made inroads while opening for rap royalty like De La Soul, Rakim, and Run-D.M.C. Their debut album, Mind Over Matter, was released in May of 2000 and features collaborations with fellow Bay Area rappers Rasco, Planet Asia, and the Grouch. Although Zion I operates out of Berkeley, the group was originally formed in Atlanta, making their music difficult to classify as strictly West Coast hip-hop. Their musical style makes them even harder to define. With a style that borrows from hip-hop, trance, drum'n'bass, and reggae, Zion I's style is equally mystical and mystifying.\n\nIncluded albums:\n-Deep Water Slang\n-Heroes In The City Of Dope\n-Mind Over Matter\n-Rainydayz Remixes\n-Science of Breath Vol. 2\n-Street Legends\n-The Take Over\n-True And Livin'\n\n\nENJOY!\n\n-live4rain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45f1c4730c80764f3bb35cddac997a2769313200","amp;dn":"Zion+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45f1c4730c80764f3bb35cddac997a2769313200","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,241,196,115,12,128,118,79,59,179,92,221,172,153,122,39,105,49,50,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
