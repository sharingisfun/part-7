This was a new country; in Vietnam, Now, David Lamb brings it--and us--forward from its dark, distant past. \r\n\r\n From the myriad personalities entwined in the dark, distant history of the war to those focused toward the future, Lamb reveals a rich and culturally diverse people as they share their memories of the country's past, and their hopes for a peacetime future. A portrait of a beautiful country and a remarkable, determined people, Vietnam, Now is a personal journey that will change the way we think of Vietnam, and perhaps the war as well","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e689d5386773b5c55742fb61d4daf679ad0c81e","amp;dn":"David+Lamb+-+Vietnam+Now+A+Reporter+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e689d5386773b5c55742fb61d4daf679ad0c81e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,104,157,83,134,119,59,92,85,116,47,182,29,77,175,103,154,208,200,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
