After the war, Hortense, now a qualified teacher, makes a marriage of convenience to Gilbert Joseph, paying for his passage to England on condition he sends for her. She not only hopes to see Michael again but believes that living in Britain will give her more scope. When she arrives in London in 1948, she is extremely disappointed by the one room in which they must live and the obvious colour prejudice. Queenie, their liberal landlady, is also a woman used to disappointment, marrying decent but dull Bernard to get her away from the family farm.\n\nIMDb RATING: 7.6/10 (130 votes)\n\nVideo: ID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 2h 46mn\nBit rate : 438 Kbps\nWidth : 680 pixels\nHeight : 340 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.000\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\n\nAudio: ID : 1\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nCodec ID : 2000\nDuration : 2h 46mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 224 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : L R\n\nDuration : 1:46\nLanguage : English\n\ncredit Xclusive666 BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc29242e9d80df4bc2deff5d7f8419184ae313bc","amp;dn":"Small+Island+2009+DVDRip+XviD+LKRG%5BExtraTorrent%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc29242e9d80df4bc2deff5d7f8419184ae313bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,41,36,46,157,128,223,75,194,222,255,93,127,132,25,24,74,227,19,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
