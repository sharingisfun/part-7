Possibly analogous to a broader picture of existence or even modern India, this compelling tale traces the deteriorating life of an old country nobleman. He lives in the past, in a slowly decaying villa, and cannot adjust to the fast-changing, vastly different modern world that surrounds him on all sides. Melancholy and inward-turning, he remembers the grand old days of societal soirÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©es and political power and mourns the death of his wife and his son, deaths which he survived only to live alone in a house filled with memories. In a last-gasp effort, the old man opts for one grand gesture to recall past glories.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Jalsaghar.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.14 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate : 1726 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 8.29 MiB\n      Movie name : Jalsaghar (1958) aka The Music Room\n      Director : Satyajit Ray\n      Genre : Drama\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Copyright : dvdrip by therthe\n      Comment : therthe for livekino and someone  else\n      Product : Movie\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate : 1594 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.215\n      StreamSize : 1.04 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate : 126 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 84.9 MiB\n      Writing library : Xing (new)\n\nIMDB: tt0051792\n\nBengali audio, English, Spanish, French, Portuguese and Italian subtitles (srt)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9611c5e7bbd77875dbf84a9cb79633932b4898c","amp;dn":"Jalsaghar+%28The+Music+Room%29+-+Satyajit+Ray+%281958%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9611c5e7bbd77875dbf84a9cb79633932b4898c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,97,28,94,123,189,119,135,93,191,132,169,203,121,99,57,50,180,137,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
