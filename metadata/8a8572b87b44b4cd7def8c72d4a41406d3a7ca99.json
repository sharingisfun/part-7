Join Hahn as he follows the high adventure of God's plan for the ages, beginning with Adam and Eve and continuing down through the generations to the coming of Christ and the birth of the Church. You'll discover how the patient love of the Father revealed in the Bible is the same persistent love he has for you.\n\n---\n\n&quot;For years Scott Hahn has told audiences about God's covenant love and its implications in their lives, and for years his friends have nagged him to reduce his remarks to writing....Now we have that book, and now we can see clearly why Hahn affirms that the only tragedy in life is not being a saint.&quot; --Karl Keating, Catholic Answers\n\n&quot;Scott Hahn's central idea of covenant and kinship (family) proves to be a Rosetta Stone for Scriptural hieroglyphics, and a disarmingly simple one at that. Once you have glanced through this lens, you will never see the big picture of salvation history in the same way again....I know of no more authentically Biblical, more reliably Catholic, or more exciting theologian in the world today than Scott Hahn.&quot; --Peter Kreeft, Professor of Philosophy, Boston College\n\n---\n\nFormat: 7 MP3s totaling 8.5 hours (split to Audio CD size)\n\neBook is included in a ZIP file in EPUB/MOBI/OPF/PDF formats.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/ancapcatholic/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/ancapcatholic/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBTC: 1N3Y2HNWe3xWY4qdYricHRKz58zqqi5MZp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a8572b87b44b4cd7def8c72d4a41406d3a7ca99","amp;dn":"Scott+Hahn+-+A+Father+Who+Keeps+His+Promises+%28Unabridged+%2B+book%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a8572b87b44b4cd7def8c72d4a41406d3a7ca99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,133,114,184,123,68,180,205,125,239,140,114,212,164,20,6,211,167,202,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
