The extended version of MÃƒÂ¤n som hatar kvinnor [Part 1] (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) is 34 minutes longer than the theatrical release. The extended version of Flickan som lekte med elden [Part 2] (The Girl Who Played with Fire) is 56 minutes longer than the theatrical version, and the extended version of Luftslottet som sprÃƒÂ¤ngdes [Part 3] (The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest) is 39 minutes longer than the theatrical version. \n\nAlso included are extras from the extended version DVD. The bonus materials, which include interviews and other behind the scenes footage that I put together, were from a non-bluray source and therefore are NOT in 720p, but I included them anyway for those who might appreciate it.\n\nMy bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on &quot;normal&quot; sized monitors and low enough to keep the download speeds short and file size small enough for those who keep large collections of movies on their hard drives. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you're going to need one of the larger, higher bitrate torrents. For large screen TVs, I recommend bitrates of at least 2500 for 720p's and 5000 for 1080p's. \n\nPlease seed for as long as possible after completing your download. I recommend seeding until your share ratio is at least 3:1 in order to maximize this torrent's availability to others. Thank you.
