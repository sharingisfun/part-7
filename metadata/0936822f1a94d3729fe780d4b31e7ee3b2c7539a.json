Gross (Springer, 2004).pdf\r\n\r\nMass Spectrometry is an ideal textbook for students and professionals as well as newcomers to the field. Starting from the very first principles of gas-phase ion chemistry and isotopic properties, the textbook takes the reader through the design of mass analyzers and ionization methods all the way to mass spectral interpretation and coupling techniques. Step-by-step, the reader learns how mass spectrometry works and what it can do. The book comprises a balanced mixture of practice-oriented information and theoretical background. It features a clear layout and a wealth of high-quality figures. Exercises and solutions are located on the Springer Global Web","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0936822f1a94d3729fe780d4b31e7ee3b2c7539a","amp;dn":"Mass+Spectrometry+-+A+Textbook+-+J%26uuml%3Brgen+H.+Gross","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0936822f1a94d3729fe780d4b31e7ee3b2c7539a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,54,130,47,26,148,211,114,159,231,128,212,179,30,126,227,178,199,83,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
