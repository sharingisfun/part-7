Hyatt, &quot;The Psychopath's Bible: For the Extreme Individual&quot;\nEnglish | 2009 | ISBN: 1935150324 | 224 pages | PDF | 8 MB\n\nIn the most of the world, psychopaths have gotten a bad rap. That, of course, is quite understandable since almost all of the world's religious and social philosophies have little use for the individual except as a tool to be placed in service to their notion of something else: 'God,' or the 'collective,' or the 'higher good' or some other equally undefinable term. Only rarely, such as in Zen; in Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism; in some aspects of Tibetan Buddhism and Hinduism; and in some schools of Existentialism, is the individual considered primal. Here, finally, is a book which celebrates, encourages and educates the best part of ourselves --- The Psychopath.\n\nThis second revised edition includes over 100 pages of new 'workbook' material including exercises, 'tests' and techniques.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e916ceed460bc3454651ed54cf00a7a04d9081fb","amp;dn":"The+Psychopath%27s+Bible+For+the+Extreme+Individual.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e916ceed460bc3454651ed54cf00a7a04d9081fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,22,206,237,70,11,195,69,70,81,237,84,207,0,167,160,77,144,129,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
