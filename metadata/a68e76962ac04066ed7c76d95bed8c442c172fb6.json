Told in a sentimental tone, Burns weaves a lyrical tale of the great metropolis that encompasses not only the city&amp;#039;s streets, but also that of the history of America. Though around fourteen hours in length, this epic documentary presents a thoughtful, entertaining look at our relatively young country.\n\nI have a very slow connection so please share and if you can upload it to file storing servers that&amp;#039;s even better. Just add links in comments.\n\n\n\n\nxxxyyyzzz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a68e76962ac04066ed7c76d95bed8c442c172fb6","amp;dn":"New+York%2C+A+Documentary+Film+-+08+-+Center+Of+The+World+CD1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a68e76962ac04066ed7c76d95bed8c442c172fb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,142,118,150,42,192,64,102,237,124,118,217,91,237,140,68,44,23,47,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
