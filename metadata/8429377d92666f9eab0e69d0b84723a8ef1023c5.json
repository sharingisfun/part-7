However, this current group is imbued with the cultural heritage that the bass player took time exploring in the mid-2000s, when he returned to his homeland to reconnect with his ancestral roots Yemenite on his mother s side and Moroccan on his father's. With Omer Avital, the integration of jazz with the musical traditions of the Arab world is more than just a convenient meeting. It is the fruit of the assimilation of two cultures, an assimilation so strong that New Song resonates with endless colours and rhythms, joyfully combining ritual music with Afro-American grooves, linking the phrasing of Eastern melodies with the fervour of gospel and the expressiveness of soul. From the trance of Gnaouas to the funky warmth of Jazz Messengers, Yemenite songs with the workshop spirit of Charles Mingus, his musicians are at one with him as they effortlessly and joyfully leap from one genre to another.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Hafla\n 02 - New Song\n 03 - Tsafdina\n 04 - Avishkes\n 05 - Sabah El-Kheir (Good Morning)\n 06 - New Middle East\n 07 - Maroc\n 08 - Ballad For A Friend\n 09 - Bedouin Roots\n 10 - Yemen Suite\n 11 - Small Time Shit\n\n Produced by Sebastien Vidal.\n\nMusicians:\n Omer Avital - bass\n Avishai Cohen - trumpet\n Joel Frahm - tenor saxophone\n Yonathan Avishai - piano\n Daniel Freedman - drums\n\n\nSidmal: this is a fine and completely mature contemporary jazz album...a great performer at his prime!!! my recommendation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8429377d92666f9eab0e69d0b84723a8ef1023c5","amp;dn":"Omer+Avital+-+New+Song+%282014%29+%5BFLAC+24%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8429377d92666f9eab0e69d0b84723a8ef1023c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,41,55,125,146,102,111,158,171,14,105,208,184,71,35,168,239,16,35,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
