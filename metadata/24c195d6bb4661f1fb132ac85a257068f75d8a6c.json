They and their successors created modern paintingÃ¢â‚¬â€an extraordinarily varied, imaginative, and often surprising and bewildering art field. Here, presented concisely in words and pictures, is the story of that revolution and its significance in the world of art. The author, assistant curator of the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris, covers modern painting from its beginnings to todayÃ¢â‚¬â€from Cezanne, the first of the great revolutionaries, to Fauvism, Cubism and Surrealism, from Expressionism, Impressionism and Abstraction to Action Painting, Pop Art and Op Art. The book contains over 220 illustrations, many in full color","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24c195d6bb4661f1fb132ac85a257068f75d8a6c","amp;dn":"Modern+Painting%3A+From+its+Beginnings+to+Today","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24c195d6bb4661f1fb132ac85a257068f75d8a6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,193,149,214,187,70,97,241,251,19,42,200,90,37,112,104,247,93,138,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
