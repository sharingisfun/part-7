Among the nine people he lives with are: a father, who is suffering from malnutrition and a fatal illness; a brother, who is a former Nazi soldier hiding to avoid arrest; and a sister, who has turned to prostitution. Scouring the rubble-strewn city for food, money, and cigarettes, he comes upon a former teacher, Herr Enning (Erich Guhne), who evinces a barely restrained sexual attraction to the boy while providing him with records of Hitler's speeches that can be bartered on the black market. He also drums into the boy a classic piece of Nazi propaganda about the importance of having the courage to let the weak be destroyed. Under his influence, the confused young protagonist heads down a tragic path. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039417/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039417/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSubs\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-39417/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-39417/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:10:49\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480  4:3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1155 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,15 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 112 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f4cde8e87e266e52288c0b2488a118a3569b95c","amp;dn":"Germany+Year+Zero+%281948%29+Roberto+Rossellini+It%2CEngsubt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f4cde8e87e266e52288c0b2488a118a3569b95c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,76,222,142,135,226,102,229,34,136,192,178,72,138,17,138,53,105,185,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
