This time he's attempting to build his own beach getaway on the English coast, testing a basic hypothesis - is simple better? And is creating better than consuming? Kevin moves his entire shed to the sublime Somerset Jurassic coast. This stunning location brings fresh adventures for him as he transforms his beloved cabin into the beach home of his dreams while using locally available resources and other people's junk. Kevin uncovers inventive building materials in remarkable places and experiments with novel off-grid energy sources - all so that he can sit out on his porch as the sun goes down, listen to the sound of the crashing waves and sip a cocktail featuring his own home-made rum.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nKevin salvages the oak ribs from a shipwrecked fishing boat to build a curvaceous, gravity-defying clifftop deck on which he can spend the summer al fresco. To light his seaside retreat, Kevin taps into an unusual energy supply residing in the waves, in the form of fish oil. And in a madcap dash to the local pub, Kevin hits the high seas with his Man Friday, Will Trickett, on a raft made from inflated sheepskin balloons. But between them and the perfect pint are the strong currents of the Bristol Channel.\n\n2)  Part 2 \nKevin builds a sun lounge for his beach hut, his own hammock to lie in and some lobster traps made out of old shopping trolleys to go fishing with. Kevin sets about doubling the floor space by building a beautiful, glistening sun lounge out of recycled windows culled from lorries and aeroplanes, coming up with a crafty design that floats the windows in mid air. Kevin also wants his own hammock to lie in and uses a massive anchor to build a giant-sized hammock that rotates, allowing him to chase the sun across the sky at the turn of a wheel. In search of more junk he can recycle, Kevin takes a dirty dive into London's oldest dock and discovers a haul of old shopping trolleys that he re-purposes into lobster pots.\n\n3)  Part 3 \nIt's the height of summer and Kevin McCloud's simple shed has already been transformed with the addition of a cliff top terrace and a sun room made from old lorry and airplane windows. Now Kevin plans to take his off-grid beach build to an entirely new level with a magnificent observation tower, three times higher than a double decker bus. Kevin also wants to enhance his cooking facilities and make an amazing barbecue by re-purposing a World War Two naval mine. Spectacularly, Kevin opts to form the barbecue by blasting the mine in half with a huge explosive charge.\n\n4)  Part 4 \nAs the nights draw in and the summer begins to fade, Kevin looks to add a final touch to his coastal retreat. With the main structure of the cabin finished, Kevin wants to improve his quality of life and introduce a few of life's little luxuries, with his very own solar powered hot water shower made from a repurposed telephone box and a sublime floating beach bar made largely from flotsam and jetsam found on his beach. And no holiday by the sea can be complete without ice cream. So Kevin churns his very own goats' milk ice cream featuring a seaweed sprinkles and caramel topping.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/6047/pe20.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/6047/pe20.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/1080/tsdp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/1080/tsdp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/1090/hbpw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/1090/hbpw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/2049/5tbb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/2049/5tbb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/2667/w4d4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/2667/w4d4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/5853/hkcl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/5853/hkcl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/931/u3nl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/931/u3nl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/2431/k3iq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/2431/k3iq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/6555/hco4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/6555/hco4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5f173638371f136c716f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1967 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832x468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 48mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: average 662 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/kevin-mcclouds-man-made-home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/kevin-mcclouds-man-made-home&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Man%20Made%20Home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Man%20Made%20Home&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57de5084a84809e6a2f4938271a1e5a7b6630ea9","amp;dn":"Ch4+Kevin+McClouds+Man+Made+Home+Series+2+4of4+PDTV+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57de5084a84809e6a2f4938271a1e5a7b6630ea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,222,80,132,168,72,9,230,162,244,147,130,113,161,229,167,182,99,14,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
