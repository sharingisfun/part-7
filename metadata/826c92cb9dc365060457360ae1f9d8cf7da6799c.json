The opera revolves around the happenings, socially and psychologically, of an English teenager during 1965. Upon its release the album peaked at number 2 in both the US and UK charts, featuring hit singles &quot;5.15&quot; &quot;Love, Reign O'er Me&quot; and &quot;The Real Me&quot;. Digitally remastered and expanded Super Deluxe edition of this 1973 concept album by the British Rock icons contains a unique insight into the creation of this landmark album and features a remaster of the original double album, Pete Townshend's previously unheard demos including songs that didn't make it onto the original album.\n\n\n Pete Townshend revisited the rock opera concept with another double-album opus, this time built around the story of a young mod's struggle to come of age in the mid-'60s. If anything, this was a more ambitious project than Tommy, given added weight by the fact that the Who weren't devising some fantasy but were re-examining the roots of their own birth in mod culture. In the end, there may have been too much weight, as Townshend tried to combine the story of a mixed-up mod named Jimmy with the examination of a four-way split personality (hence the title Quadrophenia), in turn meant to reflect the four conflicting personas at work within the Who itself. The concept might have ultimately been too obscure and confusing for a mass audience. But there's plenty of great music anyway, especially on &quot;The Real Me,&quot; &quot;The Punk Meets the Godfather,&quot; &quot;I'm One,&quot; &quot;Bell Boy,&quot; and &quot;Love, Reign o'er Me.&quot; Some of Townshend's most direct, heartfelt writing is contained here, and production-wise it's a tour de force, with some of the most imaginative use of synthesizers on a rock record. Various members of the band griped endlessly about flaws in the mix, but really these will bug very few listeners, who in general will find this to be one of the Who's most powerful statements.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\nPart I - Original Album Version\n 01 - I Am the Sea\n 02 - The Real Me\n 03 - Quadrophenia\n 04 - Cut My Hair\n 05 - The Punk and the Godfather\n 06 - I'm One\n 07 - The Dirty Jobs\n 08 - Helpless Dancer\n 09 - Is It In My Head?\n 10 - I've Had Enough\n 11 - 5:15\n 12 - Sea and Sand\n 13 - Drowned\n 14 - Bell Boy\n 15 - Doctor Jimmy\n 16 - The Rock\n 17 - Love Reign O'er Me\n\nPart II - Demos (Pete Townshend)\n 18 - The Real Me\n 19 - Quadrophenia - 4 Overtures\n 20 - Cut My Hair\n 21 - Fill No' 1 - Get Out and Stay Out\n 22 - Quadrophenic Four Faces\n 23 - We Close Tonight\n 24 - You Came Back\n 25 - Get Inside\n 26 - Joker James\n 27 - Punk\n 28 - I'm One\n 29 - Dirty Jobs\n 30 - Helpless Dancer\n 31 - Is It In My Head?\n 32 - Any More\n 33 - Fill No' 2\n 34 - I've Had Enough\n 35 - Wizardry\n 36 - Sea and Sand\n 37 - Drowned\n 38 - Is It Me?\n 39 - Bell Boy\n 40 - Doctor Jimmy\n 41 - Finale - The Rock\n 42 - Love Reign O'er Me","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:826c92cb9dc365060457360ae1f9d8cf7da6799c","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+Quadrophenia+%281973%2F2014%29+%5BSuper+Deluxe+Edition%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"826c92cb9dc365060457360ae1f9d8cf7da6799c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,108,146,203,157,195,101,6,4,87,54,10,225,249,216,207,125,166,121,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
