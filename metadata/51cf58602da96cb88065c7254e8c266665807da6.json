But itâ€™s not beyond what you can do these days! and this course will guide you step-by-step through the process.\r\n\r\nThis course is made for absolute beginners. No prior programming knowledge is required to take this course. The main goal of the course is to give you a quick exposure to the full development stack, using JavaScript, as opposed to the usual approach of learning one thing at a time and never getting a â€œbig pictureâ€ view.\r\n\r\nThese are the exciting topics we teach in the course:\r\n\r\nHTML\r\nCSS\r\nResponsive web design\r\nJavaScript\r\nDOM access and manipulation\r\nMeteor to build web applications\r\nMongoDB to store and query your data\r\nThe course follows a project-based approach. Concepts are introduce as we need them to build our social network project. We strongly believe this is the best approach for people who are starting web development and want a quick look at the entire process, instead of covering each topic in depth right away.\r\n\r\nPablo Farias Navarro is a software developer and founder of ZENVA. Pablo has been programming since 1996 and has taught programming to over 100k students. By following our usual project-based approach, by the end of this course youâ€™ll have the skills to create solid web applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51cf58602da96cb88065c7254e8c266665807da6","amp;dn":"Udemy+Meteor+JS++Creating+a+Social+Network+-sept+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51cf58602da96cb88065c7254e8c266665807da6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,207,88,96,45,169,108,184,128,101,199,37,78,140,38,102,101,128,125,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
