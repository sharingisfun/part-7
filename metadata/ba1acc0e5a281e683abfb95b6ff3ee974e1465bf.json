This is not a complete collection, but rather what I've been able to scrape from torrents and other sites.  Unfortunately only the N3 category has a book and CD dedicated to the listening portion of the exam, as well as a book dedicated to practice tests and strategies.  That being said, no matter which exam you're looking to take, these resources will certainly help you prepare!\n\n(Please note that the N4 guides are named &quot;Nihongo Challenge&quot; rather than &quot;Nihongo Sou Matome - it isn't a different run of books, just that the publisher made things odd with the title.)\n\nAs always, if you have something that's missing, be righteous and make a torrent and put the link in the comments!  :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba1acc0e5a281e683abfb95b6ff3ee974e1465bf","amp;dn":"Nihongo+Sou+Matome+Collection+%28N4-N1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba1acc0e5a281e683abfb95b6ff3ee974e1465bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,26,204,14,90,40,30,104,58,191,185,91,111,243,238,151,78,20,101,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
