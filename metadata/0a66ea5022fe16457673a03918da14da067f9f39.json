This sense of our self may seem\nincredibly real but a wealth of recent scientific evidence reveals that\nit is not what it seems--it is all an illusion. In The Self Illusion, Bruce\nHood reveals how the self emerges during childhood and how the\narchitecture of the developing brain enables us to become social\nanimals dependent on each other. Humans spend proportionally the\ngreatest amount of time in childhood compared to any other animal.\nIt's not only to learn from others, Hood notes, but also to learn to\nbecome like others. We learn to become our self. Even as adults\nwe are continually developing and elaborating this story, learning to\nbecome different selves in different situations--the work self, the\nhome self, the parent self.\n\nThe Self Illusion:\nWhy There is No 'You' Inside Your Head\nBy: Bruce M.
