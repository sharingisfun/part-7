What Crisis?, Even in the Quietest Moments, Breakfast in America, ...Famous Last Words..., and Brother Where You Bound.\n\nThis album's unique cover art showed a suit-wearing, faceless man seated in a train carriage reading a book with his own face on the cover. The view from the train window shows the platform with stylised versions of the cover art from three of Supertramp's previous albums.\n\n\n1.  Goodbye Stranger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n2.
