Some TAR archives use the binary size format instead of octal for files larger than 8 GB.\nBugs fixed:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Repair&quot; command failed to properly reconstruct structure of RAR archives, which contained at least one file with packed size exceeding 4 GB. This bug did not affect the recovery record based repair. It happened only if recovery record was not found and WinRAR performed reconstruction of archive structure\nÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Even if &quot;Do not extract paths&quot; option in &quot;Advanced&quot; part of extraction dialog was set as the default, WinRAR still unpacked file paths if called from Explorer context menu\nÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ After entering a wrong password for encrypted ZIP archive, sometimes WinRAR ignored subsequent attempts to enter a valid password\nÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Wizard&quot; command did not allow to create self-extracting and multivolume archives, when compressing a single folder or a file without extension\nÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Import settings from file&quot; command did not restore multiline comments in WinRAR compression profiles\nÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ When converting RAR volumes having name1.name2.part#.rar name format, &quot;Convert archives&quot; command erroneously removed &quot;.name2&quot; name part. So resulting archive had name1.rar file name instead of expected name1.name2.rar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ RAR could crash when creating a new archive with -agNNN switch if archive number in generated name was 110 or larger\nÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ WinRAR failed to display non-English file names in 7-Zip archives properly if they used a non-default code page. It was the display only problem, such names were unpacked correctly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be4d8beae3411d2ffa01e9982a6852bbf0472035","amp;dn":"WinRAR+4.01+32bit+and+64bit+Pre+Registered%7Bfiesta569%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be4d8beae3411d2ffa01e9982a6852bbf0472035","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,77,139,234,227,65,29,47,250,1,233,152,42,104,82,187,240,71,32,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
