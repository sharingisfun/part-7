IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m an amateur at this but since no Scene group has seen fit to release them I thought IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d better share. These were made to fit with the DEMAND 720p release so that everything could fit on 1 BD-R disc.\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the .mka files (the commentaries) they are just the audio track from an .mkv file and can be remuxed (joined) with whichever True Detective release you have. There is a great free program out there called MkvToolNix (aka MkvMerge) that you can use to remux these commentaries into Episodes 4 and 5. Be warned that the program doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look simple when you first start it but is quite easy to use for doing something like this. You'll be happy you learned how to use it. Enjoy! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:433f2920257733505601098a8e9cbfc2e1b5215f","amp;dn":"True+Detective+S01+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"433f2920257733505601098a8e9cbfc2e1b5215f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,63,41,32,37,119,51,80,86,1,9,138,142,156,191,194,225,181,33,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
