The rest of the forming lineup included Ryan Sinn (The Distillers) and Atom Willard (Rocket from the Crypt/The Offspring). Ryan Sinn was asked to leave in 2007 and his replacement, Matt Wachter (30 Seconds to Mars), completed what was the definitive lineup of Angels &amp; Airwaves. Atom Willard amicably left the band after the recording of their 4th album &quot;LOVE part II&quot; to explore other musical ventures, his replacement is Ilan Rubin (from Nine Inch Nails), which completes the current lineup.\n\nThe works from 2006-2012:\n\n[2006] We Don't Need to Whisper\n[2007] I-Empire\n[2010] LOVE\n[2011] LOVE part II\n[2012] Stomping the Phantom Brake Pedal - EP\n\nTo find out more about the band: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_%26_Airwaves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cf617d8f9a633578822443e418e86df0563a68d","amp;dn":"Angels+and+Airwaves+Discography+%282006-12%29+%5BFLAC%2Fmp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cf617d8f9a633578822443e418e86df0563a68d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,246,23,216,249,166,51,87,136,34,68,62,65,142,134,223,5,99,166,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
