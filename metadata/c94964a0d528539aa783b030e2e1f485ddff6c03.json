Initially associated with the English punk rock scene, the band rapidly evolved to create &quot;a form of post-punk discord full of daring rhythmic and sonic experimentation&quot;.[1] The Times cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as &quot;one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era.&quot;[1]\n\nThe group also became inspirational in the creation and development of the gothic rock genre, and their music also combined elements of pop and avant-garde. The Banshees disbanded in 1996, with Siouxsie and drummer Budgie continuing to record music as The Creatures, a second band they had formed in the early 1980s. In 2004, Siouxsie began a solo career. \n\n\n\n\nGold 2005\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\nDear Prudence\nHong Kong Garden\nCities In Dust\nPeek-A-Boo\nHappy House\nKiss Them For Me\nFace To Face\nDizzy\nIsrael\nChristine\nSpellbound\nStargazer\nArabian Knights\nThe Killing Jar\nThis Wheel's On Fire\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\nSpellbound (Extended 12&quot; Version)\nSong From The Edge Of The World (Columbus Mix)\nKiss Them For Me (Kathak #2 Mix)\nPeek-A-Boo (Silver Dollar Mix)\nThe Killing Jar (Lepidopteristic Mix)\nCities In Dust (Eruption Mix)\nDazzle (Glamour Mix)\nStargazer (Mambo Sun Remix)\nFace To Face (Catatonic Mix)\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c94964a0d528539aa783b030e2e1f485ddff6c03","amp;dn":"Siouxie+and+The+Banshees+-+Greatest+Hits+2005+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c94964a0d528539aa783b030e2e1f485ddff6c03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,73,100,160,213,40,83,154,167,131,176,48,226,225,244,133,221,255,108,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
