Some are of them were real - some are altered into pure Legend. These legends usually had somebody doing villainous deeds. The even greater thing is that most of these were surrounded in mystery or conspiracy.\r\nMedieval Murder Mysteries uses modern thinking from historical police criminology combined with forensics and human osteologists blended with current historical ideas to try and solve what really happened all those years ago. Magnificent castles, chivalrous knights, powerful kings and queens? You'll have them. Also require dark deeds, illicit lovers, greedy nobles, mad cardinals? Look no further. They're all here.\r\n\r\n\r\n4)  Amy Dudley: The Queen, her Lover and his Wife \r\nThe name Amy Robsart may not resonate through the ages, but the unfortunate woman was the victim in a scandal and a mystery that stains the reign of Queen Elizabeth I to this day. Robsart was the wife of Robert Dudley, the favourite and alleged lover of the Queen and the man she is said to have told she would marry - if only he was free to do so. What a shame for them both then that Amy was a robust 28 year old - until she was found at the foot of the stairs at Cumnor Place, her home in Oxfordshire in 1560. Her death caused a scandal - with the finger of blame pointed firmly at Dudley. What is the truth about Amy's tragic death?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1d/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c6/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/07/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a3/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0f/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0a/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3155 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,003 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.historychannel.com.au/tv-shows/1919/medieval-murder-mysteries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:176758b3e57bd77838bde0b9d154ad59a51ce053","amp;dn":"Medieval+Murder+Mysteries+Series+1+4of6+Amy+Dudley+720p+x264+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"176758b3e57bd77838bde0b9d154ad59a51ce053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,103,88,179,229,123,215,120,56,189,224,185,209,84,173,89,165,28,224,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
