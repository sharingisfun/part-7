This hardscrabble tale, only enhanced by her Alaskan upbringing, stood in direct contrast to the sweet, gentle hits Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who Will Save Your Soul,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Were Meant for Me,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Foolish GamesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from her 1995 debut Pieces of You, songs that never suggested a tough background. Nevertheless, Jewel's sensitive side and blue-collar beginnings served her well over the years: once her books of poetry started to fade and her pop makeover fizzled, she was able to capitalize on her back-story and refashion herself as a modern country singer. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t94.06% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalogue:\t\tR2 534620\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Who Will Save Your Soul\n02.You Were Meant For Me (Album Edit)\n03.Foolish Games\n04.Hands\n05.Down So Long\n06.Jupiter (Swallow The Moon) (Single Version)\n07.Standing Still\n08.Break Me (Radio Remix)\n09.Intuition\n10.Good Day\n11.Stronger Woman (Radio Edit)\n12.Somewhere Over The Rainbow\n13.Satisfied (Radio Edit)\n14.You Were Meant For Me (Feat.
