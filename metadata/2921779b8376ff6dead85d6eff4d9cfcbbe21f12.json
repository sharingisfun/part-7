But in the hands of acclaimed comedy writer and scholar Eric Kaplan, a search for the truth about old St. Nick becomes a deeply insightful, laugh-out-loud discussion of the way some things exist but may not really be there. Just like Santa and his reindeer.\n\n Even after we outgrow the jolly fellow, the essential paradox persists: There are some things we dearly believe in that are not universally acknowledged as real. In Does Santa Exist? Kaplan shows how philosophy giants Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein strove to smooth over this uncomfortable meeting of the real and unrealÃ¢â‚¬â€and failed. From there he turns to mysticismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attempts to resolve such paradoxes, surveying Buddhism, Taoism, early Christianity, Theosophy, and even the philosophers at UC Berkeley under whom he studied. Finally, this brilliant comic writer alights onÃ¢â‚¬â€surpriseÃ¢â‚¬â€comedy as the ultimate resolution of the fundamental paradoxes of life, using examples from The Big Bang Theory, Monty PythonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cheese shop sketch, and many other pop-culture sources.\n\n Finally Kaplan delves deeper into what this means, from how our physical brains work to his own personal confrontations with lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest questions: If weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all going to die, whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the point of anything? What is a perfect moment? What can you say about God? Or Santa?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2921779b8376ff6dead85d6eff4d9cfcbbe21f12","amp;dn":"Does+Santa+Exist%3F%3A+A+Philosophical+Investigation+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2921779b8376ff6dead85d6eff4d9cfcbbe21f12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,33,119,155,131,118,255,109,234,216,93,110,255,77,156,252,187,226,31,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
