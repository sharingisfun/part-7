Spanning two discs and 37 tracks, the set contains all 18 songs from 2001's The Very Best of Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates, which was a single-disc, 18-track collection that contained all of the duo's big hits from the '70s and '80s (three tracks were in alternate single mixes on that collection; they're presented in their original album mixes here), along with &quot;She's Gone&quot; (absent on The Very Best) and two other Atlantic tracks from the early '70s, selections from their Arista recordings of the late '80s and early '90s, as well as cuts from 1997's Marigold Sky and 2003's excellent comeback single, &quot;Do It for Love.&quot; While there are still plenty of great album tracks, particularly from the Atlantic years, that would have been welcome additions, that's something only the hardcore fans who already have all the albums will quibble about. For the less dedicated listener, all that matters is that there are no major hits missing on The Essential Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates (there are a couple of low-charting singles from the late '70s that have been left behind, but their absence isn't notable) and that the remastered sound is very good, making this an ideal compilation for fans looking for a thorough, career-spanning collection of hits. \n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2005\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Cover, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.She's Gone\n02.Las Vegas Turnaround (The Stewardess Song)\n03.When The Morning Comes\n04.Camellia\n05.Sara Smile\n06.Do What You Want, Be What You Are\n07.Rich Girl\n08.Back Together Again\n09.It's A Laugh\n10.I Don't Wanna Lose You\n11.Wait For Me\n12.How Does It Feel To Be Back\n13.You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling\n14.Kiss On My List\n15.You Make My Dreams\n16.Everytime You Go Away\n17.Private Eyes\n18.I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)\n19.Did It In A Minute\n20.Your Imagination\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.Maneater\n02.One On One\n03.Family Man\n04.Say It Isn't So\n05.Adult Education\n06.Out Of Touch\n07.Method Of Modern Love\n08.Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid\n09.Possession Obsession\n10.Everything Your Heart Desires\n11.Missed Opportunity\n12.Downtown Life\n13.So Close\n14.Don't Hold Back Your Love\n15.Starting All Over Again\n16.Promise Ain't Enough\n17.Do It For Love\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cdf8c54170d191a64e7a907226c93035c611b20","amp;dn":"The+Essential+Daryl+Hall+%26amp%3B+John+Oates+2005+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cdf8c54170d191a64e7a907226c93035c611b20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,223,140,84,23,13,25,26,100,231,169,7,34,108,147,3,92,97,27,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
