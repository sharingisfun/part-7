It provides derivations of the basic equations, the development of numerical schemes to solve them on computers and gives illustrations of application to typical systems.\r\nExtensive appendices are given to enable the reader to carry out computations to illustrate many of the points made in the main body of the book. \r\n\r\n* Starts from fundamental equations\r\n* Gives up-to-date illustration of the application of these techniques to typical systems of interest\r\n* Contains extensive appendices including derivations, equations to be used in practice and elementary computer codes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffc7c836caef601557e498ae5263e512d7f2c499","amp;dn":"The+Langevin+and+Generalised+Langevin+Approach+to+the+Dynamics+o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffc7c836caef601557e498ae5263e512d7f2c499","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,199,200,54,202,239,96,21,87,228,152,174,82,99,229,18,215,242,196,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
