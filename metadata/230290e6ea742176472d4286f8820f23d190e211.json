They were paired by record producer Scott Hendricks in 1991. Before the duo's foundation, both members of the duo were solo recording artists. Brooks wrote songs for John Conlee, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Highway 101 and released a solo album for Capitol Records; both he and Dunn also charted two solo singles apiece in the 1980s.\n\nSigned to Arista Records in 1991, the duo recorded ten studio albums, one Christmas album and three compilation albums for the label. They also released fifty singles, of which twenty went to number one on the Hot Country Songs charts and nineteen more reached top ten. Two of these number-one songs, &quot;My Maria&quot; (a cover of the B.W. Stevenson song) and &quot;Ain't Nothing 'Bout You&quot;, were the top country songs of 1996 and 2001, respectively, according to the Billboard Year-End charts. The latter is also the duo's longest-lasting number one, at six weeks. Several of their songs have also reached the Billboard Hot 100, where the duo's highest peaks are &quot;Ain't Nothing 'bout You&quot; and &quot;Red Dirt Road&quot;, both at number 25. Brooks &amp; Dunn also won the Country Music Association Vocal Duo of the Year award every year between 1992 and 2006, except for 2000. Two of Brooks &amp; Dunn's songs also won the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal: &quot;Hard Workin' Man&quot; in 1993 and &quot;My Maria&quot; in 1996. All but two of the duo's studio albums are certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Their highest-certified is their 1991 debut Brand New Man, which is certified sextuple-platinum for shipments of six million copies.\n\nThe duo announced their retirement in August 2009 and performed their final concert on September 2, 2010, at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee. Brooks has been the host of the radio show American Country Countdown since 2006, while Dunn will record a solo album for Arista. \n\n\n\n\n\n#1's...And Then Some 2009\n\n\n#1sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and Then Some is the title of a two-disc compilation album released on September 8, 2009 by country music duo Brooks &amp; Dunn. It is the duo's fifth greatest hits package and their last album together. The package contains two new tracks that were both released as singles, &quot;Indian Summer&quot; and a collaboration with ZZ Top lead guitarist Billy Gibbons, &quot;Honky Tonk Stomp&quot;, the latter of which is Brooks &amp; Dunn's 50th and final single as a duo.\n\n#1sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and Then Some is the final release from Brooks &amp; Dunn, who announced their 2010 retirement in August 2009.[1][5] The album reprises twenty-eight singles from the duo's previous studio albums, as well as the newly-recorded &quot;Indian Summer&quot; and &quot;Honky Tonk Stomp,&quot; the latter of which features ZZ Top lead singer Billy Gibbons. Both of these new songs have been released to radio as singles.\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Honky Tonk Stomp&quot; (Ronnie Dunn, Terry McBride, Bobby Pinson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01 \no\tfeat.
