Lee is nowhere to be found, and his allies are scattered across the state, each of them learning that their missions will not be as easy as they thought. Inside the walls of Camp Ryder, a silent war is brewing, between those few that still support Lee's vision of rebuilding, and the majority that support Jerry's desire for isolation. But this war will not remain silent for long. And in this savage world, everyone will have to make a choice.\n\nTo keep their morals. Or keep their lives.\n\nUnabridged.\n\n------------------------\nMore audiobooks:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://audiobookvault.ws&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://audiobookvault.ws&lt;/a&gt;\n-------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:562dc1c18e4bdea6a63f0a3c059f9d1e4bc2a1eb","amp;dn":"The+Remaining%3A+Fractured+-+DJ+Molles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"562dc1c18e4bdea6a63f0a3c059f9d1e4bc2a1eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,45,193,193,142,75,222,166,166,63,10,60,5,159,157,30,75,194,161,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
