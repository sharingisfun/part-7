A serious but artistic work, replete with facts, graphics and witness testimonials. The official story carefully deconstructed in front of our eyes.\n\n&quot;Excellent. The best of the 9/11 movies.&quot;\n--David Ray Griffin, author of The New Pearl Harbor\n\n&quot;WOW! is my reaction to this movie. Great insight into demolitions and what really happened on 9/11/2001.&quot;\n--Steven E. Jones, physics professor, Brigham Young University\n\n&quot;A superb work and asset to the patriot community and America itself.&quot;\n--Aaron Russo, producer/director, America: From Freedom to Fascism\n\n\nRun time: 90 minutes\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d88e3c0613bf86be72fa7924553e4bcf4a3e568","amp;dn":"911+MYSTERIES+PART+1+DEMOLITIONS+%5BDVD+-+USA+-+NTSC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d88e3c0613bf86be72fa7924553e4bcf4a3e568","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,136,227,192,97,59,248,107,231,47,167,146,69,83,228,188,244,163,229,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
