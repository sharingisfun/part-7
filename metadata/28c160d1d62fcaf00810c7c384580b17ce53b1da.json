They also teach many moves that lost their TM status, such as Dark Pulse, Roost and Stealth Rock. \n\nIf the player has used a Repel, after its effect wears off, and if the player has more Repels in their bag, they will be asked if they would like to use another immediately without having to go into the menu.\n\nA number of legendaries from Hoenn and Sinnoh (excluding the Weather trio and Creation trio) can be found in the post-game.\n\nZorua, Zoroark and TM95 (Snarl), which were previously accessible through Nintendo events only, can now be found within the game without any special requirements.\n\nThe Kami Trio are notably the only Unova regional PokÃƒÂ©mon absent from either game and must be obtained through the PokÃƒÂ©mon Dream Radar and then transferred or alternatively they can be traded from Black and White. \n\nThe Dream Radar is also necessary to obtain their new forms.\n\nBreeding was changedÃ¢â‚¬â€the Everstone now always passes down nature (if both parents hold Everstone, one parent's nature is randomly picked). \nFurthermore, offspring have an 80% chance to have the Ability slot corresponding to their mother, unless it is a Hidden Ability; for example, Venomoth with Shield Dust is more likely to breed Venonat with Compoundeyes than with Tinted Lens.\n\nAll PokÃƒÂ©mon Breeders can now be rebattled every time the player re-enters the area in which they are found. \n\n\nInstall Notes:\n++++++++++++++\n1.
