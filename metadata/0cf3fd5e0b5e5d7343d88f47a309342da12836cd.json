It has bolstered tyrants and helped depose them; contributed to conflict and created ceasefires. It has been an incubator of racism at home and helped bring down a racist regime abroad; shaped cities, changed cultures and inspired resistance. Its impact is as dynamic as the game itself. In this fascinating exploration, Jim Murphy takes us on a journey around the world and through the years, from FrancoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Spain to AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Alcatraz, Robben Island. Charting the match that sparked a Central American war, the Barcelona team threatened at gunpoint, and the game that helped save Rupert MurdochÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s media empire, among much else, Murphy lends a fresh new perspective to some of the most iconic moments in international football. Blending a love of the game with an appreciation of its place in global events, this is an authoritative and often humorous mix of sport and history, featuring fascinating first-hand insights from those most involved in the ten matches that changed the world Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and the one that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.\n\nReview\n\n&quot;It is a book about football and politics - it's not about England winning the World Cup in 1966. It is about social history.&quot; Sunday Express &quot; This is a really fascinating book.&quot; Kenny Dalglish In all my time as Prime Minister I was never in any doubt about the importance of football. Wherever I went, people wanted to talk about it. This book tells the stories of the links between football and some of the big world events.
