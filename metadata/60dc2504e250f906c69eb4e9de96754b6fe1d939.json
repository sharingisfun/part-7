The operating system is so full of industrial-strength routing protocols and IP innovations that those treading into the world of JUNOS will need clarification, explanation, and a showcase example or two. Look no further. This &quot;JUNOS Cookbook&quot; provides it all and more. Yes, you can mine through the 5,000 pages of documentation or take a two-thousand-dollar training course, but JUNOS&amp;#039;s interprocess sophistication can be baffling unless you know the shortcuts and tricks, as well as those rays of illuminating comprehension that can come only from those who live with it. &quot;JUNOS Cookbook&quot; is the first comprehensive book about JUNOS software and it provides over 200 time-saving step-by-step techniques including discussions about the processes and alternative ways to perform the same task. It&amp;#039;s been tested and tech-reviewed by field engineers who know how to take JUNOS out for a spin and it&amp;#039;s applicable to the entire line of M-, T-, and J-series routers. &quot;JUNOS Cookbook&quot; will not only pay for itself the first few times you use it, it will make your network easier to manage and update. &quot;Aviva Garrett has done a tremendous job of distilling the features of JUNOS software in a form that will be useful for a wide audience-students, field engineers, network architects, and other networking professionals alike will benefit from this book. For many people, this is the only book on JUNOS they will need.&quot; - Pradeep Sindhu, CTO and Founder, Juniper Networks. &quot;This cookbook is superb.
