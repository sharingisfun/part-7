Ayurveda is a holistic healing system developed in ancient India to increase an understanding of the human body, mind, and spirit. It organizes the elements of ether, air, fire, water, and earth into three body types, or doshas. Although each person is unique, one of these doshas will predominate their constitution and will need to be balanced on a regular basis.\nDairy products are important foods in traditional Ayurveda; however, for every milk-based food that Ayurvedic healers revere, there is an equally effective whole-food, vegan alternative. Following the same nutritional principles as traditional Ayurveda, Talya created over 120 delicious recipes that provide healing flavors and harmony to the mind and spirit. Easy-to-follow symbols on each recipe page show how the unique chemistry of that recipe can be used to balance the body'Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s constitution.\nSince a healthy digestive system is at the core of ayurvedic medicine, these recipes will keep you on track and in good health.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01d9d5f24fe9231f4ce5d65c3f89f6bfdc1991da","amp;dn":"The+Ayurvedic+Vegan+Kitchen%3A+Finding+Harmony+Through+Food","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01d9d5f24fe9231f4ce5d65c3f89f6bfdc1991da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,217,213,242,79,233,35,31,76,229,214,92,63,137,246,191,220,25,145,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
