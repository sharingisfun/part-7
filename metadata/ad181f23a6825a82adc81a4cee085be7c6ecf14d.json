It was the follow-up to the successful Moving Pictures. Stylistically, the album was a continuation of Rush's foray into the technology-oriented 1980s through increased use of electronic instrumentation such as keyboards, sequencers, and electric violin. Other noticeable changes were decreased average song length and lyrical compression. The album reached #10 on the Billboard album charts and was certified platinum (one million copies sold) by the RIAA in November 1982.\n\nTrack Listing [Remastered] [320k MP3]\n \t\n1. \t&quot;Subdivisions&quot;   \t5:34\n2. \t&quot;The Analog Kid&quot;   \t4:47\n3. \t&quot;Chemistry&quot; (Lee, Lifeson and Peart) \t4:56\n4. \t&quot;Digital Man&quot;   \t6:23\n5. \t&quot;The Weapon&quot; (Part II of Fear) \t6:27\n6. \t&quot;New World Man&quot;   \t3:44\n7. \t&quot;Losing It&quot;   \t4:53\n8. \t&quot;Countdown&quot;   \t5:48","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad181f23a6825a82adc81a4cee085be7c6ecf14d","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Signals+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad181f23a6825a82adc81a4cee085be7c6ecf14d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,24,31,35,166,130,90,130,173,200,26,76,238,8,91,231,198,236,241,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
