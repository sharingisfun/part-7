Detailed chapter openers offer strategies for using each rhetorical mode, including short examples from the readings within each chapter. Headnotes for each essay give a brief biography of its author, explain its context, and pinpoint one of the writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s techniques. Questions on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Organization and IdeasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Technique and StyleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and many suggestions for writing journal entries and essays follow each selection. Each chapter ends with additional writing assignments that ask the reader to compare two or more of the essays.\n\nGreat Resource for English Teachers February 22, 2012\nBy pinkcheetah\n\nThis book is a must-have for high school English teachers. Each style of writing (comparison/contrast; description; narrative; etc.) is broken down in easy-to-understand language, and the explanations are short enough that students will actually read it. The model essays are good (comparable to other collections); however, the description of each essay type is what sets this book above the others. I used it in my classroom with great success, and now as an English Instructional Coach who works with teachers in planning and implementing lessons, I recommend it often.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b56dd716ac64ea9bceb8986701eb6516c4ad6da0","amp;dn":"Elizabeth+Penfield+-+Short+Takes+11th+Ed.+%5BCollege+Writing%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b56dd716ac64ea9bceb8986701eb6516c4ad6da0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,109,215,22,172,100,234,155,206,184,152,103,1,235,101,22,196,173,109,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
