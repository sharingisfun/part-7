Once introduced by famed psychedelics advocate Timothy Leary as &quot;one of the most important people on the planet,&quot; radical philosopher Terence McKenna was an iconic legend in the psychedelic community. He died in 2000, but his ideas live on in the writings of author Dennis McKenna. On their Amazonian journey together, the brothers explored the outer limits of psychedelic experience and were haunted ever since by the curious events that overtook them in that primeval rainforest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ffdae0b1c9166cbc7b73581b5c9874e5599a198","amp;dn":"Dennis+McKenna+-+The+Brotherhood+of+the+Screaming+Abyss+%5BEpub+%26a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ffdae0b1c9166cbc7b73581b5c9874e5599a198","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,253,174,11,28,145,102,203,199,183,53,129,181,201,135,78,85,153,161,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
