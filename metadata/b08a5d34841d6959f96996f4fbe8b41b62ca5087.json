In a green valley, where the colliery is the unique economical activity, Huw (Roddy McDowall), his brothers and his sister are raised by his beloved parents, Mr. Gwilym Morgan Sr. (Donald Crisp) and Mrs. Beth Morgan (Sara Allgood). In times of changes and exploitations of the worker class, the young workers try to gather their power in a labor union and fight against the unemployed reserve army with a strike, while Mr. Morgan is against their movement. Along the years, the situation of the dwellers gets worse and worse, with poverty, while the coal mine blackens the hills of the valley with the slag.\n\nWhat a magnificent movie &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; is! This is the first time I see this movie, and I am really excited with such masterpiece. The outstanding and awesome direction of John Ford certainly deserved the Oscar he won in 1942. The story is excellent, with drama and romance in a period of economical and political changes in the world. There are many important and strong characters, built with heart by the cast, and I was particularly impressed with the touching performance of Roddy McDowall, in the role of a boy with strong personality and moral qualities. The awarded black and white cinematography is also remarkable. The wonderful metaphoric title completes this classic. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Como Era Verde Meu Vale&quot; (&quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b08a5d34841d6959f96996f4fbe8b41b62ca5087","amp;dn":"How+green+was+my+valley+-+1941","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b08a5d34841d6959f96996f4fbe8b41b62ca5087","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,138,93,52,132,29,105,89,249,105,150,244,251,232,180,27,98,202,80,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
