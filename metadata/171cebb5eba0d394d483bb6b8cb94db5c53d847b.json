Sharing a passion for all things Sicilian they make the perfect travel partners. Exploring the island through each other's eyes and hearts, they reveal how the layers of history have created a unique belnd of art and architecture. As well as the pleasures of an intense and vibrant culture, they experience the sadness the island has come through and the strength of the Sicilian people as they rose up and challenged the Mafia. Together they document how the various conquering forces and the rich variety of different heritages have helped to shape both the food and the culture of this beautiful Mediterranean island.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nIn the first episode, Andrew Graham-Dixon and Giorgio Locatelli take viewers on a journey into the heart of Sicily and introduce one another to the things they love about the island. Their first stop takes them to Giorgio's friend Vittorio and his restaurant near the seaside village of Porto Paolo. There is no menu, you are served whatever is best that day. It is Giorgio's favourite restaurant in the world. For him, the larger than life Vittorio represents the best of Sicily. Sicily may be less famous for art than its northern neighbours, but Andrew wants to change that. He takes Giorgio to see one of his favourite works of art in the capital Palermo, a typically Sicilian chapel hidden away down one of the city's many narrow streets. Created by the Palermitan sculptor Giacomo Serpotta, for Andrew it is a stunning example of the Sicilian approach to art and architecture. Plus the pair explores how, amongst the buzz and great beauty of the island, the shadowy presence of the mafia lurks around almost every corner.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/623/sicilyunpackedscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/623/sicilyunpackedscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/5323/sicilyunpackedscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/5323/sicilyunpackedscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img52.imageshack.us/img52/8204/sicilyunpackedscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img52.imageshack.us/img52/8204/sicilyunpackedscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4378/sicilyunpackedscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4378/sicilyunpackedscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3639/sicilyunpackedscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3639/sicilyunpackedscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/5389/sicilyunpackedscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/5389/sicilyunpackedscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/719/sicilyunpackedscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/719/sicilyunpackedscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/3900/sicilyunpackedscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/3900/sicilyunpackedscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/7296/sicilyunpackedscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/7296/sicilyunpackedscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1640 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:171cebb5eba0d394d483bb6b8cb94db5c53d847b","amp;dn":"BBC+Sicily+Unpacked+1of3+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"171cebb5eba0d394d483bb6b8cb94db5c53d847b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,28,235,181,235,160,211,148,212,131,187,107,140,185,77,181,197,61,132,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
