He took interest in many musical genres including jazz, rhythm and blues, and popular music. As a student pursuing music he turned down college scholarships in order to join the Lionel Hampton Band. During his time with Lionel Hampton he was able to write and arrange music and learn guitar. In 1952 Curtis decided to move to New York and became a session musician, recording for such labels as Prestige, Enjoy, Capitol, and Atco. He recorded with Nat Adderley and Wynton Kelly Buddy Holly and Andy Williams. \nStylistically, Curtis took inspiration from saxophonists Lester Young, Louis Jordan, Illinois Jacquet, Earl Bostic, and Gene Ammons. Known for his syncopated and percussive style, he was both versatile and powerful as a musician. He put together a group during his time as a session musician including Richard Tee, Cornell Dupree, Jerry Jemmott, and Bernard Purdie.\nKing Curtis enjoyed playing jazz and rock but decided he would make more money as a rock musician. From the 1950s until the mid 1960s, he worked as a session player, recording under his own name and with others such as the Coasters, with whom he recorded &quot;Yakety Yak.&quot; Buddy Holly hired him for session work, during which they recorded &quot;Reminiscing.&quot; Buddy wrote this song, but gave Curtis the songwriting credit for flying down to the session. His best-known singles from this period are &quot;Soul Twist&quot; and &quot;Soul Serenade.&quot;\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n   1.  Mess Around [02:40]\n   2. Chili        [02:08]\n   3.
