Rice originally stated the novel Blood Canticle was meant to conclude the series. However, in 2014, Rice herself revealed that an eleventh novel will be published in late 2014 and that it will be a sequel to the first five books.[3] She also announced via her personal Facebook that she has began writing a followup novel to Prince Lestat tentatively titled Blood Paradise.[4]\n\nWhen Rice was on her son Christopher Rice's radio program, &quot;The Dinner Party with Christopher Rice and Eric Shaw Quinn&quot;, she announced that her novel Prince Lestat could be considered a sequel to her novel The Queen of the Damned since many characters that appeared therein will reappear in Prince Lestat, while at the same time, readers might see a revisiting of key themes.[5]\n\nRiceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Vampire Chronicles have sold over 20 million copies in the U.S.[6]\n\nRice's first book in the Vampire Chronicles series, Interview with the Vampire (1976), featuring Lestat, was adapted into a movie and released in 1994, starring Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise.\nOverview\n\nWith the old queen of the vampires, Akasha, long dead, the Undead are in chaos all over the world. RiceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fabled Brat Prince, Lestat, is the only immortal known by name to all vampires young and old and many appeal to him to come out of his long exile and bring order as wanton destruction plagues revenants in city after city around the globe. With a return of some of RiceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most memorable characters, such as the melancholic Louis, the childlike Armand, the twins Maharet and Mekare, the former Talamasca scholar David Talbot, the ancient Romans Pandora and the noble Marius, and even Lestat's distant mother Gabrielle, the reader will meet many new vampires, all of whom must cooperate in guiding the vampire kinship with technology and ritual toward the path of unity, building a new vampire kingdom in the modern world.\nFilm adaptation\n\nUniversal Pictures acquired the motion picture rights to The Vampire Chronicles novels in August 2014. Producers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci will helm the potential film franchise.[7]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74b478b2a773e9b8f6b0051cfebaf409a1d0b58f","amp;dn":"Prince+Lestat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74b478b2a773e9b8f6b0051cfebaf409a1d0b58f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,180,120,178,167,115,233,184,246,176,5,28,254,186,244,9,161,208,181,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
