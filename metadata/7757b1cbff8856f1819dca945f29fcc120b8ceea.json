They are billeted in the home of the Fink family, where Albert and Paula Fink (Paula Schramm) form an immediate bond. Albert attends the local school, where teacher Elfie (Franka Potente) is having an affair with Walter (Lars Steinhofel), one of AlbertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s classmates and son of the local SS captain. When the village proves to be in the path of the advancing Americans, Albert and six classmates are pulled out of school and drafted into the German army. With no training and meagre weapons, the seven youths are ordered to defend a bridge to the death, keeping it open so that retreating soldiers can cross. Abandoned by their superior officers, and with the village inhabitants making their own plans, the teenagers believe they must do their duty for Germany. They remain at the bridge, awaiting the arrival of the America forces despite ElfieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s frantic efforts to make them see sense. Then, when the Americans arrive with tanks, all hell breaks loose. \n\nEnjoy your movie,\nDutch-Guy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7757b1cbff8856f1819dca945f29fcc120b8ceea","amp;dn":"The+Bridge.%28Die+Brucke%29.2008.DVDrip.Dutch%26amp%3BScandinavian+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7757b1cbff8856f1819dca945f29fcc120b8ceea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,87,177,203,255,136,86,241,129,157,202,148,95,41,252,193,32,184,206,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
