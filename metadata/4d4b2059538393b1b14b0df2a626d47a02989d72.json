Glad Tidings \n\n\nIn the history of popular music, there are works which, no matter how old they are, no matter how many times you have heard them, they remain consistently fresh, innovative, inviting and entertaining. Moondance, by Van Morrison, deserves an honored place on that list. The songwriting and the arrangements combine to form a mood and a feeling that is so distinct, so ephereal and relaxing, you feel like you are in another time and place. A special album, filled with special music.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 43\nArtist: Van Morrison\nAlbum: Moondance\nYear: 1970\nGenre: Folk/Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d4b2059538393b1b14b0df2a626d47a02989d72","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+-+Moondance+%5BFLAC-1970%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d4b2059538393b1b14b0df2a626d47a02989d72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,75,32,89,83,131,147,177,177,75,13,242,166,38,212,122,2,152,157,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
