HEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S the guy you want at your party. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get everyone dancing. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ll get everyone in your parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pool. Okay, so heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not exactly a shining academic star. He has no plans for college and will probably end up folding menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shirts for a living. But there are plenty of ladies in town, and with the help of Dean Martin and SeagramÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s V.O., lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty fabuloso, actually.\n\nUntil the morning he wakes up on a random front lawn, and he meets Aimee. AimeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clueless. Aimee is a social disaster. Aimee needs help, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to the Sutterman to show Aimee a splendiferous time and then let her go\nforth and prosper. But AimeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not like other girls, and before long heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in way over his head. For the first time in his life, he has the power to make a difference in someone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€or ruin it forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7878effaa984f8dcae5c8b9e136d837bad97b83","amp;dn":"The+Spectacular+now+by+Tim+Tharp+EPUB+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7878effaa984f8dcae5c8b9e136d837bad97b83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,135,142,255,170,152,79,141,202,229,200,185,225,54,216,55,186,217,123,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
