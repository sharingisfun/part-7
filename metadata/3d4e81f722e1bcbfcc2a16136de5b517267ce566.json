The first volume in the series was published by Puffin in 1982, with the rights to the series eventually being purchased by Wizard Books in 2002. The series distinguished itself by mixing Choose Your Own Adventure-style storytelling with a dice-based role-playing element, the caption on many of the covers claiming each title was an adventure â€œin which YOU are the hero!â€ The majority of the titles followed a fantasy theme, although science fiction, post-apocalyptic, superhero, and modern horror gamebooks were also published. The popularity of the series led to the creation of merchandise such as action figures, board games, role-playing game systems, magazines, novels, and video games","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d4e81f722e1bcbfcc2a16136de5b517267ce566","amp;dn":"Fighting+Fantasy+Collection+by+Steve+Jackson+and+Ian+Livingstone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d4e81f722e1bcbfcc2a16136de5b517267ce566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,78,129,247,34,225,188,191,204,42,22,19,109,229,181,23,38,124,229,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
