Nonetheless, considerable governance underlies the current order among states. In this study, nine leading international relations specialists examine the central features of this governance without government. They explore its ideational bases, behavioral patterns, and institutional arrangements as well as the pervasive changes presently at work within and among states. Within this context of change and order, the authors consider the role of the Concert of Europe, the pillars of the Westphalian system, the effectiveness of international institutions and regulatory mechanisms, the European Community and the micro-underpinnings of macro-governance practices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2b61ed8df7150539adac46873943349935f109c","amp;dn":"Governance+without+Government%3A+Order+and+Change+in+World+Politic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2b61ed8df7150539adac46873943349935f109c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,182,30,216,223,113,80,83,154,218,196,104,115,148,51,73,147,95,16,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
