Will these high school sweethearts play to their strengths and wow the judges or try too hard and fall flat? Hosted by Pete Evans and Manu Feildel.\n\nAnnie and Lloyd South Australia\nWe both love to come home and cook a beautiful meal and be creative. \nAnnie might wear the pants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or more likely slacks - in this relationship, but Lloyd is most definitely in charge in the kitchen.\n&quot;It's a good compromise,&quot; says medical student Lloyd.\nAdelaide high school sweethearts, Annie and Lloyd, both 23, play to their strengths when it comes to cooking Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which for Lloyd is flavour and technique and for Annie is presentation and organisation.\nFor fashion retailer Annie, everyone and everything should always look its best.\n&quot;I definitely have a very specific cutesy style and I mostly stick to wearing the colour pink. I only wear dresses and skirts. Occasionally I'll wear slacks but the more ladylike the better,&quot; she explains. &quot;I think everyone should always try to look their best.&quot;\nIt was Lloyd's impeccable styling which first grabbed her attention at a Sweet 16 birthday party and the pair have been inseparable ever since.\nBut this pair aren't your average 23 year olds.\n&quot;Homebody is the perfect word to describe us,&quot; says Lloyd. &quot;I get a bigger kick out of being the host than the guest. Usually when you invite people over to your house you want to give them a good experience, but really, selfishly, I'm kind of interested in doing it for me.&quot;\nLloyd says he has been at ease in the kitchen since he was a teenager.\n&quot;I think I had teenage growing pains... I actually needed four to five meals a day. I wasn't going to put that pressure on mum so I started doing stuff for myself. And eventually I started cooking stuff for Annie as well cause that's the popular way to woo a woman, bake her a cake and bring it over.&quot;\nAnnie was so impressed with his handmade sushi and pasta, that she booked in some lessons in the kitchen with her beau.\n&quot;We both love to come home and cook a beautiful meal and be creative. It's got to be fun; it can't just be your boring old dish,&quot; says Annie.\n&quot;We love salmon and potatoes. Lloyd's the salmon and I'm the potatoes. Lloyd's long and lean and I'm a little potato on the side. That's our signature dish. And a really great goey brownie just because it's naughty. So healthy and naughty.&quot;\nThey see their biggest strength in the competition as their relationship.\nSays Lloyd: &quot;You know we do have two different minds, but I can almost have a conversation in my head without Annie needing to say anything because I know what she would say to anything I would say. So I can like work it out without needing to have that verbal exchange and I think that speeds things up.&quot;\nAnd critiquing isn't something they'll find daunting either.\n&quot;We love saying that we're Sherlock and Watson,&quot; explains Annie, &quot;because we love looking at all the details and thinking how and why. We're very inquisitive like that.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e989de4e749568896d852a70f8b9473fcdac0bcf","amp;dn":"My.Kitchen.Rules.s06e05.WS.PDTV.x264.BF1.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e989de4e749568896d852a70f8b9473fcdac0bcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,137,222,78,116,149,104,137,109,133,42,112,248,185,71,63,205,172,11,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
