The possible impediments to a project's successful completion include not only bricks and mortar issues like material availability or curtain wall testing, but a broad array of concerns involving the economic, political, social, environmental, archeological, community, and historic preservation aspects of the project. Costly delays are common; regulatory processes can be prohibitive; stakeholders have more say. All of the people involved in an urban construction project must be knowledgeable about, and conversant with these conditions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f90dcfbd3b02fc7da4c814fc23b799b9a1d123f","amp;dn":"Construction+in+Cities%3A+Social%2C+Environmental%2C+Political%2C+and+Ec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f90dcfbd3b02fc7da4c814fc23b799b9a1d123f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,144,220,251,211,176,47,199,218,76,129,79,194,59,121,155,154,29,18,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
