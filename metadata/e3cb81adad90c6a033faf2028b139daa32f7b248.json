This is why we use VL for KMS\n activation.\n\n Then I added all the big MSP files into the updates folder.\n You can't simply toss the exe files from MS Download Center in the\n folder, but you can extract those files with 7-zip and then copy the\n en-US and the none.MSP files to there. You also have to add any\n proofing Spanish and French files or Update nags you.\n\n And that's exactly what I've done. These are all of the MSP files\n contained in MOST of the KB exe files available for download. There\n are still a few ones that don't have any MSP file inside, but\n they are very small. The non-MSP kb files total about 1-3megs on\n Microsoft Update. Those, you can do yourself. I cannot\n pre-integrate those without making a fully custom install using\n a bunch of registry settings, task settings, services, etc.\n Basically, just not gonna happen; would be a mistake to even try.\n\n MSP files added to Updates Folder:\n access-x-none.msp, ace-x-none.msp, convintl-en-us.msp,\n csi-x-none.msp, excel-x-none.msp, excelintl-en-us.msp,\n fpsrvutl-x-none.msp, groove-x-none.msp, grooveintl-en-us.msp,\n lync-x-none.msp, lyncintl-en-us.msp, msmipc-x-none.msp,\n mso-x-none.msp, msointl-en-us.msp, msores-x-none.msp,\n oart-x-none.msp, oleo-x-none.msp, onenote-x-none.msp,\n osetup-x-none.msp, outlfltr-x-none.msp, outlook-x-none.msp,\n outlookintl-en-us.msp, powerpoint-x-none.msp, powerpointintl-en-us.msp,\n project-x-none.msp, proof-en-us.msp, proof-es-es.msp,\n riched20-x-none.msp, visio-x-none.msp,\n visiointl-en-us.msp, vsto-x-none.msp, vviewer-x-none.msp,\n word-x-none.msp\n\n If you are contemplating using this for a different language, I'd\n recommend using the MSDN iso from that language, and going through the\n exe extraction process like I have. It's not difficult. You just keep\n extracting and adding them to the updates folder until Microsoft Update\n stops nagging you. Adding another language pack would probably be fairly\n simple, but I have no experience with that. You would need to search web.\n\n  Click the office button, then activation tab, etc.\n\n You can backup your activation files in MTK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3cb81adad90c6a033faf2028b139daa32f7b248","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Office+2013+professional+plus_x32x64+%2B+activator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3cb81adad90c6a033faf2028b139daa32f7b248","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,203,129,173,173,144,198,160,51,250,242,2,139,19,157,170,50,247,178,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
