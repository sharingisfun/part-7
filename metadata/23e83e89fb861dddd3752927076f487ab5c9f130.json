It's the word at the very\n center of the debate on Free Speech - and everyone seems to have\n an opinion. FUCK exams how the word is impacting our world today\n through interviews, film and television clips, music, and original\n animation by Bill Plympton. Scholars and linguists examine the long\n history of fuck. Comedians, actors, and writers who have charted and\n popularized the upward course of fuck are heard from, often while\n defending the Constitutional Right of Free Speech, all the way to\n the Supreme Court. FUCK visits with those who actually fuck for a\n living. We hear from advocates who oppose fuck and its infringement\n into our everyday lives. We watch some of the most famous and\n infamous film and television clips that feature fuck, we hear some\n of the most famous fucks ever uttered and we'll feel the impact of\n fuck on our everyday lives.\n\n\n\n\n[ ]\n\n Zardos says: Enjoy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ ]\n\nThoughts are rushing trough your mind, they just wont stop\nyou cant concentrate, you cant plan your life, life is\njust miserable, you get nothing done properly...\n\nHeads up, there is a solution..
