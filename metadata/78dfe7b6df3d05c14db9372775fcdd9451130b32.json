The film was directed by Ron Howard, from a screenplay written by Akiva Goldsman. It was inspired by a bestselling, Pulitzer Prize-nominated 1998 book of the same name by Sylvia Nasar. The film stars Russell Crowe, along with Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany and Christopher Plummer in supporting roles. The story begins in the early years of a young prodigy named John Nash. Early in the film, Nash begins developing paranoid schizophrenia and endures delusional episodes while painfully watching the loss and burden his condition brings on his wife and friends.\nThe film opened in the United States cinemas on December 21, 2001. It went to gross over $313 million worldwide and to win four Academy Awards, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress. It was also nominated for Best Actor, Best Film Editing, Best Makeup, and Best Original Score.\nIt was well received by critics, but has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of some aspects of Nash's life, especially his other family and a son born out of wedlock.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nObsesionado con la bÃƒÂºsqueda de una idea matemÃƒÂ¡tica verdaderamente original, el brillante estudiante John Forbes Nash (Russell Crowe) llega a Princeton en 1947 para realizar sus estudios de postgrado. Es un muchacho extraÃƒÂ±o y solitario, al que sÃƒÂ³lo comprende su compaÃƒÂ±ero de cuarto (Paul Bettany). Por fin, Nash esboza una revolucionaria teorÃƒÂ­a y consigue una plaza de profesor en el MIT. Alicia LardÃƒÂ© (Jennifer Connelly), una de sus alumnas, lo deja fascinado al mostrarle que las leyes del amor estÃƒÂ¡n por encima de las de las matemÃƒÂ¡ticas. Gracias a su prodigiosa habilidad para descifrar cÃƒÂ³digos es reclutado por Parcher William (Ed Harris), del departamento de Defensa, para ayudar a los EE.UU. en la Guerra FrÃƒÂ­a contra la UniÃƒÂ³n SoviÃƒÂ©tica.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78dfe7b6df3d05c14db9372775fcdd9451130b32","amp;dn":"A+Beautiful+Mind+-+%28English+%2F+Spanish+Subtitles%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78dfe7b6df3d05c14db9372775fcdd9451130b32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,223,231,182,223,61,5,193,77,185,55,39,117,252,221,148,81,19,11,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
