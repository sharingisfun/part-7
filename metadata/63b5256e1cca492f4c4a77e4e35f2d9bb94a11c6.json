SmitherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talent as a fingerstyle guitarist has always been impressive, but it seems that with age heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s developing a richer, hearty vocal tone that adds an extra depth. The sparse percussion of ex-Morphine drummer Billy Conway is the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unsung hero, so unobtrusive but vital in the way it pushes the tunes forward. Producer David Goodrich has crammed quite a lot into Hundred Dollar Valentine while still making it sound utterly intimate, which is no mean feat.\n\nThe guitar that powers What They Say might seem a little too close to SmitherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2006 tune Leave The Light On, but the rest of the song Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all perky vocals, howling harp and down home fiddle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ensures itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best cuts. All We Need To Know is bleak and ominous, while Make Room For Me that follows might have a similarly dark subject matter but comes across more carefree; you can just see SmitherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wry smile as he speaks of the world destructing and the human race being consigned to cages.\n\nSmither is highly adept at acoustic blues with subject matter that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t follow any tropes of the genre; thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always a little grit and a little cheek. On Hundred Dollar Valentine heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only being his own sardonic, humourous self and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a damn good fit.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63b5256e1cca492f4c4a77e4e35f2d9bb94a11c6","amp;dn":"Chris+Smither+-+Hundred+Dollar+Valentine+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63b5256e1cca492f4c4a77e4e35f2d9bb94a11c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,181,37,110,28,202,73,47,76,74,119,228,227,95,45,155,185,74,17,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
