With his commercially savvy fusion of post-Merle Haggard country, honky tonk, post-folk-rock sensitive singer/songwriter sensibilities, and '70s arena rock dramatics, Brooks brought country music to a new audience in the '90s -- namely, a mass audience. Before Brooks, it was inconceivable for a country artist to go multi-platinum. He shattered that barrier in 1991, when his second album, No Fences, began its chart domination, and its follow-up, Ropin' the Wind, became the first country album to debut at the top of the pop charts; No Fences would eventually sell a record-shattering 13 million copies. After Garth, country music had successfully carved a permanent place for itself on the pop charts. In the process, it lost a lot of the traditionalism that had always been its hallmark, but that is precisely why Brooks is important.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/garth-brooks-p1535/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/garth-brooks-p1535/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):\n\nThe Chase is Garth Brooks' most ambitious and personal album. Not coincidentally, it is one of his least popular releases, selling about half of what the previous Ropin' the Wind had. But in its own way, The Chase is more rewarding and deeper than Ropin' the Wind. That's partially due to Brooks' naked ambition; not only does he record &quot;We Shall Be Free&quot; with a gospel choir, but he tackles deeper social and personal issues than he has before. However, the true key to the album is Brooks' conviction; even when his musical experiments don't quite work, it's easy to admire and respect his ambition. Although there are light moments like &quot;Night Rider's Lament&quot; and a cover of Little Feat's &quot;Dixie Chicken,&quot; The Chase is a more somber, reflective record than his previous three albums; but given a bit of a time, it's as satisfying as anything he's ever recorded.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-chase-r710384&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-chase-r710384&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002V15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002V15&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
