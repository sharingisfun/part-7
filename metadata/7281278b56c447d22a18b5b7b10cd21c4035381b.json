Why did the Bolsheviks come to power rather than some other party? How did StalinÃ¢â‚¬â€rather than a more popular and respected leaderÃ¢â‚¬â€win the mantle of Lenin and gain leadership of the ruling party? How should Stalin's regime be judged by subsequent generations of Russians, and in the context of world history?\n\nIn Russian Revolution, 1917-1945, author Anthony D'Agostino discusses all these questions. His suggestions for further reading range over decades of writing on Soviet subjects and cite classics, revisionist works, curiosities, and studies done during and since the Gorbachev years. The book explores topics including the modernization of the Tsarist Russian state, World War I, the revolutionary project of Soviet Communism, the nationalist transformation of Soviet Communism under international pressures, the &quot;Big Drive&quot; to modernize Russia by force, and the external threat of fascism","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7281278b56c447d22a18b5b7b10cd21c4035381b","amp;dn":"The+Russian+Revolution%2C+1917-1945","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7281278b56c447d22a18b5b7b10cd21c4035381b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,129,39,139,86,196,71,210,42,24,181,183,177,12,210,28,64,53,56,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
