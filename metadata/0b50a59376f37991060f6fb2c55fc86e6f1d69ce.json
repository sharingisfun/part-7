Was America's easy victory proof of its military superiority, or were the Afghans merely eyeing the newcomers as they have watched foreign armies in centuries past, knowing time is on their side.\nFor over 2,500 years, the forbidding territory of Afghanistan has served as a vital crossroads - not just for armies but for clashes between civilizations--the Greeks, Arabs, Mongols, and Tartars, and in more recent times, Britain and Russia.\n\nTitle: Afghanistan: A Military History From Alexander The Great To The Fall Of The Taliban\nAuthor: Stephen Tanner\nPublisher: Da Capo Press\nYear: 2009\nFormat: PDF\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
