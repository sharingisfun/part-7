Thompson\n\nPlot Outline (taken from Wikipedia):\n\nSiddhartha is an allegorical novel by Hermann Hesse which deals with the spiritual journey of an Indian man called Siddhartha during the time of the Buddha.\n\nThe book, Hesse&amp;#039;s ninth novel, was written in German, in a simple, yet powerful and lyrical style. It was first published in 1922, after Hesse had spent some time in India in the 1910s. It was published in the U.S. in 1951 and became influential during the 1960s.\n\nThe novel takes place in ancient India around the time of the Buddha (6th century BC). It starts as Siddhartha, a Ksatriya&amp;#039;s son, leaves his home to join the ascetics with his companion Govinda. The two set out in the search of enlightenment. Siddhartha goes through a series of changes and realizations as he attempts to achieve this goal.\n\n\nPlease seed 1:1\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0831430aea84b28b196f447422592e58b54a822f","amp;dn":"Hermann+Hesse+-+Siddhartha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0831430aea84b28b196f447422592e58b54a822f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,49,67,10,234,132,178,139,25,111,68,116,34,89,46,88,181,74,130,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
