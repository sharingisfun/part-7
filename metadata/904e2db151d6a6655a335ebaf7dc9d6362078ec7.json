In the first round, they encounter a very troublesome, bloody protein and a can of chips that's more than meets the eye. The three chefs who move on to the second round are in for something gooey and gory Ã¢â‚¬â€ and something that is just offal. The final two chefs boldly move on to a devilishly difficult dessert round.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 06-Oct-2013\n\n\n\n\nEpisode notes: All baskets have ingredients with a Halloween theme.\n\nThis episode originally aired prior to Halloween Wars.\n\nAlso, Food Network lists this episode as part of Season 16 hence the numbering discrepancy.
