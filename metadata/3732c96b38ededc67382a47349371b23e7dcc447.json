ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a great deal more structure in their work than is found in many of their contemporaries, and their contemplative song structures work in favor to this approach. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the perennial box of chocolates filled with razor wire, but even the most fastidious of modern music archaeologists wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t see this one coming. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/02/25/no-joy/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3732c96b38ededc67382a47349371b23e7dcc447","amp;dn":"No+Joy...Ghost+Blonde%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3732c96b38ededc67382a47349371b23e7dcc447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,50,201,107,56,237,237,198,115,130,164,115,73,55,27,35,231,220,196,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
