Yet many of these achievements were made possible only by ItalyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proximity to the Islamic world. The Arts of Fire shows just how important Islamic influences were on one particular facet of the Italian Renaissance: the development of Italian luxury ceramics and glass. \n\nThe Arts of Fire demonstrates how many of the techniques of glass and ceramic production and ornamentation were first developed in the Islamic East between the eighth and twelfth centuries. Essays by volume editor Catherine Hess and by Linda Komaroff and George Saliba demonstrate early modern EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debt to the Islamic world and help us better understand the interrelationships of cultures over time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e53490376b59e7059d3a8a99d40bd4ed3369f433","amp;dn":"The+Arts+of+Fire+-+Islamic+Influences+on+Glass+and+Ceramics+of+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e53490376b59e7059d3a8a99d40bd4ed3369f433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,52,144,55,107,89,231,5,157,58,138,153,212,11,212,237,51,105,244,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
