Video is on par with the average cam,\nand audio is a little above average. The audio is a little bit quiet, so turn up\nyour volume. Be aware that the film has a lot of funky colors in it, so any\nunrealistic colors you see, aren't just related to this rip.\nThere are a few minutes where the video goes black throughout when the camera had to\nbe hidden from ushers. Also, unfortunately due to technical issues the video from the\nlast 15 minutes is not available. The audio is still there, though. We'd suggest you\neither listen the ending, or maybe even watch it theaters. We would also be\nappreciative of any individual or group who would go into the theater to CAM the last\n15 minutes, and would be happy to do a rerender from our master with the additional\nminutes added back in.\n\nIMDB Info:\n\nName: Spring Breakers\nGenre: Comedy | Crime | Drama\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2101441/\nIMDB Rating: 6.5/10 from 10,640 users\nDirector: Harmony Korine\nWriter: Harmony Korine\nCast: Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson\nPlot: Four college girls who land in jail after robbing a restaurant in order to fund\ntheir spring break vacation find themselves bailed out by a drug and arms dealer who\nwants them to do some dirty work.\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/23101911237660246501.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/23101911237660246501.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/65705178957613149407.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/65705178957613149407.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/12773928077740224949.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/12773928077740224949.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0c5836a853bf653dc4a79a0d086826805245a5b","amp;dn":"Spring.Breakers.2013.READNFO.x264-AMiGOS.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0c5836a853bf653dc4a79a0d086826805245a5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,197,131,106,133,59,246,83,220,74,121,160,208,134,130,104,5,36,90,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
