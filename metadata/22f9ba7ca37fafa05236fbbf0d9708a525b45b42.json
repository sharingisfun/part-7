A consciously literary work -- the songs even bear titles like &quot;Child's Christmas in Wales,&quot; &quot;Macbeth,&quot; and &quot;Graham Greene&quot; -- Paris 1919 is close in spirit to a collection of short stories; the songs are richly poetic, enigmatic period pieces strongly evocative of their time and place. Chris Thomas' production is appropriately lush and sweeping, with many tracks set to orchestral accompaniment; indeed, there's little here to suggest either Cale's noisy, abrasive past or the chaos about to resurface in his subsequent work -- for better or worse, his music never achieved a similar beauty again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22f9ba7ca37fafa05236fbbf0d9708a525b45b42","amp;dn":"John+Cale+-+Paris+1919+%5B1973%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22f9ba7ca37fafa05236fbbf0d9708a525b45b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,249,186,124,163,127,175,160,82,54,251,191,13,151,8,165,37,180,91,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
