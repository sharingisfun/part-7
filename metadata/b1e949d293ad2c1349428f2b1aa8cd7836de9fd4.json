Prized as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the best stone in BritainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Roman invaders who carved jewelry out of it, coal has transformed societies, expanded frontiers, and sparked social movements, and still powers our electric grid. Yet coalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world-changing power has come at a tremendous price, including centuries of blackening our skies and lungsÃ¢â‚¬â€and now the dangerous warming of our global climate. Ranging from the Ã¢â‚¬Å“great stinking fogsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of London to the rat-infested coal mines of Pennsylvania, from the impoverished slums of Manchester to the toxic streets of Beijing, Coal is a captivating narrative about an ordinary substance with an extraordinary impact on human civilization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1e949d293ad2c1349428f2b1aa8cd7836de9fd4","amp;dn":"Coal%3A+A+Human+History+By+Barbara+Freese%5Baudio+book%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1e949d293ad2c1349428f2b1aa8cd7836de9fd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,233,73,210,147,173,44,19,73,66,143,43,26,168,205,120,54,222,159,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
