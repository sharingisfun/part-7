As many comics fans know, the series chronicles the adventures of the Bone cousins--plucky Fone Bone, scheming Phony Bone, and easygoing Smiley Bone-- who leave their home of Boneville and are swept up in a Tolkienesque epic of royalty, dragons, and unspeakable evil forces out to conquer humankind. The compilation makes it evident how fully formed Smith's vision was from the very beginning--although the early chapters emphasized comedy, as do the final pages, the tale quickly found its dramatic bearings. His remarkably accomplished drawing style, in the manner of such comics masters as Walt Kelly and Carl Barks, was fully formed from the start, too. Libraries that have missed out on individual Bone series titles should seize this opportunity to make up for the fact, and those who have collected the series all along will do well to acquire the collected edition to supplement or supplant those doubtless well-worn volumes. But be prepared for overdues: even the most voracious readers will be hard-pressed to get through this hefty, phone book-like tome before they're supposed to return it.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Bone-Complete-Cartoon-Epic-One/dp/188896314X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Bone-Complete-Cartoon-Epic-One/dp/188896314X&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.boneville.com/2006/06/27/bone-one-volume-available-again/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.boneville.com/2006/06/27/bone-one-volume-available-again/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.graphicnovelreporter.com/content/bone-one-volume-edition-review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.graphicnovelreporter.com/content/bone-one-volume-edition-review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContains:\n\nBone - One Volume Edition (2004 (phaze-DCP).cbz 295 MB\n\nTorrent downloaded from46 B ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d517ad931d1e9cd25e09444f24003df7df6dcba1","amp;dn":"Bone%3A+The+Complete+Cartoon+Epic+in+One+Volume","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d517ad931d1e9cd25e09444f24003df7df6dcba1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,23,173,147,29,30,156,210,94,9,68,79,36,0,61,247,223,109,203,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
