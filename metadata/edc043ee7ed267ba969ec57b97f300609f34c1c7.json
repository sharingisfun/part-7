EJ Hassenfratz leads this project-based learning experience, which relies on C4D's inverse kinematics (IK) tools. First, you'll prepare the model hierarchy for animation, before adding joints and applying an IK tag that transforms your joint system into an IK chain. Then you'll animate the entire rig and use constraints tags and Xpresso data to control all the moving parts in the arm. Last, EJ shows you how to render the project and import it into After Effects for further refinement.\n\nTopics include:\nSetting up the model\nCreating an IK chain\nAdding animation controls\nConstraining position, scale, and rotation\nAdding depth of field and motion blur in After Effects","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edc043ee7ed267ba969ec57b97f300609f34c1c7","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Mograph+Techniques+Rigging+a+Robot+Arm+in+CINEMA+4D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edc043ee7ed267ba969ec57b97f300609f34c1c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,192,67,238,126,210,103,186,150,158,197,123,151,243,0,96,159,52,193,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
