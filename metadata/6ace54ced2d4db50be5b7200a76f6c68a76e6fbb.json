Until a group of fanatical sleeper-cell shock troops launch an all-out assault to &quot;liberate&quot; their jailed comrades. There's just one problem: they don't know that Army Ranger Lucas Kincaid is working at Hell's Gate.\n\nWith the town's high school team held hostage and in danger of being executed one by one, Kincaid assembles a ragtag band of survivors and aging hardcore cons into a lethal fighting force to keep the unholy warriors from their deadly mission. And Kincaid and his men are on their own--everyone, from the President on down, orders Kincaid to give in to the terrorists' demands.\n\nBut warrior Lucas Kincaid, out-numbered and out-gunned, won't back down.\n\nOne thing's for sure: when the enemy gets to Hell, they'll know America sent them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ace54ced2d4db50be5b7200a76f6c68a76e6fbb","amp;dn":"William+W+and+J+A+Johnstone+-+Stand+Your+Ground+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ace54ced2d4db50be5b7200a76f6c68a76e6fbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,206,84,206,210,212,219,80,190,91,114,0,167,111,108,104,167,110,111,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
