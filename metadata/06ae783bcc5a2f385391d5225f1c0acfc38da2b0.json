Karl becomes the protector of Randall's daughter Anya when their lives are threatened by whoever is behind the recent string of carjackings, and the plot behind the carjackings runs a lot deeper than the Brotherhood, and the threat is a lot closer to Karl and Anya than they dare to think.\n\nRipped with Autogk\n\nLength: 1 Hour 30 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 608\n\nFrame Height: 352\n\nFrame Rate: 30fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 114kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06ae783bcc5a2f385391d5225f1c0acfc38da2b0","amp;dn":"The+Substitute+2%3ASchool%5C%27s+Out%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06ae783bcc5a2f385391d5225f1c0acfc38da2b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,174,120,59,204,90,47,56,83,145,213,34,95,28,10,207,195,141,162,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
