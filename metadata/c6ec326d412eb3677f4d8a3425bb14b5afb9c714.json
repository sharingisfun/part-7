It is expected to be released on April 12, 2011 through Metal Blade Records. The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues is the first release in a two-part conceptual album suite and is the first release by the band since their signing to Metal Blade.\nBetween the Buried and Me made the conscious decision to preclude a studio album with an extended play for several reasons. In addition to being part of a concept album series, frontman Tommy Giles Rogers also listed wanting to keep the group's name &quot;out there&quot; and seeking new material to perform at concerts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6ec326d412eb3677f4d8a3425bb14b5afb9c714","amp;dn":"Between+The+Buried+and+Me+-+The+Parallax%3A+Hypersleep+Dialogues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6ec326d412eb3677f4d8a3425bb14b5afb9c714","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,236,50,109,65,46,179,103,127,77,138,52,37,187,20,181,175,185,199,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
