Everywhere At Once is more polished than their other releases (the Zero Hour EP, The Plimsouls, and singles), and includes their biggest hit, &quot;A Million Miles Away.&quot;\n\nI bought this on vinyl originally, but bought the CD when it was released in that format.  This is ripped from that CD, in 320k VBR MP3 format.\n\nIf you're a Plimsouls fan, you'll dig this, their only major release album.  I've got the rest of the Plimsouls discography as well, so comment if you'd like to see more.\n\nThanks.  Share and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:486d70ae46753231078279ceb1bf83233b156ac0","amp;dn":"The+Plimsouls+-+Everywhere+At+Once+%5B1983%2C+320k+VBR+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"486d70ae46753231078279ceb1bf83233b156ac0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,109,112,174,70,117,50,49,7,130,121,206,177,191,131,35,59,21,106,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
