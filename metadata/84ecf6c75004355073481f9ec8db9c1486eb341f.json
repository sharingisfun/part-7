Take the lead of a small feudal army and try to defend your right to survive in this ruthless medieval world.\r\nThe mysterious lands of old Germany are waiting for you - it's a land where the superstitions of the time have come to life. This isnâ€™t a fantasy game. There are no elves or dragons here. There are only people - and their passions, sins and fears that often take a tangible form. Which path will you choose? Live according to your conscience? Or live by power and might? Or will you live by justice? And what is your justice, really?\r\nA unique and dynamic combat system - each move is also an attack\r\nThe ability to individually equip *each* fighter in your army\r\nAn intriguing non-linear story\r\nA distinctive game world without common fantasy cliches\r\nOver 50 hours of gameplay within the game.
