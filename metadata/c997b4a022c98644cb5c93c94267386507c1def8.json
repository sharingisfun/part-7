Alexander RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶der - The Secret Formula\n\nTracks present (according to track list on the cover images) in 2-disk Anno 2070 OST set, but absent in all rips of that 2-disk set that are available for download:\nCD1 - Eco:\n09. God Smiles (by Tilman Sillescu)\n14. Inside The Womb (by Alexander RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶der)\n22. Perfect Order (by Markus Schmidt)\n25. Release (presumably by Tilman Sillescu)\n29. Rest Your Head (by Alexander RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶der)\n31. Surely Dr. Devi Knows (by Tilman Sillescu)\nCD2 - Tycoon:\n02. Anybody Need Anything? (by Markus Schmidt)\n10. Dominion (by Markus Schmidt)\n32. The Final Hour\n37. God Smiles (English vocals) (by Tilman Sillescu)\nAll of these tracks, except for &quot;The Final Hour&quot; are included in this torrent.\n\nTrack &quot;The Final Hour&quot; (CD2 - Tycoon, track number 32) is not in the game. On the other hand, a track named &quot;The Secret Formula&quot; is (that track is not mentioned anywhere). It is unknown whether these two titles are different names for the same track or not.\nTrack &quot;Tumbling Raindrops&quot; (CD1 - Eco, track number 32) is not in the game, however in all available rips of the 2-disk set the tracks &quot;Our Borrowed Time&quot; and &quot;Tumbling Raindrops&quot; are identical. This torrent includes only a track named &quot;Our Borrowed Time&quot;\n\nThings to note:\n* Anno 2070 stored all music tracks encoded in mp3. This torrent provides them in that format exactly, without re-encoding.\n* Names of the files ripped from the game are left intact.\n* Some of the mp3 files in the game had id3v2.2.0 tags. These were preserved, albeit converted to id3v2.4.0.\n* &quot;Asymmetric Warfare&quot;, &quot;Collateral Damage&quot;, &quot;Drone Predators&quot; and &quot;Civilian Casualties&quot; are split into parts. They were stored like that in the game.\n* &quot;Drone Predators (loop)&quot; cuts off abruptly at the end. It was like that in the game.\n* The sound skips at the start of &quot;Grinding Teeth&quot;. It was like that in the game, and it is like that in the CDrip version. This is not a glitch.\n* All track numbers are set according to the complete (and the longest) track list on CD covers, which means that there are gaps in numbering, since some tracks are missing. &quot;The Secret Formula&quot; was given a track number 39 and put into CD2, because it sounds tycoony.\n* Artist names for &quot;Release&quot; and &quot;The Secret Formula&quot; were guessed (&quot;Release&quot; follows the same theme as &quot;Project Earth&quot;, and thus probably authored by Tilman Sillescu; the guessing process for &quot;The Secret Formula&quot; was much less scientific).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c997b4a022c98644cb5c93c94267386507c1def8","amp;dn":"Anno+2070+Soundtrack+%282011%29+%28mp3%2C+gamerip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c997b4a022c98644cb5c93c94267386507c1def8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,151,180,160,34,201,134,68,203,92,147,201,66,103,56,101,7,193,222,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
