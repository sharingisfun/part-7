Just this once, be the bad guy!\nOverview:\nBeing the Dungeon Keeper and all, this is your home, too. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your business to take these loathsome creatures of darkness and hone them into screaming, frothing, clawing forces of destruction. You lure them in with food and the promise of dank and fetid places to sleep. You keep them in line with the back of your hand and the threat of dire consequences. You pit their scaly hides against the best that the Forces of Good can muster, and they die for you as they rip steaming entrails out of the hapless heroes.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a degenerate and nasty jobÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ And you love it. Yes, home its where you heart is. In a box. Packed in salt. That's right--Dungeon Keeper, Bullfrog's classic dungeon management strategy, gives you no extra credit for having any morals. After all, the underworld isn't black and white!\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nGOTHIC 1, 2, 3\nIN COLD BLOOD\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nJourneyman Project 3\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac1fe68fdc10e5e1ba660267cca362378286ca41","amp;dn":"Dungeon+Keeper+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac1fe68fdc10e5e1ba660267cca362378286ca41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,31,230,143,220,16,229,225,186,102,2,103,204,163,98,55,130,134,202,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
