How Renaissance Artists and Reformation Priests Created Our World by Thomas Cahill\nNan A. Talese | 2013 | ISBN: 0385495579 | 368 pages | EPUB | 22 MB\n\nFrom the inimitable bestselling author Thomas Cahill, another popular historyÃ¢â‚¬â€this one focusing on how the innovations of the Renaissance and the Reformation changed the Western world. A truly revolutionary book.\n\nIn Volume VI of his acclaimed Hinges of History series, Thomas Cahill guides us through the thrilling period of the Renaissance and the Reformation (the late fourteenth to the early seventeenth century), so full of innovation and cultural change that the Western world would not experience its like again until the twentieth century. Beginning with the continent-wide disaster of the Black Death, Cahill traces the many developments in European thought and experience that served both the new humanism of the Renaissance and the seemingly abrupt religious alterations of the increasingly radical Reformation. This is an age of the most sublime artistic and scientific adventure, but also of newly powerful princes and armies and of newly found courage, as many thousands refuse to bow their heads to the religious pieties of the past. It is an era of just-discovered continents and previously unknown peoples. More than anything, it is a time of individuality in which a whole culture must achieve a new balance if the West is to continue.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c83232aae37ccd52f7f705598ab4bf9a444d67fd","amp;dn":"Heretics+and+Heroes+-+How+Renaissance+Artists+and+Reformation+Pr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c83232aae37ccd52f7f705598ab4bf9a444d67fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,50,50,170,227,124,205,82,247,247,5,89,138,180,191,154,68,77,103,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
