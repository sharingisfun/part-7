You are an American pilot, Captain Lewis Stone, who is thrown into a prison camp of the Nazis. While attempting to escape the camp, Captain Stone discovers about a secret weapon the Germans are developing to use against the Allies. Soon his personal wish of escape turns into a desire to save the world from the destruction the Nazis are planning.\n\n&quot;Prisoner of War&quot; could be best described as a sneaking game. Unlike other well-known games which feature the sneaking element - such as &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; or &quot;Deus Ex&quot; - &quot;Prisoner of War&quot; is based on it entirely. You are helpless in the prison camp and your only weapon is your wit. Sneak past guards to deliver an important object to a fellow prisoner, hide items in your clothes, stay in shadows to avoid being recognized - this is what the game is about. It also has a good deal of puzzle-solving, like in a traditional adventure.\n\n\nExtract Archive With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\nThen Mount Image Or Burn To CD\n\nInstall The Game And Play\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e48a799972f572e831f6081dc36c69ffd71b86c2","amp;dn":"World.War.II.Prisoner.Of.War.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e48a799972f572e831f6081dc36c69ffd71b86c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,138,121,153,114,245,114,232,49,246,8,29,195,108,105,255,215,27,134,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
