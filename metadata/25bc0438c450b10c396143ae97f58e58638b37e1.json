Thermal designers of shell-and-tube heat exchangers (STHE) will find the book indispensable for understanding the mechanics of thermal-hydraulics in STHEs and thereby for utilizing commercially available software packages to produce optimum designs. The book explains the interplay of parameters. By understanding the behaviour of STHEs, process engineers will find this book essential for better harnessing and specifying STHEs. The book will be vital for operating plant engineers. Students and teachers of undergraduate and graduate courses in unfired vessel heat transfer will find this book essential for an understanding of practical design of industrial STHEs. The book has been written in pragmatic and easy to understand language","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25bc0438c450b10c396143ae97f58e58638b37e1","amp;dn":"Practical+Thermal+Design+of+Shell-and-Tube+Heat+Exchangers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25bc0438c450b10c396143ae97f58e58638b37e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,188,4,56,196,80,177,12,57,97,67,174,151,245,142,88,99,139,55,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
