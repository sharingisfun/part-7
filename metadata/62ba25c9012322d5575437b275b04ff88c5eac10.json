But since the rest of the series was ripped too, I figured I might as well add that too.\nThe best way was to just up the new digital rips from WARPs website (where you can read it for free, so go support them). But since Wavedancers and some extras is not on the WARP site, this was not enough!\n\nSo I found out I had an OLD collection of everything Elfquest related that was scanned, that include all the comics in all formats, the RPG, some parodies, a music CD, EVERYTHING! Those are of course of a lower quality, but along with the digitals they will give you as complete a collection as you will ever get.\n\nAs a bonus, I also included the newly released Complete Elfquest, which is in black and white (I prefer the colour version myself), and the released issues of the new series, The Final Quest, which is still ongoing.\n\n\n\nElfquest follows Cutter, the leader of a tribe of forest-dwelling elves known as Wolfriders. Burned out of their home by humans and tricked into the desert by trolls, the Wolfriders discover another tribe of elves, the Sunfolk. They settle down with the Sunfolk for several years, but the return of their old enemy, the humans, leads Cutter to wonder if there are other tribes of elves out beyond the desert. He decides to go on a quest to search for these possible tribes, and his journey will change the lives of not only his tribe but all those he meets.\n\nThis story has a huge cast of characters that includes four different elf tribes, two troll tribes, and various humans tribes, but the main protagonist is Cutter. He is young, having only been chief for a handful of years, but he takes his responsibilities seriously. Protecting his tribe, both elf and wolf, is important to him. He would put himself in harmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way before any of the tribe. He is handy with a sword, as his name implies, and can be hotheaded at times, but he does try to think before he acts. He is helped in this by his best friend and brother in all but blood Skywise, and his lifemate Leetah, the cool-headed healer of the Sunfolk.\n\nElfquest is a fantasy adventure. The elves are magical creatures who use telepathy called sending to speak with one another and who never utter falsehoods. They can use different kinds of magic, including shaping plants and rocks, and healers can shape flesh and fight to defy death itself. Elves are immortal, slowly aging, but they can still die of wounds, hunger or the elements. Trolls, sort of rivals to the elves, do not have any innate magic of their own. They are diggers, living underground and digging up minerals and smithing tools, weapons, and jewelry. They are a greedy lot, even to the point of trying to deny the elves their birthright. Preservers are pixie-like beings who are small and tough, with butterfly-like wings, and are fiercely loyal to the elves. They spit out a webbing they call wrapstuff that preserves anything they wrap in it.\n\nWhile there is plenty of fantasy with the characters, the story is filled with just as much adventure and drama. It opens with the Wolfriders rescuing one of their own from being sacrificed from humans. Then they are running from a fire started by those same humans and struggling through a barren desert, all just in the first two chapters. Even when they find safety, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no rest for them as Cutter becomes tangled up in a ritual duel for the right to court Leetah with the SunfolkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chief hunter Rayek. The series keeps a fairly brisk pace, even in its slower moments.\n\nThe characters are well developed and continue to grow throughout the series. They grow and learn from their mistakes and follies. Nothing is included in the story that will distract from its overarching plot. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one of the great things about Elfquest: It is tightly plotted and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wander off even if the reader wants it to go back and explore something else. The story sticks to its path and comes to a satisfying end while keeping the door open to further adventures.\n\n\n\n\nThe Complete Elfquest: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/elzRZqvq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/elzRZqvq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/CbC2zSkT.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/CbC2zSkT.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/gWyttSKB.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/gWyttSKB.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/u1vknTqe.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/u1vknTqe.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nElfquest, digital version &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/mb5fS98E.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/mb5fS98E.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/BbL5rKX6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/BbL5rKX6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/XsjGTYcy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/XsjGTYcy.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/JOH1IaZ5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/JOH1IaZ5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/LmNqwBER.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/LmNqwBER.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/lF99cJ3g.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/lF99cJ3g.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/8UcGIiW6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/8UcGIiW6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/DJlKkWor.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/DJlKkWor.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nElfquest, old scans &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/X5qj1gfG.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/X5qj1gfG.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/ti2XEEwJ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/ti2XEEwJ.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/P38vwok6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/P38vwok6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/a9CEmxWh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/a9CEmxWh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/wIOGz0wq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/wIOGz0wq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/ExNxX413.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/ExNxX413.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/POOy5SGR.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/POOy5SGR.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/QEGEJhgC.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/QEGEJhgC.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62ba25c9012322d5575437b275b04ff88c5eac10","amp;dn":"ElfQuest+megapack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62ba25c9012322d5575437b275b04ff88c5eac10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,186,37,201,1,35,34,213,87,84,55,178,117,176,79,248,140,94,172,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
