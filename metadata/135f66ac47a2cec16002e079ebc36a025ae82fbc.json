Those are probably his recordings from the early 50's, so even with such fine mp3 quality (ahem), sound is not exactly what we would expect from a rip of like bitrate of a modern recording. With that in mind, it is still great music with decent, or at least, acceptable sound quality, so\n\n\nEnjoy : )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:135f66ac47a2cec16002e079ebc36a025ae82fbc","amp;dn":"Beethoven+-+The+9+Symphonies+-+Furtwangler+-+mp3+%28320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"135f66ac47a2cec16002e079ebc36a025ae82fbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,95,102,172,71,162,206,193,96,2,224,121,235,195,106,2,90,232,47,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
