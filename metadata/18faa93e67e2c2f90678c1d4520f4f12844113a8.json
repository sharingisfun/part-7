Recorded by her father, who also helps perform on many tracks along with other friends and family members, the disc showcases Alela Diane's knack for gentle, immediate melodies and her fine voice, possessed of a hint of twang that suggests a combination of Dusty Springfield and Kristin Hersh, with a rich maturity beyond her years.\n\n1.
