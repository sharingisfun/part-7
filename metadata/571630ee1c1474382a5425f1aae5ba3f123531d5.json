Da-avi-id Wilcock!!! \n[Applause]\n\n[Onto the stage steps legendary PirateBay\nfan/uploader/seeder 'InformationShouldBeFree']\nWow, what an introduction!\nNow of course I'm not David Wilcock, \nbut I do have his latest stuff! [applause]\n\nThere are two reasons I'm sharing this with you today. \nFirst, as you all know I believe information should be free. \nSecond, most of this latest release is just research \nthat has been stolen from various scientists and researchers, \nand presented as the work of Mr. Wilcock. \nNow I don't see why he should make money off other \npeople's work, so that's why I'm sharing this \nwith everybody.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's not good research; it's actually not bad. \nI was listening to William Henry's show Revelations \n(Hypesters, Lies and Mind Control 1-11-12) \na few weeks ago, and he was pissed!! He said, \nnot only did Wilcock steal his material and present it as his own, \nbut he deliberately distorted many facts. Henry said, \n...it was so bad, that HE HAD TO KNOW! [that he was distorting it!] \nHenry's guest, Randy Maugans discussed Wilcocks \n&quot;nervous breakdown&quot; about a &quot;meaningless, \ntrillion-dollar lawsuit&quot; in Dec. He went on to say that \nradio host James Martinez calls Wilcock a &quot;publicity \nseeker and a hoaxer&quot;.  Maugans explicitly stated about \nWilcocks latest work &quot;THERE IS NOTHING NEW \nin this book!&quot; So save your money, and decide for yourself \nabout the validity of this book, and what all this fuss is about.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:571630ee1c1474382a5425f1aae5ba3f123531d5","amp;dn":"David+Wilcock+-+The+Source+Field+Investigations%2C+MP3+and+ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"571630ee1c1474382a5425f1aae5ba3f123531d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,22,48,238,28,20,116,56,42,84,37,241,170,229,186,63,18,53,49,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
