She has won numerous awards and her achievements in the rock music genre have earned her the title &quot;The Queen of Rock 'n' Roll&quot;.[1][2][3] Turner started out her music career with husband Ike Turner as a member of the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue.[4] Success followed with a string of hits including &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; and the 1971 hit &quot;Proud Mary&quot;. With the publication of her autobiography I, Tina, came allegations of spousal abuse against Ike Turner following their 1977 split. Turner rebuilt her career, launching a string of hits beginning in 1983 with &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot; and the 1984 release of her album Private Dancer.\n\nHer musical career led to film roles, beginning with a prominent role as The Acid Queen in the 1975 film Tommy, and an appearance in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. She starred opposite Mel Gibson as Aunty Entity in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome for which she received the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture, and her version of the film's theme, &quot;We Don't Need Another Hero&quot;, was a hit single. She appeared in the 1993 film Last Action Hero.\n\nOne of the world's most popular entertainers, Turner has been called the most successful female rock artist[5] and was named &quot;one of the greatest singers of all time&quot; by Rolling Stone.[6] Her records have sold nearly 200 million copies worldwide.[7][8] She has sold more concert tickets than any other solo music performer in history.[9][10] She is known for her energetic stage presence,[2] powerful vocals, career longevity,[9] and widespread appeal.[11] In 2008, Turner left semi-retirement to embark on her Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour.[12][13] Turner's tour has become one of the highest selling ticketed shows of 2008-2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply the Best 1991\n\n\nSimply the Best is the name of Tina Turner's 1991 &quot;best of&quot; compilation album of her most popular hits since her comeback in the early-mid 1980s. It also included three new songs; Love Thing (UK Airplay #13), I Want You Near Me (#22 UK), and Way of the World (UK Airplay #6 and UK #13) as well as a re-recorded dance version of Turner's classic &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot;, all of which were also issued as singles in 1991 and 1992. The album is Turner's biggest seller in the UK where it is one of the best selling albums of all time for sales in excess of 2.4 million copies[1]. It was certified 8x platinum in the UK and stayed on the UK charts for over 140 weeks. The album sold 7 million copies worldwide[2].\n\nThe compilation was released with a different track listing in the U.S. with the songs &quot;Addicted To Love (Live)&quot; and &quot;Be Tender With Me Baby&quot; being replaced by &quot;What You Get Is What You See&quot; and &quot;Look Me in the Heart&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;The Best&quot; (7&quot; Edit) (Chapman, Knight) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n2.\t&quot;Better Be Good to Me&quot; (7&quot; Edit) (Chapman, Chinn, Knight) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n3.\t&quot;I Can't Stand the Rain&quot; (Bryant, Miller, Peebles) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n4.\t&quot;What's Love Got to Do with It&quot; (Britten, Lyle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n5.\t&quot;I Don't Wanna Lose You&quot; (Hammond, Lyle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n6.\t&quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot; (The 90's Version) (Turner) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n7.\t&quot;What You Get Is What You See&quot; (Britten, Lyle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28 \no\tFrom 1986 album Break Every Rule\n8.\t&quot;Let's Stay Together&quot; (7&quot; Edit) (Green, Jackson, Mitchell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n9.\t&quot;Steamy Windows&quot; (White) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n10.\t&quot;Typical Male&quot; (Britten, Lyle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n11.\t&quot;We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)&quot; (7&quot; Edit) (Britten, Lyle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n12.\t&quot;Private Dancer&quot; (7&quot; Edit) (Knopfler) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n13.\t&quot;Look Me in the Heart&quot; (Kelly, Steinberg) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41 \no\tFrom 1989 album Foreign Affair\n14.\t&quot;It Takes Two&quot; (duet with Rod Stewart) (Moy, Stevenson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n15.\t&quot;I Want You Near Me&quot; (Britten, Lyle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n16.\t&quot;Way of the World&quot; (Hammond, Lyle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n17.\t&quot;Love Thing&quot; (Hammond, Knight) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f40fcbc444dfc538fa9d5be87bf940c69e3c9a03","amp;dn":"Tina+Turner+-+Simply+the+Best+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f40fcbc444dfc538fa9d5be87bf940c69e3c9a03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,15,203,196,68,223,197,56,250,157,91,232,123,249,64,198,158,60,154,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
