First published in 1961, they were an instant hit, going from the original two per month up to the current eight a month in a very few years. At first only Second World War stories were featured but this has widened as the years have passed and readers have asked for other backgrounds for their stories [/quote]\n\nUPLOADER NOTE\n\nTwo things if you download some of the Commando comics i put up already there are also in this pack, it was easier for me to compile the torrent rather brake up this torrent into lots of little torrents. Yet to make up for that i given one MEGA PACK of Commando comics this is all i can find on the net there are no more apart from the new ones as and when they are released (with five new issues in this torrent)\n\nFULL credit goes to both Empire and a guy called Graham (latest issues) and unknown scanners who have made this pack possble\n\nKeep Reading \nZinc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df359b927bc59d092eb110581b6b087fcc1926c5","amp;dn":"Commando+-+%5BCOMIC+MEGA+PACK%5D%5BZINC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df359b927bc59d092eb110581b6b087fcc1926c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,53,155,146,123,197,157,9,46,177,16,88,27,107,8,127,204,25,38,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
