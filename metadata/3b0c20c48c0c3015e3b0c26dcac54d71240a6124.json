Although the noble samurai of the Emerald Empire were victorious, the conflict was devastating beyond all others, and the lands of the Great Clans were left in ruins by the fighting. To spare her people the threat of further war, war which would surely lead to the death of an Empire, the Divine Empress sued for peace with the forces of darkness, and then dispatched her vassals to claim the empty lands left behind in the wake of the Destroyers.\n\nA generation later, the untimely death of a prominent magistrate in Rokugan suddenly elevates a group of simple samurai to a position of authority, but the magistrateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unfinished business sends them to the Second City to see it to completion. There, influential samurai from the Empire have almost limitless potential, but the distractions from duty are numerous.\n\nIn the Second City, will honor prove stronger than steel?\n\nThis release includes: \n\nSecond City - The People.pdf\nSecond City - Journal Pillow Book.pdf\nSecond City - Journal Yogo Tanaka.pdf\nSecond City - Map Printing.pdf\nSecond City - Map.pdf\nSecond City - The Campaign.pdf\nSecond City - The City.pdf\n\n\nPS: Support the companies, which games you actually enjoy :)\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b0c20c48c0c3015e3b0c26dcac54d71240a6124","amp;dn":"Legend+of+the+Five+Rings+4th+Ed+-+Second+City+Boxed+Set","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b0c20c48c0c3015e3b0c26dcac54d71240a6124","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,12,32,196,140,12,48,21,227,176,194,109,202,197,77,113,36,10,97,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
