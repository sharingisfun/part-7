The story first appeared in 13th-century chronicles,[1] and was subsequently spread and embellished throughout Europe. It was widely believed for centuries, though modern religious scholars consider it fictitious, perhaps deriving from historicized folklore regarding Roman monuments or from anti-papal satire.\n\nThe first mention of the female pope appears in the chronicle of Jean de Mailly, but the most popular and influential version was that interpolated into Martin of Opava's Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum, later in the 13th century. Most versions of her story describe her as a talented and learned woman who disguises herself as a man, often at the behest of a lover. In the most common accounts, due to her abilities, she rises through the church hierarchy, eventually being elected pope; however, while riding on horseback, she gives birth, thus exposing her sex. In most versions, she dies shortly after, either being killed by an angry mob or from natural causes. Her memory is then shunned by her successors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62d268ac0ba3efca9f163e5c219f363fe5aa5349","amp;dn":"Pope+Joan+2009+%28GR+SUBS%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62d268ac0ba3efca9f163e5c219f363fe5aa5349","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,210,104,172,11,163,239,202,159,22,62,92,33,159,54,63,229,170,83,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
