Masvidal gave a following statement for the Irish magazine Molten:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ \tIt's almost like, I don't know how to explain it, but if I had to put it in a box it's more sci-fi, futuristic and alien but at the same time very song-driven. It's kind of like, to me, coming into CYNIC's body more. It feels very modern and at the same time it just feels really cool. I'm big in the space. It's definitely new. It's not like anything we've done before. It's a new color, a new space. I think people will really take note of even the guitar stuff. I'm really shifting gears, I'm trying things in a different way and the way stuff is played. It's a new space for CYNIC, for sure. It definitely sounds like us, except completely new. \tÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n  \t\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Paul Masvidal\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ \t&quot;It's a bold new sound for Cynic and marks a gigantic leap in the band's progression. We've had a lot of time to let this material develop and gestate, and it finally feels ready to be unleashed on the world. I've been in trio mode with Malone and Masvidal flushing out a zillion and one details, and couldn't be happier about what's happening with these songs. They are truly alive!&quot; \tÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n  \t\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Sean Reinert\n\n\n\nThe album was made available for streaming on the 6th of February, 2014. \nTrack Listing\nNo. \tTitle \tMusic \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;True Hallucination Speak&quot;   \tMasvidal, Reinert, Malone \t6:03\n2. \t&quot;The Lion's Roar&quot;   \tMasvidal, Reinert, Malone \t4:34\n3. \t&quot;Kindly Bent to Free Us&quot;   \tMasvidal, Reinert, Malone \t6:27\n4. \t&quot;Infinite Shapes&quot;   \tMasvidal, Reinert, Malone \t4:57\n5. \t&quot;Moon Heart Sun Head&quot;   \tMasvidal, Reinert, Malone \t5:21\n6. \t&quot;Gitanjali&quot;   \tMasvidal, Reinert, Malone \t3:58\n7. \t&quot;Holy Fallout&quot;   \tMasvidal, Reinert, Malone \t6:35\n8. \t&quot;Endlessly Bountiful&quot;   \tMasvidal, Reinert, Malone \t3:56\n9. \t&quot;Earth Is My Witness (deluxe CD book exclusive bonus track)&quot;   \tMasvidal, Reinert, Malone \t4:32\nTotal length:\n\t41:51 \t\nPersonnel\nLineup\n\n    Paul Masvidal - Vocals, Guitars, Keys\n    Sean Malone - Fretless bass, Chapman stick\n    Sean Reinert - Drums\nGet if you want ,seed if you get..............","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:721f20315804318c9f7ccd8b444034b1317bf5ef","amp;dn":"Cynic+-+Kindly+Bent+To+Free+Us+%28Deluxe+Edition%29++mp3+320k+a2k201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"721f20315804318c9f7ccd8b444034b1317bf5ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,31,32,49,88,4,49,140,159,124,205,139,68,64,52,177,49,123,245,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
