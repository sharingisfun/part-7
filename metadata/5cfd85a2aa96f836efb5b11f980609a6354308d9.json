ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a crucial first step in the exploration of the solar system, and Bradley and his team are on the cutting edge.\n\nBut U.S. president Kenneth PhoenixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plans to militarize and industrialize EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s orbit sparks an arms race in space that eclipses the darkest and most terrifying days of the Cold War. Before he can prevent it, Bradley and his team are caught at the center of a battle that threatens to become an all-out global conflict for control of space.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cfd85a2aa96f836efb5b11f980609a6354308d9","amp;dn":"Dale+Brown+-+Starfire+%28Retail%29+%28Request%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cfd85a2aa96f836efb5b11f980609a6354308d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,253,133,162,170,150,248,54,239,181,177,31,152,6,9,166,53,67,8,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
