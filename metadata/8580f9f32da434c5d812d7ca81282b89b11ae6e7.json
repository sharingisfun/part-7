The album was recorded at RAK Studios in London during most of 2002, and was produced by Gil Norton.  The band returned to live performance after Lee's suicide, playing low-key slots at various festivals in the United Kingdom, before releasing the single &quot;Come Back Around&quot; and then the album. Three further singlesÃ¢â‚¬â€&quot;Just the Way I'm Feeling&quot;, &quot;Forget About Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Find the Colour&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€followed the album's release. The album received positive reviews from the music press and was received well by the public, reaching number six on the UK Albums Chart. Although charting one place lower than predecessor Echo Park, Comfort in Sound had a much stronger chart run of 36 weeks on the weekly top 75 album chart, in comparison to the nine weeks of Echo Park.  Comfort in Sound is seen as a major commercial success, selling 503,706 units in the United Kingdom and giving the band their second top ten single, &quot;Just the Way I'm Feeling&quot;.\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Just The Way I'm Feeling\n[02] Come Back Around\n[03] Helium\n[04] Child In You\n[05] Comfort In Sound\n[06] Forget About Tomorrow\n[07] Summer's Gone\n[08] Godzilla\n[09] Quick Fade\n[10] Find The Colour\n[11] Love Pollution\n[12] Moonshine\n\nPlay Time - 00h:48m:11s\n\n*** - Music Videos Can Be Found On My FLAC Torrent (uploading straight after this one)\n\n\nTotal File Size....................... 118mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
