Shirer.\n\n\n# Publisher: Rosetta Books (2014)\n# ISBN: 9780795342462\n\n\nThe Bismark was the greatest warship ever built, with guns so powerful and\n\naccurate it could destroy an enemy ship while safely staying outside the line of\n\nfire. But the Allies had to sink it -- or risk losing the war. William Shirer,\n\nfamed World War II correspondent and author of The Rise and Fall of the Third\n\nReich, captures every suspenseful moment of the perilous mission. Most tragic of\n\nall was the loss of the HMS Hood, the British NavyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s star battleship, sunk by\n\nthe Bismark in just minutes. However, a mixture of luck and new technology --\n\nincluding radar -- turned the tide in the AlliesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ favor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b50eed1d9924e5acf0bd859c5d23a9fa7816204f","amp;dn":"The+Sinking+of+the+Bismarck+-+William+L.+Shirer+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b50eed1d9924e5acf0bd859c5d23a9fa7816204f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,14,237,29,153,36,229,172,240,189,133,156,93,35,169,250,120,22,32,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
