All this audio left almost no room for any video, so, apart from the immersive audio, this is a very basic dvd.\n\n* &quot;Surrounded is a box set released on June 27, 2006, featuring seven of BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk's albums in DualDisc format (http://unit.bjork.com/specials/surrounded/). The seven-disc box set contains the original albums on the CD sides, and the DVD sides contain each album remastered in Dolby Digital and DTS 96/24 5.1 surround sound. The corresponding music videos are also featured on the discs and are in PCM 2.0, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1. The original stereo mixes are used for the CD sides and are not remastered.&quot;\n\n* &quot;Volta was released in three editions in the UK: a digipak CD edition; a limited edition CD/DVD edition (featuring surround audio in DTS); and a double vinyl edition.&quot;\n\nThe surround mixing on these albums has really been done extremely well. Many surround mixes (from Metallica and Depeche Mode for instance), have had the same mistake they made in the 60's, when the first stereo mixes became popular, by doing some extreme panning to show off the 'novelty' of the extra channel(s). Very fun at first, but very distracting when you want to start listening to the music again, instead of your s(urr)ound system.\n\nWhat the extra channels can help create for the music though, is a wider sound stage and less 'muddy', more distinct sounds overall, and that's exactly what's happening on these albums: a very wide, immersive soundstage and perfectly prioritized mixing, with lots of detail. If you know the stereo mixes, you will be able to totally rediscover the albums with these great 5.1 mixes!\n\nInterview with BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk about the album Drawing Restraint 9: For now, most of us can only enjoy the stereo mix of DR9 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the 5.1 mixes will be available in mid-2006. &quot;It's kind of sad to have to do that,&quot; BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk admits, &quot;but at the same time, if you only make records for people with 5.1 systems, you would just be making music for rich people!&quot; She laughs. &quot;And that's something I don't want to do.&quot;\n\nThis one's for the poor people. If you enjoy this, and can afford the real deal with all the extra's: please buy it.\n\nDebut\n01__________________Human Behaviour\n02__________________Crying\n03__________________Venus as a Boy\n04__________________There's More to Life Than This\n05__________________Like Someone in Love\n06__________________Big Time Sensuality\n07__________________One Day\n08__________________Aeroplane\n09__________________Come to Me\n10__________________Violently Happy\n11__________________The Anchor Song\n12__________________Play Dead\n\nPost\n01__________________Army of Me\n02__________________Hyper-Ballad\n03__________________The Modern Things\n04__________________It's Oh So Quiet\n05__________________Enjoy\n06__________________You've Been Flirting Again\n07__________________Isobel\n08__________________Possibly Maybe\n09__________________I Miss You\n10__________________Cover Me\n11__________________Headphones\n\nHomogenic\n01__________________Hunter\n02__________________JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ga\n03__________________Unravel\n04__________________Bachelorette\n05__________________All Neon Like\n06__________________5 Years\n07__________________Immature\n08__________________Alarm Call\n09__________________Pluto\n10__________________All Is Full of Love\n\nSelmasongs\n01__________________Overture\n02__________________Cvalda\n03__________________I've Seen It All\n04__________________Scatterheart\n05__________________In the Musicals\n06__________________107 Steps\n07__________________New World\n\nVespertine\n01__________________Hidden Place\n02__________________Cocoon\n03__________________It's Not Up to You\n04__________________Undo\n05__________________Pagan Poetry\n06__________________Frosti\n07__________________Aurora\n08__________________An Echo, a Stain\n09__________________Sun in My Mouth\n10__________________Heirloom\n11__________________Harm of Will\n12__________________Unison\n\nMedulla\n01__________________Pleasure Is All Mine\n02__________________Show Me Forgiveness\n03__________________Where Is the Line\n04__________________VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶kurÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³\n05__________________ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œll Birtan\n06__________________Who Is It\n07__________________Submarine\n08__________________Desired Constellation\n09__________________Oceania\n10__________________Sonnets/Unrealities XI\n11__________________Ancestors\n12__________________Mouth's Cradle\n13__________________Midvikudags\n14__________________Triumph of a Heart\n\nDrawing Restraint 9\n01__________________Gratitude\n02__________________Petrolatum\n03__________________Pearl\n04__________________Bath\n05__________________Hunter Vessel\n06__________________Shimenawa\n07__________________Vessel Shimenawa\n08__________________Storm\n09__________________Holographic Entrypoint\n10__________________Ambergris March\n11__________________Cetacea\n12__________________Antarctic Return\n\nVolta\n01__________________Earth Intruders\n02__________________Wanderlust\n03__________________Dull Flame of Desire\n04__________________Innocence\n05__________________I See Who You Are\n06__________________Vertebrae by Vertebrae\n07__________________Pneumonia\n08__________________Hope\n09__________________Declare Independence\n10__________________My Juvenile\n\n\nPlease open up your upload speeds while downloading, and keep this seeded to 150% to help speed things up for everyone...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8821fab6f360bceb3492f25da1681150e4c152d7","amp;dn":"Bj%C3%83%C2%B6rk+Discography+-+All+8+Studio+Albums+in+DTS+5.1+on+1+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8821fab6f360bceb3492f25da1681150e4c152d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,33,250,182,243,96,188,235,52,146,242,93,161,104,17,80,228,193,82,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
