The key component for building a sound is the instrumentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 8 oscillators, 2 filters and up to 32 envelopes. These components are all it needs to create anything from classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“old schoolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ FM timbres to complex sounds far beyond those possible with conventional FM synthesis.\nThe Octopus' 2 Filters permit using the filters as modulation sources; thus they can be used to modulate an oscillatorÃ¢â‚¬â€the sonic possibilities are tremendous.\n\n\n\n\n   \n   Flexible, Matrix-based Frequency Modulation synthesis\n   Oscillator Matrix with 10 modulation sources and\n     8 modulation destinations\n   550 presets sounds in a wide range of styles made by\n     Nico Herz, Summa, Tim Conrardy and others\n   full cross-modulation, adjustable feedback for every\n     oscillator\n   8 additive oscillators using sample-based or\n     user defined waveforms\n   Two independent multimode filters,\n     available as FM sources\n   Up to 32 envelopes with multiple, syncable segments,\n     freerun, loop and adjustable slopes\n   Graphical envelope editor with sophisticated\n    editing functions\n   Envelopes can be used to modulate a wide range of\n    parameters including amplitude, mix, panning, pitch,\n    frequency, phase, cutoff and resonance of filters\n   Stereo effects section with 4 effects (Parametric EQ,\n    Chorus, Delay and Reverb)\n   Two step sequencers each with up to 32 steps each\n   24 voice polyphonic\n\n\n\n\n  PC computer with at least 700 MHz CPU\n  VST capable host software (DAW), like Cubase,\n  FL Studio etc\n  SaxLab itself requires about 40 Mb memory\n  (first instance, 30 Mb for all additional\n  instances)\n  a Screen resolution of 1024 x 768 or better\n  Windows XP and newer, any Processor\n  Octopus comes as both native 32 bit and 64 bit\n  plugin\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  You need WinRar or other extractor of your choise to extract the rar file\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Install\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  For the VST copy patched dll x86 or x64 to your VST folder, normally at:\n  C:Program FilesVstPlugins\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ click on the reg file for serial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
