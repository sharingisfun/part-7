Bartle (Author), Donald R. Sherbert (Author)\n\nThis text provides the fundamental concepts and techniques of real analysis for students in all of these areas. It helps one develop the ability to think deductively, analyze mathematical situations, and extend ideas to a new context. Like the first three editions, this edition maintains the same spirit and user-friendly approach with additional examples and expansion on Logical Operations and Set Theory. There is also content revision in the following areas: Introducing point-set topology before discussing continuity, including a more thorough discussion of limsup and limimf, covering series directly following sequences, adding coverage of Lebesgue Integral and the construction of the reals, and drawing student attention to possible applications wherever possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:657c2e1ffa8c19e2787de87bd4c7060168b746cc","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Real+Analysis%2C+4th+Edition+-+Bartle+%26amp%3B+Sherbe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"657c2e1ffa8c19e2787de87bd4c7060168b746cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,124,46,31,250,140,25,226,120,125,232,123,212,199,6,1,104,183,70,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
