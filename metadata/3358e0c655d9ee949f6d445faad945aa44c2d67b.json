Gill (Author)\n\nA guide to the techniques used in perspective drawing covers basic optical and atmospheric effect, shade and shadow, light reflection and absorption, contrast, texture, and style.\n\nThis is a book about the mechanics of drawing, not the feeling and expression of it. It is an excellent instructional text, absolutely full of illustrations. It's impressing by the clear logical explanation of how light operates in the atmosphere. Reading it allowed you to control depth in the drawings to a far greater degree than you ever thought you could achieve. This book could give almost any artist, no matter what their style or subject matter, a better insight into how we actually see the world. If you ever need to draw anything at all, read this book \n\nISBN-10: 050027634X\nISBN-13: 978-0500276341","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3358e0c655d9ee949f6d445faad945aa44c2d67b","amp;dn":"Robert+W.+Gill+-+1991+-+Basic+Rendering+-+Effective+drawing+for+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3358e0c655d9ee949f6d445faad945aa44c2d67b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,88,224,198,85,217,238,148,159,109,68,95,170,217,69,170,68,194,214,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
