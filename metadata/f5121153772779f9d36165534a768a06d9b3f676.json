There are more than 290 million copies of his books in print, and they have been translated into 32 languages. Ludlum also published books under the pseudonyms Jonathan Ryder and Michael Shepherd.\n\nSome of Ludlum's novels have been made into films and mini-series, including The Osterman Weekend, The Holcroft Covenant, The Apocalypse Watch, The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum. A non-Ludlum book supposedly inspired by his unused notes, Covert One: The Hades Factor, has also been made into a mini-series. The Bourne movies, starring Matt Damon in the title role, have been commercially and critically successful (The Bourne Ultimatum won three Academy Awards in 2008), although the story lines depart significantly from the source material.\n\nLudlum died in 2001 of a subdural hematoma.\n\nJason Bourne:\n1. The Bourne Identity (1980): Who is Jason Bourne? Is he an assassin, a terrorist, a thief? Why has he got four million dollars in a Swiss bank account? Why has someone tried to murder him?...\n\nJason Bourne does not know the answer to any of these questions. Suffering from amnesia, he does not even know that he is Jason Bourne. What manner of man is he? What are his secrets? Who has he killed?\n\n2. The Bourne Supremacy (1986): Reenter the shadowy world of Jason Bourne, an expert assassin still plagued by the splintered nightmares of his former life. This time the stakes are higher than ever. For someone else has taken on the Bourne identityÃ¢â‚¬â€a ruthless killer who must be stopped or the world will pay a devastating price. To succeed, the real Jason Bourne must maneuver through the dangerous labyrinth of international espionageÃ¢â‚¬â€an exotic world filled with CIA plots, turncoat agents, and ever-shifting alliancesÃ¢â‚¬â€all the while hoping to find the truth behind his haunted memories and the answers to his own fragmented past. This time there are two BournesÃ¢â‚¬â€and one must die.\n\n3. The Bourne Ultimatum (1990): At a small-town carnival, two men, each mysteriously summoned by telegram, witness a bizarre killing. The telegrams are signed Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jason Bourne.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Only they know BourneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true identity and understand that the telegrams are really a message from BourneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mortal enemy, Carlos, known also as the Jackal, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deadliest and most elusive terrorist. And furthermore, they know what the Jackal wants: a final confrontation with Bourne. Now David Webb, professor of Oriental studies, husband, and father, must do what he hoped never to do againÃ¢â‚¬â€assume the terrible identity of Jason Bourne. His plan is simple: to infiltrate the politically and economically omnipotent Medusan group and use himself as bait to lure the cunning Jackal into a deadly trapÃ¢â‚¬â€a trap from which only one of them will escape.\n\nFull Retail. ePub, Mobi, AZW3.
