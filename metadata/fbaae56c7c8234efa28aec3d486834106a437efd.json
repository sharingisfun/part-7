Desperate for affection, she joins Aunt CarrieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Friendship Club and strikes up a correspondence with Ray Fernandez (Tony Lo Bianco), a suave, charismatic smooth talker who could be the man of her dreamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or a wicked con artist bound for trouble. Based on a true story and filmed in documentary-style black and white, The Honeymoon Killers is a stark portrayal of the desperate lengths to which a lonely heart will go to find true love, from brutally immoral killings to a passion that transcends all bounds.\n\n________________________________\n\nDVDrip \n\nName..........: The.Honeymoon.Killers.1969.DVDRip.XviD.avi\nFilesize......: 1.3Gb\nRuntime.......: 01:47:53\nVideo Codec...: XviD\nVideo Bitrate.: 1.6Mbps\nFrame Size....: 640x352\nFrame Rate....: 23.97fps\nAudio Codec...:\nAudio Bitrate.: 192Kbps\nAudio Freq....: 48KHz\nAudio Channels: Mono ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbaae56c7c8234efa28aec3d486834106a437efd","amp;dn":"The+Honeymoon+Killers+%28Leonard+Kastle%2C+1969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbaae56c7c8234efa28aec3d486834106a437efd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,170,229,108,124,130,52,239,162,138,236,61,72,104,52,16,106,67,126,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
