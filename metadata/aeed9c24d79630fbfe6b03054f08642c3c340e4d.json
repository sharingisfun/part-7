It was a major commercial success, reaching #1 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, and featuring three top-5 singles; &quot;Lookin' Out My Back Door&quot; (US #2), &quot;Travelin' Band&quot; (US #2), and &quot;Up Around the Bend&quot; (US #4) were all big hits, the latter two released before they were included in this album. It also reached #11 on what was then the Billboard Soul Albums chart, a crossover feat nearly unheard of for a white pop/rock band. In Britain it was their only No. 1 album, entering the chart at that position. In 2003, the album was ranked number 262 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe name of the album comes from the warehouse in Berkeley where the band rehearsed. Bandleader John Fogerty was so insistent on practising (nearly every day) that drummer Doug &quot;Cosmo&quot; Clifford began referring to the place as &quot;the factory&quot;.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeed9c24d79630fbfe6b03054f08642c3c340e4d","amp;dn":"Creedence+Clearwater+Revival+-+Cosmo%5C%27s+Factory+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeed9c24d79630fbfe6b03054f08642c3c340e4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,237,156,36,215,150,48,251,254,107,3,5,79,8,100,44,60,52,14,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
