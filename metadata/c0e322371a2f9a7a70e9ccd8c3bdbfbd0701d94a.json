In 2007, EuroMold attracted more than 1,600 exhibitors and 65,000 visitors. \n\nThose who visit the ESPRIT booth can expect one-on-one interaction with staff from DP Technology, as well as demonstrations of new software upgrades.\n\nThis latest version of the ESPRIT software is the result of a balanced effort focusing on both the shorter terms needs of its existing customers and the longer term direction of the metal-working community. A significant number of new, innovative technologies in the areas of 3- and 5-axis milling, feature recognition and user interface are being introduced with this new version, as well as a long list of productivity enhancing features for milling, turning and wire EDM part programming. ESPRIT 2009 is designed to run on both the Microsoft Windows XP and Microsoft Vista operating systems. \n\nThe latest release of ESPRIT Mold includes significant performance increases for the 3D programmer that result in the reduction of cycle times of 25-50 percent or more while simultaneously increasing part quality and reducing programming time and effort. \n\nOn display at EuroMold 2008, enhancements within ESPRIT 2009 and ESPRIT Mold v10 reduce the time required to produce part programs, increase the quality of those programs and help reduce machining cycle times.
