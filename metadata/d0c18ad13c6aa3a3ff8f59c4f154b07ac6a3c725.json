For example, the very first exercise given is to print \n&quot;hello, world&quot; became a standard way of introducing new language in a \nprogramming books.  Not for the beginner, you need to know well at \nleast one other language before reading this book. Might serve as a \nquick reference too. Written when memory was expensive, hence it takes \nall the short cuts to save storage. Therefore some examples \n(hort implementation of famous UNIX commands) are no longer represent \nrecommended way of coding them. \n\nIt shows its age. In 2003 one can see weaknesses and their \ntool-oriented approach looks somewhat naive in view of existence of \nscripting languages like Perl, Python, TCL, etc.  Still it is a \nvaluable book that somewhat illuminated (sometimes questionable) \ntradeoffs in designing C as a hybrid of BCPL and PL/1.  From the point \nof view of PL/1 heritage especially problematic was C treatment of \nstrings (downgrading them into a library) and you can find some \ninteresting info about this design decision in the book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0c18ad13c6aa3a3ff8f59c4f154b07ac6a3c725","amp;dn":"The+C+Programming+Language+ANSI+C+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0c18ad13c6aa3a3ff8f59c4f154b07ac6a3c725","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,193,138,209,60,106,163,163,255,143,89,196,241,84,176,122,198,163,199,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
