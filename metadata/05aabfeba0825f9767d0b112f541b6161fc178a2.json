Today, March 20 of 2016, I am releasing an ENTIRELY NEW repack of the Full Sims 3 Store that is much faster to run and way easier to install!\r\n\r\nJust copy two folders and you are done!! No need to run the launcher!!!\r\n\r\nYou can see how I did it in my video @YouTube:\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!!!\r\n\r\nPS: I added, as a bonus, Blue River, a huge world I created for the game, with hundreds of lots (it's an Alpha release, but you can play with it) and also a couple (very few) special custom content that I used with it, like rugs that can be used as rabbit holes, a nice ladder that only takes one square and a ramp for your cars or disabled sims!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05aabfeba0825f9767d0b112f541b6161fc178a2","amp;dn":"The+Sims+3+-+Full+Store+%2B+Blue+River+2016+Repack+by+SimArchitect","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05aabfeba0825f9767d0b112f541b6161fc178a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,170,191,235,160,130,95,151,103,208,177,18,245,65,182,22,31,193,120,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
