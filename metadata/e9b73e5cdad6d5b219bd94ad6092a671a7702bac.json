Pioneered a decade ago for satellite remote sensing, eCognition enables geospatial data such as images, point clouds and Geographic Information System (GIS) vectors to be integrated and analyzed to quantify features or  detect changes over time.\n\neCognition 9 simplifies and reduces the time  taken to classify objects in imagery data sets using the new template matching function. Object templates can now be quickly and easily  defined, providing the software with an object library that is used to automatically identify corresponding objects in new imagery data sets.\n\nWebsite : http://www.ecognition.com/products/ecognition-developer\n\nWhats new in version 9 : http://www.ecognition.com/sites/default/files/What%27s%20New%20in%20eCognition%209.0%20-%20v1.4.pdf\n\nHow to - \n1.
