Cristaldi, Salvatore Pennisi, Francesco Pulvirenti, &quot;Liquid Crystal Display Drivers: Techniques and Circuits&quot;\nSpringer | 2009-04-01 | ISBN: 9048122546 | 298 pages | PDF | 10,8 MB\n\nLiquid Crystal Display Drivers deals with Liquid Crystal Displays from the electronic engineering point of view and is the first expressively focused on their driving circuits. After introducing the physical-chemical properties of the LC substances, their evolution and application to LCDs, the book converges to the examination and in-depth explanation of those reliable techniques, architectures, and design solutions amenable to efficiently design drivers for passive-matrix and active-matrix LCDs, both for small size and large size panels. Practical approaches regularly adopted for mass production but also emerging ones are discussed. The topics treated have in many cases general validity and found application also in alternative display technologies (OLEDs, Electrophoretic Displays, etc.).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d19daa193f327b034e49d788369fb714e1b80e1","amp;dn":"Liquid+Crystal+Display+Drivers+Techniques+and+Circuits+-+%28Malest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d19daa193f327b034e49d788369fb714e1b80e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,25,218,161,147,243,39,176,52,228,157,120,131,105,251,113,78,27,128,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
