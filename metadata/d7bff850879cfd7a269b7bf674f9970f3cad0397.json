Very useful for teaching, great lesson ideas for conversational English classes.  If you find them useful too, please share!  \n\nP.S. - all files are Open Office documents (.odt).  I doubt MS office can open them, but if it wont, why not try open office?  They probably have a torrent on TPB somewhere...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7bff850879cfd7a269b7bf674f9970f3cad0397","amp;dn":"ESL+Teacher%5C%27s+Conversation+Pack2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7bff850879cfd7a269b7bf674f9970f3cad0397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,191,248,80,135,156,253,122,38,155,123,246,116,249,151,15,60,173,3,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
