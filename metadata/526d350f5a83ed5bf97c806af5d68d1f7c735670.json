In this fascinating survey on art, artists, and anarchism, Allan Antliff interrogates critical moments when anarchist artists have confronted pivotal events over the past 140 years. \n\nThe survey begins with Gustave Courbet's activism during the 1871 Paris Commune (which established the French republic) and ends with anarchist art during the fall of the Soviet empire. Other subjects include the French neoimpressionists, the Dada movement in New York, anarchist art during the Russian Revolution, political art of the 1960s, and gay art and politics post-World War II. Throughout, Antliff vividly explores art's potential as a vehicle for social change and how it can also shape the course of political events, both historic and present-day; it is a book for the politically engaged and art aficionados alike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:526d350f5a83ed5bf97c806af5d68d1f7c735670","amp;dn":"Anarchy+and+Art+-+From+the+Paris+Commune+to+the+Fall+of+the+Berl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"526d350f5a83ed5bf97c806af5d68d1f7c735670","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,109,53,15,90,131,237,91,249,124,128,106,245,214,141,31,124,115,86,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
