Chronicling the band members from boyhood through the band's first record, cut in 1963, this biography contains rare photographs and never before published interviews with family members as well as every member who played with the band prior to the recognized line-upÃ¢â‚¬â€including pre-Watts drummers Erky Grant and Mick Avory; Mick JaggerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cousin, Rick Huxley; early Stones member Dick Taylor; and Phil May, a schoolmate of Jagger and Richards and member of The Pretty Things. Every aspect of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development is explored, from their recording sessions to landing on the music charts, in this myth-shattering musical history.\n\nPublisher: Chrome Dreams; First Edition edition (8 July 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1842403893\nISBN-13: 978-1842403891\n\nMost Helpful Customer Reviews\n\nA great read\nBy Customer on 14 Jan 2008\nI am a great fan of Alan Clayson, as i'm sure many of you are. He seems to like all the same music as me, and therefore, writes a number of books which I find very interesting. Of course bands such as Radiohead and the Stones arent bands lacking in fanbase. The book itself offered a great insight into the stones lives before i became enamoured with them. Clayson is a fantastic writer, his style is one that i'm sure can be appreciated by anyone. Any Stones fan should own this!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:819185b36ddfc2ce10bb51e525288975f751012a","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+%3A+The+Origin+of+the+Species+How%2C+Why+and+Wher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"819185b36ddfc2ce10bb51e525288975f751012a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,145,133,179,109,223,194,206,16,187,81,229,37,40,137,117,247,81,1,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
