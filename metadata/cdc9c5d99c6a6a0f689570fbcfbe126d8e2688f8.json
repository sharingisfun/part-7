I downloaded a FLAC of the album, encoded it to 320 VBR. Aspiration has the lowest bit rate at 309. Enjoy, and seed the hell out of this! I tagged it properly in Itunes, added the lyrics, and album artwork is tagged onto the files, so it all should work. Regardless, the album art is included in the folder as well.\n\nJust so it's known, this IS a compressed file, and the files are all there, just as described. So don't get discouraged by the compression!! I couldn't get TPB to allow me to upload anything but a compressed file, and I knew this was needed, 320 LEGIT!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdc9c5d99c6a6a0f689570fbcfbe126d8e2688f8","amp;dn":"After+The+Burial+Rareform+%28Re-Issue%29+320KBPS+VBR+LEGIT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdc9c5d99c6a6a0f689570fbcfbe126d8e2688f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,201,197,217,156,106,106,15,104,149,112,251,207,190,18,109,142,38,136,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
