They decide to rob a store, to get some money and clothes and travel by ship to another place. They pretend to be there to fix the roof, but pretty soon they realize that the financial condition of the family Ducotel is not good. Andre Tochard, the selfish and mean owner of the establishment, exploits the family Ducotel. The three convicts spend Christmas night with the Ducotels and are so well treated by the family that they decide to help them. Their pet will help them to fix the situation. \n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO\n\nLength: 01:41:35\nFrame Width: 608\nFrame Height: 336\nData Rate: 677kbps\nTotal Bitrate: 762kbps\nFrame Rate: 25 frames/second\n\n\nAUDIO\n\nBit Rate: 84kbps\nChannels: 2 (stereo)\nAudio Sample Rate: 48 kHz\n\n\nFILE\n\nItem Type: Avi\nSize: 553 MB\n\n\n\nScreen: http://bayimg.com/maGpcaAEM\n\n\n\n\nTHIS IS A VERY HARD TO FIND CHRISTMAS MOVIE, SO PLEASE ENJOY AND SEED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b68efbb9d436c52ab6d0910dfa9aa1fceb21ef2","amp;dn":"We%27re+No+Angels+%5B1955%5D+DvDrip+%5BEng%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b68efbb9d436c52ab6d0910dfa9aa1fceb21ef2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,104,239,187,157,67,108,82,171,109,9,16,223,169,170,31,206,178,30,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
