From UPI he moved to CNN, where he eventually became executive producer of its Washington-based public policy programming. In 1994 he began work on his first novel, The Unlikely Spy, a surprise best seller that won critical acclaim. He turned to writing full time in 1997 and all of his books have been New York Times/national best sellers, translated into 25 languages and published across Europe and the world. His latest book is The Secret Servant (Penguin, 2007). He lives in Washington, D.C.\n\nMichael Osbourne\n1. The Mark of the Assassin (1998)\n2. The Marching Season (1999)\n\nGabriel Allon\n1.

Literally outside of Clancy, Flynn, Thor, and Ludlum, one of the best and freshest spy thriller writers in my opinion. Sure there are other spy fiction thriller writers but those 3 are the benchmarks and Daniel Silva is right there at the top.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e31e9b51dd760a3d62b5bebbbd5ef4dc25e61ac","amp;dn":"Daniel+Silva+Bibliography+%28ePub%2C+Mobi%2C+AZW3+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e31e9b51dd760a3d62b5bebbbd5ef4dc25e61ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,49,233,181,29,215,96,163,214,43,91,235,187,213,239,77,194,94,97,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
