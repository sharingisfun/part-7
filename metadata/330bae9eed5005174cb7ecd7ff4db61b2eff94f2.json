YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover at what stages to prototype, test, and implement mechanics in games and learn how to visualize and simulate game mechanics in order to design better games. Along the way, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll practice what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned with hands-on lessons. A free downloadable simulation tool developed by Joris Dormans is also available in order to follow along with exercises in the book in an easy-to-use graphical environment.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
