It was not released until 1995, discovered in 1994 by his wife, Alice Coltrane, who plays the piano on the session.\nStellar Regions represents yet another of his studio explorations in which he stretched the never ending limits of free jazz, and finds him traveling on trails of cosmic dust. \nThe music here is absolutely wonderful. This is an amazing collection of compositions and improvisations from a master of sound.\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3d3fa814225bbb7f9fff728897e6691d6bf3c41","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Stellar+Regions+1967","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3d3fa814225bbb7f9fff728897e6691d6bf3c41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,211,250,129,66,37,187,183,249,255,247,40,137,126,102,145,214,191,60,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
