Converging towards the hybrid animation of his early short films, La Femme qui se poudre and DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©jeuner du matin, Bokanowski's curious, often gothic figurations reveal an abstract logic of thematic suites that similarly reveal his penchant for juxtaposing optical experimentation with traditional fine arts, where rended objects (a doll used as a fencing target in L'Homme au sabre), accidental ruptures (a pitcher falls from the dinner table in L'Homme sans mains), and bursts of activity (a bather splashes animatedly in L'Homme au bain, and a group of identical librarians research, file, and reorganize a sprawling library in Les BibliothÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©caires) reflect an overarching, universal law of entropy that, paradoxically, enables creation from the very act of friction, disorder, kinesis, and destruction.\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: Patrick Bokanowski - L'ange (1982).avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,040,369,664 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:04:07\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 608x448 (AR: 1.357)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 2011 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.295 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 140 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\nThanks fitz for the rip and torrent\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
