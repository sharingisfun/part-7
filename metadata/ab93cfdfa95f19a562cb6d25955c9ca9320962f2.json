A quartet of accomplished musical pedigrees, the band first exploded onto the Irish folk music scene in 2008 with their self-titled debut CD and DVD and was introduced to American audiences on Public Television. They have sold out hundreds of shows, in Ireland and the US, made numerous TV appearances and achieved platinum status in Ireland with both albums. On their new album Memory Lane, The High Kings showcase their incredible versatility and skills as multi-instrumentalists, playing 13 instruments between the four of them, bringing a rousing acoustic flavor to brand new songs as well as some old favorites.
