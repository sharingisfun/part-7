A single mother, she manages her well-ordered career meticulously, always prepared on the air or interviewing world-renowned figures and heads of state. To her audience, Blaise seems to have it all. But privately, and off the set, there is another untold story she has kept hidden for years.\n\nBlaiseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teenage daughter, Salima, was blinded by Type 1 diabetes in childhood, and her needs have kept her away in a year-round boarding school with full-time medical care and assistance ever since. When SalimaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s school closes after a tragedy, Salima returns to her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New York City apartment, and suddenly they face challenges theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never had to deal with before, and that Blaise feels ill-equipped to handle. A new caretaker provided by SalimaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s school creates as many problems as he solves. Handsome, accomplished, thirty-two-year-old Simon Ward, with strong opinions on every topic, questions how mother and daughter view themselves and each other. Simon opens new doors for both of them and refuses to accept SalimaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s physical limitations. He turns their world upside down, and the three become friends.\n\nThen everything starts to unravel and Blaise canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep her two worlds separate anymore. A beautiful young anchorwoman is hired at the network; it is no secret that she is being groomed to take BlaiseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place. Her career as she has known it is threatened, and her previously well-ordered life feels totally out of control. For the first time, BlaiseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life is not perfect, but real.\n\nIn this unforgettable tale, the incomparable Danielle Steel has written a novel that pulsates with emotion and honesty as three people face the truth about themselves. A Perfect Life is about what we do when facades fall away and we can no longer run from the truth. As old ideas fail, everything changes, and life is suddenly brand-new.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1abf7791a5ad54e10b48de11e59a8f1bdc6b8359","amp;dn":"A+Perfect+Life+-+Danielle+Steel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1abf7791a5ad54e10b48de11e59a8f1bdc6b8359","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,191,119,145,165,173,84,225,11,72,222,17,229,154,143,27,220,107,131,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
