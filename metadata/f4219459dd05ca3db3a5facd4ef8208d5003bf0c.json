Smith \r\nEnglish | 2016 | Mystery, Short Stories | 2.7 MB \r\n\r\nâ€œâ€˜Is it really possible, do you suppose,â€™ said Sherlock Holmes to me one morning, as we took breakfast together, â€˜that a healthy and robust man may be so stricken with terror that he drops down dead?â€™â€ \r\nThe much praised Denis O. Smith introduces twelve new Sherlockian stories in this collection, including â€œThe Adventure of the XYZ Club,â€ â€œThe Secret of Shoreswood Hall,â€ and â€œThe Adventure of the Brown Box.â€ Set in the late nineteenth century before Holmesâ€™s disappearance at the Reichenbach Falls, these stories, written in the vein of the originals, recreate Arthur Conan Doyleâ€™s world with deft fidelity, from manner of speech and character traits to plot unfoldings and the historical period. Whether in fogbound London or deep in the countryside, the worldâ€™s most beloved detective is brought vividly back to life in all his enigmatic, compelling glory, embarking on seemingly impenetrable mysteries with Dr. Watson by his side. \r\nFor readers who can never get enough of Holmes, this satisfyingly hefty anthology builds on the old Conan Doyle to develop familiar characters in ways the originals could not. Both avid fans and a new generation of audiences are sure to be entertained with this continuation of the Sherlock Holmes legacy. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4219459dd05ca3db3a5facd4ef8208d5003bf0c","amp;dn":"The+Mammoth+Book+of+the+New+Chronicles+of+Sherlock+Holmes-12+Ori","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4219459dd05ca3db3a5facd4ef8208d5003bf0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,33,148,89,221,5,202,61,179,165,250,205,78,248,32,141,80,3,191,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
