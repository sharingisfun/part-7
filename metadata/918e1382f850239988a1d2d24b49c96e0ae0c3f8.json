It is for developers who are looking to build ambitious and large web applications that rival native applications. Ember.js was created from concepts introduced by native application frameworks, such as Cocoa. Ember.js helps you to create great experiences for the user. It will help you to organize all the direct interactions a user may perform on your website. A common use case for Ember.js is when you believe your JavaScript code will become complex; when the code base becomes complex, problems about maintaining and refactoring the code base will arise. MVC stands for model-view-controller. This kind of structure makes it easy to make modifications or refactor changes to any part of your code. It will also allow you to adhere to Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principles. The model is responsible for notifying associated\nviews and controllers when there has been a change in the state of the application. \n\nThe controller sends CRUD requests to the model to notify it of a change in state. It can also send requests to the view to change how the view is representing the current state of the model. The view will then receive information from the model to create a graphical rendering. \n\nBook details :\n\nFormat : pdf \nLanguage : English\nTitle : ember.js application development how to  \npages : 48\nsize : 3.9 Mb\n\nFollow us on facebook...\n\nhttp:// www. facebook. com/ torrentsharing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:918e1382f850239988a1d2d24b49c96e0ae0c3f8","amp;dn":"ember.js+application+development+how+to++%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+Torrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"918e1382f850239988a1d2d24b49c96e0ae0c3f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,142,19,130,248,80,35,153,136,161,210,210,75,73,201,110,10,224,195,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
