In Adaptogens, authors David Winston and Steven Maimes provide a comprehensive look into adaptogens, non-toxic herbs such as ginseng, eleuthero, and licorice, that produce a defensive response to stress in our bodies. Formerly known as rejuvenating herbs or tonics, adaptogens help the body to Ã¢â‚¬Å“adaptÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the many influences it encounters. They increase stamina and counter the normal effects of aging and thus are becoming important tools in sports medicine and in the prevention and treatment of chronic fatigue and other stress-related disorders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35f3578e3f9400f9b23797681c92c06dd9232594","amp;dn":"Adaptogens%3A+Herbs+for+Strength%2C+Stamina%2C+and+Stress+Relief","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35f3578e3f9400f9b23797681c92c06dd9232594","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,243,87,142,63,148,0,249,178,55,151,104,28,146,192,109,217,35,37,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
