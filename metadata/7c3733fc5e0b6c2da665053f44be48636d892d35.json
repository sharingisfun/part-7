The story is told from the point of view of an accomplished aging 50-year-old Viennese courtesan who is looking back upon the sexual escapades she enjoyed during her unbridled youth in Vienna. Contrary to the what the title indicates, almost the entirety of the book takes place when Josephine is between the ages of 5Ã¢â‚¬â€œ12 years old, before she actually becomes a licensed prostitute in the brothels of Vienna. The book begins when she is five years old and ends when she is twelve years old and about to enter professional service in a brothel.\n\nAlthough the book makes use of many &quot;euphemisms&quot; for human anatomy and sexual behavior that seem quaint today, its content is entirely pornographic. The actual progression of events amounts to little more than a graphic, unapologetic description of the reckless sexuality exhibited by the heroine, all before reaching her 13th year. The style bears more than a passing resemblance to the Marquis de Sade's The 120 Days of Sodom in its unabashed &quot;laundry list&quot; cataloging of all manner of taboo sexual antics from incest, rape and homosexuality to child prostitution, group sex and fellatio.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c3733fc5e0b6c2da665053f44be48636d892d35","amp;dn":"The+Memoirs+of+Josephine+Mutzenbacher+1906+%28german+Josefine+Mutz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c3733fc5e0b6c2da665053f44be48636d892d35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,55,51,252,94,11,108,45,166,101,5,63,68,190,72,99,109,137,45,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
