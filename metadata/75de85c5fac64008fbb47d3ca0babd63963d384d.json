At the time of Buckley's ascendance in the mid-'90s, both his high-flying vocal attack and his edgy poetic sense struck older listeners as genetic markers from his father, folk-rock legend Tim Buckley. Yet Buckley fils pursued a much more electric, rock-ribbed style, nodding toward behemoths like Pearl Jam and even Led Zeppelin.\nThis 1995 concert is a single, complete show from the tour that yielded the posthumous Mystery White Boy live album. It likewise impresses, both for Buckley's own songs and the bold cover choices included, here including songs associated with Nina Simone and the MC5 (a range that explains the emotional epics that Buckley favors).\n\n\nSongs\n\n&quot;Dream Brother&quot;\n&quot;Lover, You Should Have Come Over&quot;\n&quot;Mojo Pin&quot;\n&quot;So Real&quot;\n&quot;Last Goodbye&quot;\n&quot;Eternal Life&quot;\n&quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; (MC5)\n&quot;Lilac Wine&quot; (Nina Simone)\n&quot;What Will You Say&quot;\n&quot;Grace&quot;\n&quot;Vancouver&quot; (instrumental)\n&quot;Kanga Roo&quot; (Big Star)\n&quot;Hallelujah&quot; (Leonard Cohen)\n\nBonus\n\n&quot;So Real&quot; (acoustic) (Recorded November 19, 1994)\n&quot;Last Goodbye&quot; (acoustic) (Recorded November 19, 1994)\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nJeff Buckley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, guitar\nMichael Tighe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nMick Grondahl ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar\nMatt Johnson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\n\n\nTech Info\n\nConcert\nLength: 1h 37mn 43s\nVideo: Xvid at 1164 Kbps\n576 x 432 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\nAudio: MP3 at 256 Kbps\n2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nBonus\nTotal Length: 25mn 54s\nVideo1: Xvid at 1237 Kbps\n592 x 448 (1.321) at 25.000 fps\nVideo2: Xvid at 1161 Kbps\n576 x 432 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\nAudio: MP3 at 256 Kbps\n2 channels, 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75de85c5fac64008fbb47d3ca0babd63963d384d","amp;dn":"Jeff+Buckley+-+Live+In+Chicago+1995+%28DVD+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75de85c5fac64008fbb47d3ca0babd63963d384d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,222,133,197,250,198,64,8,251,180,125,60,160,186,189,99,150,61,56,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
