Eccentric frontman Question Mark (actually spelled &quot;?,&quot; once he had his name legally changed) cultivated an aura of mystery by never appearing in public without a pair of wraparound sunglasses; he frequently claimed he had been born on Mars and lived among the dinosaurs in a past life, and that voices from the future had revealed he would be performing &quot;96 Tears&quot; in the year 10,000. On a more earthly level, the Mysterians' sound helped lay down an important part of the garage rock blueprint, namely the low-budget sci-fi feel of the Farfisa and Vox organs (most assumed that &quot;96 Tears&quot; had featured the former, but ? later remembered using the latter). What was more, they were one of the first Latino rock groups to have a major hit, and ?'s sneering attitude made him one of the prime suspects in the evolution of garage rock into early punk.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0ifpxqr5ldje~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0ifpxqr5ldje~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):\n\nAbkco's 2005 compilation The Best of ? &amp; the Mysterians: Cameo Parkway 1966-1967 is the first official CD release of the Michigan garage rocker's classic Cameo Parkway recordings, but for hardcore garage rock collectors, it might look a little bit similar to a 1995 unofficial release called Original Recordings. The discs not only share 25 tracks but they're presented in the same sequencing. Then again, that shouldn't be a surprise since both discs contain the entirety of the quintet's two full-length LPs -- the 1966 96 Tears and its 1967 follow-up Action -- plus the &quot;Do Something to Me&quot;/&quot;Love Me Baby (Cherry July)&quot; single. The '95 release contains five tracks that didn't make it to this release, but this has two previously unreleased versions of &quot;Midnight Hour&quot; and &quot;96 Tears,&quot; neither of which were as a good as the released versions (the alternate &quot;96 Tears&quot; is surprisingly limp, actually). As should be expected from an official release, Abkco's Best Of has much better sound -- clean, but retaining the grit and murk that distinguished the Mysterians' LPs -- and a good set of liner notes from Jeff Tamarkin that detail the history of this shadowy band. Their music remains a little hit and miss -- only &quot;96 Tears&quot; is a stone-cold classic, and it's surely one of the great rock &amp; roll singles ever, but they have several other strong garage rockers, particularly on the second album -- but despite the handful of generic moments, it's still a blessing that the original ? &amp; the Mysterians records have not only finally made it to CD, but in such an appealing fashion as this.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:wifexqqdldse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:wifexqqdldse&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000B8I8XC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000B8I8XC&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
