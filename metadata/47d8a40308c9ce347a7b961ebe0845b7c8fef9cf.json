His works are characterised by deep psychological analysis, a certain sense of paradox and absurd, anti-nationalist flavor. In 1937 he published his first novel, Ferdydurke, which presented many of his usual themes: the problems of immaturity and youth, the creation of identity in interactions with others, and an ironic, critical examination of class roles in Polish society and culture. He gained fame only during the last years of his life, but is now considered one of the foremost figures of Polish literature.\n\nThe salient characteristics of GombrowiczÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing include incisive descriptions of characters' psychological entanglement with others, an acute awareness of conflicts that arise when traditional cultural values clash with contemporary values, and an exasperated yet comedic sense of the absurd. Aesthetically, Gombrowicz's clear and precise descriptions criticise Polish Romanticism, and he once claimed he wrote in defiance of Adam Mickiewicz (especially in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trans-AtlanticÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). The writing of Gombrowicz contains links with existentialism and with structuralism. Gombrowicz's work is also well known for its playful allusions and satire, as when in &quot;Trans-Atlantic&quot;, a section of the text takes the form of a stylised 19th century diary, followed by a parody of a traditional fable.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* A Guide to Philosophy in Six Hours and Fifteen Minutes (2007, Yale University Press)\n\n* Cosmos (2011, Grove Press)\n\n* Diary (2012, Yale University Press)\n\n* Ferdydurke (1979, Yale University Press)\n\n* Trans-Atlantyk (1994, Yale University)\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gombrowicz.net/-Witold-Gombrowicz-English-version-.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gombrowicz.net/-Witold-Gombrowicz-English-version-.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wordswithoutborders.org/article/witold-gombrowicz-and-to-hell-with-culture&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wordswithoutborders.org/article/witold-gombrowicz-and-to-hell-with-culture&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witold_Gombrowicz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witold_Gombrowicz&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47d8a40308c9ce347a7b961ebe0845b7c8fef9cf","amp;dn":"Witold+Gombrowicz+-+Polish+Author+%285+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47d8a40308c9ce347a7b961ebe0845b7c8fef9cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,216,164,3,8,201,206,52,122,123,150,30,190,8,69,183,200,254,249,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
