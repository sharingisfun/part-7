We are also setting up a library of workshop videos at the VCD website to help you get the most out of Virtual CD.\n- Extended task assignment options. The task assignment dialogs in Virtual CD made version 10 easier to use than its predecessors. In Virtual CD 10.1 even more options have been added to these dialogs, so you can choose from a broader range of tasks to be executed on double-click. Even the selection of post-CD burning actions has been extended.\n- Extended options for desktop drive icons. The drive icons that Virtual CD creates on the desktop are among the most popular features in Virtual CD 10. Especially for USB flash drives and other removable media, these functions mark a tremendous gain in convenience. In the 10.1 update, the display options in this feature have been enhanced.\n- New options in the Image Wizard and Image Writer. Now you can add more files to images. You can also interrupt the creation process and restart it at a later pointÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the process picks up where it left off.\n- Improved file system compatibility for VCD images. The image files created by Virtual CD can sometimes exceed the handling capacity of certain file systems. That is why we have now integrated the option of dividing large image files into multiple smaller files. This feature can be enabled globally, so that it is active by default, or individually, while creating an image.\n\n- Improvements in the CD Control Center and the Editor. The comprehensive filtering and display options have been expanded yet again, so that even large CD collections can be searched quickly and easily for a particular track. In the Editor, working sequences have been further optimized for faster results than ever.\n\nCorrections\n\n- The Conversion Wizard reported an invalid path if the target was entered without its directory in a share.  \n\n- Some programs did not recognize the virtual burner as a burner. \n\n- Under some circumstances an inserted image was designated as a DVD-R, which sometimes caused problems with software from other manufacturers. \n\n- Some burner software attempts to write 0 sectors under certain circumstances. To ensure compatibility, this is no longer handled as an error.  \n\n- Compatibility with BD burners has been improved.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c5533e0673cb4cae3ccce4e1549d431bc58b1d7","amp;dn":"Virtual+CD+v+10.1.0.13+Retail+%28en-de%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c5533e0673cb4cae3ccce4e1549d431bc58b1d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,85,51,224,103,60,180,202,227,204,206,78,21,73,212,49,188,88,177,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
