Keesling, who worked for a sex therapist as a surrogate partner for 10 years before becoming one herself, explores the inhibitions that women have about sex, and explains how you can dress, speak, walk, tease, use sex toys, give blow jobs and have orgasms like the bad girl of your dreams. In addition, Keesling, herself a former good girl meaning that like most women, she had learned to hide her wild desires from the world offers her personal story as inspiration for all women who want to learn how to feel good about being bad.\n\nFile Format: PDF\nFile Size: 1015 KB\nPaperback: 240 pages\nPublisher: M.
