He wrote the very first For Dummies book in 1991 and now has more than 11 million copies of books in print. He combines his love of writing with his gizmo fascination to create books that are informative, entertaining, and not boring. Having written more over 120 titles with 12 million copies in print translated into over 30 languages, Dan can attest that his method of crafting computer tomes seems to work.\r\nPerhaps his most famous title is the original DOS For Dummies, published in 1991. It became the world's fastest-selling computer book, at one time moving more copies per week than the New York Times #1 bestseller (though as a reference, it could not be listed on the NYT Bestseller list). From that book spawned the entire line of For Dummies books, which remains a publishing phenomena to this day.\r\nDan holds a degree in Communications/Visual Arts from the University of California, San Diego. Presently, he lives in the Pacific Northwest, where he enjoys spending time with his sons playing video games inside while they watch the gentle woods of Idaho.\r\n \nhttp://s28.postimg.org/4b0xhrlx9/Android_Phones_For_Dummies_3rd_Ed.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dab494a9079d69d486eca1a8d8ba058f5726e1da","amp;dn":"Android+Phones+For+Dummies+%283rd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dab494a9079d69d486eca1a8d8ba058f5726e1da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,180,148,169,7,157,105,212,134,236,161,168,216,186,5,143,87,38,225,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
