Endowed with the rich heritage of Roman, Eastern and Christian cultures, Byzantine artists developed an architectural and pictorial tradition, marked by symbolism, whose influence extended far beyond the borders of the Empire. Today, Italy, Northern Africa, and the Near East preserve the vestiges of this sophisticated artistic tradition, with all of its mystical and luminous beauty. The magnificence of the palaces, churches, paintings, enamels, ceramics and mosaics from this civilisation guarantees Byzantine art's powerful influence and timelessness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94e322ffd6394f1256b56ebbd91801529782c98c","amp;dn":"Byzantine+Art+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94e322ffd6394f1256b56ebbd91801529782c98c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,227,34,255,214,57,79,18,86,181,110,187,217,24,1,82,151,130,201,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
