Until the skull begins to reveal its shocking identity - it belongs to a man who's supposed to be alive, a man of vital importance to the nation. Then Eve finds she has some powerful enemies. So begins the popular series as Eve Duncan uses her talent not only to find missing persons but find the remains of her daughter Bonnie. She is aided by Atlanta detective Jo Quinn.\n\nThe Killing Game\nThe killer knew Eve Duncan all too well. He knew the pain she felt for her murdered daughter, Bonnie, whose body was never found. He knew that as one of the nation's top forensic sculptors she would insist on identifying nine skeletons unearthed on a bluff near Georgia's Talladega Falls. And he knew that she wouldn't be able to resist the temptation of believing that one of those skeletons - the one belonging to a young girl - might be Bonnie's.. &quot;But that is only the beginning of the killer's sadistic game. Soon the calls begin to come.\n\nThe Search\nA character join the series - Sarah Patrick is being forced to take part in a deadly mission by a man who knows enough about her past to ensure her cooperation. John Logan - a man who won't take no for an answer. As part of an elite K-9 search and rescue team, Sarah and her golden retriever Monty, have a gift for finding what no one else can - whether it's a survivor buried alive by an earthquake or the skeleton of a murdered child. Once Sarah starts the perilous assignment, she realizes Logan's promise that she will be safe may not be enough to protect her.
