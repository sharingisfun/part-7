He was also more involved in the production of this album, collaborating with producers Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis, Dallas Austin, Bill Bottrell and R. Kelly.\n\nSony Music backed the album&amp;#039;s promotion with a 30 million dollar promotion and marketing campaign, the largest budget set for an album at that time. The campaign included a full set of singles and music videos, television and radio advertising, an 82 concert world tour, and eventually a remix album. Reviews were mixed and Jackson was ridiculed in the press for his promotional campaign of erecting statues of himself around Europe and floating himself down the River Thames.\n\nFor the first time in his career, Jackson significantly utilizes coarse language on this album, the majority of which are still not allowed on network television in the United States. Michael also experimented with more genres on HIStory than on any other album, ranging from orchestral to adult contemporary rhythm and blues to &quot;Gothic pop&quot;.\n\nDisc one: HIStory Begins\n\n   1. &quot;Billie Jean&quot; (Jackson) ? 4:54\n   2. &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; (Jackson) ? 4:57\n   3. &quot;Black or White&quot; (Jackson/Bottrell) ? 4:15\n   4. &quot;Rock with You&quot; (Temperton) ? 3:40\n   5. &quot;She&amp;#039;s out of My Life&quot; (Bahler) ? 3:38\n   6. &quot;Bad&quot; (Jackson) ? 4:07\n   7. &quot;I Just Can&amp;#039;t Stop Loving You&quot; featuring Siedah Garrett (Jackson) ? 4:12\n   8. &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; (Ballard/Garrett) ? 5:19\n   9. &quot;Thriller&quot; (Temperton/Jackson) ? 5:57\n  10. &quot;Beat It&quot; (Jackson) ? 4:18\n  11. &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; featuring Paul McCartney (Jackson) ? 3:41\n  12. &quot;Remember the Time&quot; (Riley/Jackson/Belle) ? 3:59\n  13. &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Stop &amp;#039;Til You Get Enough&quot; (Jackson) ? 6:05\n  14. &quot;Wanna Be Startin&amp;#039; Somethin&amp;#039;&quot; (Jackson) ? 6:04\n  15. &quot;Heal the World&quot; (Jackson) ? 6:24\n\n[edit] Disc two: HIStory Continues\n\n   1. &quot;Scream&quot; featuring Janet Jackson (Harris/Lewis/Jackson/Jackson) ? 4:38\n   2. &quot;They Don&amp;#039;t Care About Us&quot; (Jackson) ? 4:44\n   3. &quot;Stranger in Moscow&quot; (Jackson) ? 5:44\n   4. &quot;This Time Around&quot; featuring The Notorious B.I.G.
