The album is most notable for its iconic Andy Warhol-designed album cover of Ross and for the Top 10, Grammy-nominated single, &quot;Muscles&quot;. It was the second album self-produced by the singer except for the aforementioned hit, which was produced and written by former Motown labelmate and longtime friend Michael Jackson. The album was certified Gold for sales surpassing 500.000 units in the United States alone.\n\nThe Andy Warhol cover design was replicated on the actual LP press, which instead of being called &quot;Side 1&quot; and &quot;Side 2&quot; were called &quot;Face A&quot; and &quot;Face B&quot;. The song &quot;Turn Me Over&quot; was actually a cue to the listener to turn the record album or cassette over to the second side or &quot;face.&quot; This cue would be unnecessary on the new CD format or in the digital MP3 world. The initial release of the LP had a clear sticker that contained the &quot;Silk Electric&quot; logo, so that once removed the cover looked like the Warhol painting without any words.\n\nDIANA ROSS Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (1982) SILK ELECTRIC\n\nStudio album by Diana Ross\nReleased: September 10, 1982\nRecorded: 1982\nGenre: Pop, R&amp;B, Funk, Disco\nLength: 37:31 (Original Album)\nLabel: RCA\nProducer: Michael Jackson, Diana Ross\n\nDiana Ross Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (1982) Silk Electric \nLabel: RCA\nFormat: CD, Album, \nCountry: USA\nReleased: 1982\nGenre: Pop, R&amp;B, Funk, Disco\nQuality: 222 to 320 kbps\nFormat: MP3 \nSource: Internet\n\n\nTRACK LISTING FOR ORIGINAL ALBUM:\n\nSide A\n\n1. &quot;Muscles&quot; (Michael Jackson) - 4:36\n2. &quot;So Close&quot; (Bill Wray, Diana Ross, Rob Mounsey) - 4:12\n3. &quot;Still In Love&quot; (Randy Handley) - 4:06\n4. &quot;Fool For Your Love&quot; (Bill Wray, Diana Ross, Ray Chew) - 3:47\n5. &quot;Turn Me Over&quot; (Diana Ross, Steve Goldstein) - 1:10\n\nSide B\n\n6. &quot;Who&quot; (Barry Blue, Rod Bowkett) - 3:45\n7. &quot;Love Lies&quot; (Allan Chapman, Michael Hanna) - 4:05\n8. &quot;In Your Arms&quot; (Linda Creed, Michael Masser) - 3:30\n9. &quot;Anywhere You Run To&quot; (David Roberts) - 3:30\n10. &quot;I Am Me&quot; (Diana Ross, Freddie Gorman, Janie Bradford) - 3:50\n\n\n\n+\n\n11.
