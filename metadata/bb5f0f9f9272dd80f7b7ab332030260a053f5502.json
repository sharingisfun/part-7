Who will now protect the innocent from the dangerous inmates of Arkham Asylum, whom Bane has released?\r\n\r\nA new hero - Azrael - takes up the mantle of the Bat. But Azrael is a more brutal Batman than Bruce Wayne, and far more eager to punish the guilty than to protect the innocent. Will he destroy Gotham City in order to save it?\r\n\r\nThis stunning audio production was first aired on BBC Radio 1, and its cliffhanging, all-action adventure can now be heard uninterrupted and remastered - complete with dazzling sound effects and specially composed orchestral music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Directed by Dirk Maggs; Performed by Bob Sessions, Michael Gough, Peter Marinker, Kerry Shale, ...\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 128 Kbps\r\nDramatization","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb5f0f9f9272dd80f7b7ab332030260a053f5502","amp;dn":"Dirk+Maggs+-+Batman+Knightfall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb5f0f9f9272dd80f7b7ab332030260a053f5502","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,95,15,159,146,114,221,128,247,183,171,51,32,48,38,10,5,63,85,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
