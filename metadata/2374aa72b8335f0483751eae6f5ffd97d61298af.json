It's confirmation that all the heaviness of the world will be held at bayÃ¢â‚¬â€if only for a little whileÃ¢â‚¬â€by a combination of bubbling mozzarella, sweet fennel sausage, and balsamic-glazed radicchio.\n\nBeginning with the &quot;Mother Crust&quot; recipe, Lenzer argues that pizza dough is a tabula rasa for whatever healthy fresh ingredients you have on hand. To make pizza a nightly affair, she suggests preparing the dough on SundayÃ¢â‚¬â€in less than 30 minutesÃ¢â‚¬â€freezing it, and simply transferring it to the fridge to thaw on the morning you plan to cook. Lenzer gives the timestrapped home cook countless combinations for a healthy, delicious (and quick!) weeknight meal.\n\nBalancing lighter healthy alternatives like Summer Squash with lemon Zest and ricotta with indulgent options such as Skirt Steak, cress, and gorgonzola, in addition to bonus recipes including &quot;Salad thoughts,&quot; &quot;Small bites,&quot; and even a few ideas about wine, this book covers all the bases. Lenzer's comforting voice adds a homey touch to her artisanal recipes and immaculately styled photos. \n\nEPUB,Retail: 240 pages\nPublisher: Rodale Books (April 7, 2015)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1623362180\nISBN-13: 978-1623362188","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2374aa72b8335f0483751eae6f5ffd97d61298af","amp;dn":"Truly+Madly+Pizza+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29+%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2374aa72b8335f0483751eae6f5ffd97d61298af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,116,170,114,184,51,95,4,131,117,30,174,111,95,253,151,214,18,152,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
