Ronnie: You rock!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db295f856d4a1727c7e1e6e62c33b567446327d3","amp;dn":"Ronnie+James+Dio%3A+36+Original+Releases+%28MP3+%40+Highest+VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db295f856d4a1727c7e1e6e62c33b567446327d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,41,95,133,109,74,23,39,199,225,230,230,44,51,181,103,68,99,39,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
