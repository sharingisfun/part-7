Harry James is the name synonymous with the trumpet.  He inspired more trumpet players than any living musician with his brilliant technique, soulful balladeering and high powered jazz solos backed by a sometimes beautiful orchestra complete with strings and most often with a thundering, swinging jazz band.  This collection is one of the best available showing the many moods and persoalities of the Man With The Horn.  \nFor those who thought Harry played to the more commercial sensibilities of the audience one need only listen to his sensitive and plaintiff rendition of &quot;Lover Man&quot;.  That cut alone is worth the price of the album.  Add to that some of the best most swinging versions of &quot;Blues Like&quot; and &quot;The Jazz Connoisseur&quot;.  It's easy to see why Harry James' career was so long and successful and his recordings remain in demand.  ~ Dick Bobnick &quot;toughreviewer&quot;\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 55 - Harry James Tracks:\n01  I Surrender Dear 3:04 \n02  WalkinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 4:22 \n03  Eyes 4:13 \n04  Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?) 3:23 \n05  The Truth 3:06 \n06  End Of Town Blues 3:02 \n07  Hommage A Sweet Pea 5:15 \n08  Cornet Chop Suey 2:44 \n09  If I Could Be With You 2:38 \n10  Frenesi 2:06 \n11  Blues Like 4:17 \n12  The Jazz Connisseur 3:34 \n13  Sophisticated Lady 2:27 \n14  A Swinging Serenade 3:25 \n15  Rosebud 3:50 \n16  Mister Johnson 2:53 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87e4d39150f9623b9ba8604fa03bb668e02e838a","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+55+-+Harry+James+%281996%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+256-320%5D%5Bh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87e4d39150f9623b9ba8604fa03bb668e02e838a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,228,211,145,80,249,98,59,155,168,96,79,160,59,182,104,224,46,131,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
