Happily married but childless, Leila and Reza are pressured by Reza's mother to keep the family name alive. When Reza refuses to take a second wife the mother-in-law goes to work on Leila, wearing down her resistance with a mix of pleading, haranguing and outright lies, until the couple reluctantly gives in.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116851/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116851/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDuration: 1h 59mn \nDimensions: 704x400 \nFramerate: 25 fps \nCodec: X264 @ 817 Kbps \nAudio: AAC LC \nExtras: Chapters, cover \nNote: The extras are contained in the MKV file.\n\nLanguage: Farsi\nSubtitles: in mkv: Arabic, English, Farsi, French; srt: English and Portuguese (by Lu Stoker)\n\nThanks to CLeTuS @ KG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20b8083ec15259ec29ae1980637b70360bc5e226","amp;dn":"Leila+%28Dariush+Mehrjui%2C+1998%29+DVDRip.X264.AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20b8083ec15259ec29ae1980637b70360bc5e226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,184,8,62,193,82,89,236,41,174,25,128,99,123,112,54,11,197,226,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
