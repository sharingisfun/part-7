An alert and creative opportunist, he makes sure that no kindness shown to him, however small, will go unexploited for financial gain. The book contains ten short stories relating the adventures of Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge, narrated by Ukridge's long-suffering friend, the writer &quot;Corky&quot; Corcoran..\n\nRead by Jonathan Cecil.\n\nThe way the torrent files are split is not the same as the way the CDs begin and end, this is because i had the book in a single file of about 8hours but then decided to split it again so it is more manageable in my mp3 player. There might be another small file corresponding to each mp3 that should be the Sound Forge program i used to do the splitting. They are not necessary to the audiobook but were included by my hastiness in the directory therefore became part of the torrent. I have proof listened to the audiobook and its all there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a3fa4f9f4e137e6c6e596a7d4542a9d4e889f86","amp;dn":"P.+G.+Wodehouse-+Ukridge+%28read+by+Jonathan+Cecil%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a3fa4f9f4e137e6c6e596a7d4542a9d4e889f86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,63,164,249,244,225,55,230,198,229,150,167,212,84,42,157,78,136,159,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
