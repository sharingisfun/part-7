A reformation was enacted in 2007 without one of its original members, drummer Ken Owen, due to health reasons.\n\nAlthough widely regarded as pioneers of the grindcore genre, their early work was also tagged as splatter death metal, hardgore, and goregrind; on account of their morbid lyrics and gruesome album covers. However, they also became one of the pioneers in the subgenre known as melodic death metal with their 1993 album Heartwork.\n\nReformation (2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nIn June 2006, in an interview with Walker, he discussed the possibility of reforming Carcass, but mentioned that it was unlikely that Owen would participate, since he could not replicate his former drumming proficiency due to the effects of the cerebral hemorrhage he suffered in 1999.\nIn September 2007, it was announced by Michael Amott that he was rehearsing with Bill Steer, Jeff Walker and Daniel Erlandsson (replacing Ken Owen) in secret to rehearse old Carcass songs for a possible reunion tour. The original plans were to play at several festivals during the summer, but they couldn't meet the deadlines.\n\nIn October 2007, Carcass were confirmed to play at German heavy metal festival Wacken Open Air and Finland's Tuska Open Air Metal Festival in 2008. Carcass later embarked on a reunion tour, beginning on 6 June 2008. Carcass also played at Hellfest Summer Open Air, Metalcamp and several other festivals. The band toured Australia and New Zealand in 2008, and then in North America during September and October 2008, followed by the band's first South American tour, playing in Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Brazil.\n\nOn 15 November 2008, Carcass headlined the Danish Metal Awards held in Amager Bio, Copenhagen, Denmark. This was the only chance for fans to see Carcass in Denmark, since Denmark was not part of the official tour in 2008. Steer also presented the award for Best Danish Debut Album, which went to SCAMP for Mirror Faced Mentality. Carcass surprised the audience by bringing Ken Owen to the stage where he gave a brief drum solo to show how far he had come in recovering from his illness. Carcass performed an exclusive UK show at the Damnation Festival in Leeds; Walker hinted at the time that the Damnation performance may have been their last show ever. It was the first time Carcass had played in England in 14 years.\n\nCarcass re-released their entire back catalogue with bonus material during 2008 on Earache Records.\n\nCarcass continued to play live in 2009, with a North American tour completed in March 2009. Carcass also headlined the Bloodstock Open Air in Derbyshire, England in August 2009.\n\nIn August 2010, Carcass headlined Vagos Open Air in Vagos, Portugal, and Jalometalli Metal Music Festival held in Oulu, Finland. At Hellfest 2010, they performed the Necroticism album in its entirety. Carcass performed at the Chilean music festival Metalfest in April 2013 and the Maryland Deathfest XI music festival in May 2013. In 2012, Amott and Erlandsson left Carcass to focus on Arch Enemy.\n\nCarcass have recorded a new album, Surgical Steel, which is due for release in late 2013.  Walker announced that Daniel Wilding of Bristol-based deathgrind band Trigger the Bloodshed would be performing drums on the new album. Ben Ash of Pig Iron, Desolation, and Liquefied Skeleton joined the band in March 2013 on guitar. Carcass signed with Nuclear Blast on 23 May 2013, who will release Surgical Steel.\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nJeff Walker Bass\nBill Steer Guitar, Vocals\nDaniel Wilding Drums\nBen Ash Guitars\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nReek Of Putrefaction (1988)\nSymphonies Of Sickness (1989)\nNecroticism - Desencanting The Insalubrious (1991)\nHeartwork (1993)\nSwansong (1996)\nSurgical Steel (2013)\n\n\n\nSurgical Remission / Surplus Steel (2014) (EP)\n\n\n\n1.
