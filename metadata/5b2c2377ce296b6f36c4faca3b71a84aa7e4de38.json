Each issue offers a look at characters we know in situations they might never really face. Each story takes place in a separate reality that doesn't affect the central continuity, so there are no rules and no limits. Characters can die--and often do.\n\n\nCredit to Scanners!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b2c2377ce296b6f36c4faca3b71a84aa7e4de38","amp;dn":"What+If%3F+Collection+%281977-2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b2c2377ce296b6f36c4faca3b71a84aa7e4de38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,44,35,119,206,41,107,111,54,196,250,202,59,113,168,74,167,228,222,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
