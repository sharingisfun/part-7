You may have already seen me as an actor on an HBO show called Flight of the Conchords or selling barbeques in a shop in Christchurch, but if you haven't seen my stand-up then this will be a real treat. This &quot;Imagine That!&quot; show was recorded, with lots of cameras, at the El Rey theatre in Los Angeles. I touch all the hard hitting subjects like jetpacks, ejector seats, mermaids, bumper boats and the political situation in Darfur (all presented with intense new post millennium mime and self generated sound effects). It was a great night. Nearly everyone I emailed turned up and it was the best comedy show some of them had ever seen. Now it's your chance to watch it and soon you too will be the popular one at the party that does impressions of helicopters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aca3257ccf931000e1758aeabc9ea8442d6a5c52","amp;dn":"Rhys+Darby+Live+-+Imagine+That%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aca3257ccf931000e1758aeabc9ea8442d6a5c52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,163,37,124,207,147,16,0,225,117,138,234,188,158,168,68,45,106,92,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
