Featuring some of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-known companies, they illustrate how these two forces canÃ¢â‚¬â€and doÃ¢â‚¬â€work most powerfully to create value for all stakeholders: including customers, employees, suppliers, investors, society, and the environment.\n\nThese Ã¢â‚¬Å“Conscious CapitalismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ companies include Whole Foods Market, Southwest Airlines, Costco, Google, Patagonia, The Container Store, UPS, and dozens of others. We know them; we buy their products or use their services. Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to better understand how these organizations use four specific tenetsÃ¢â‚¬â€higher purpose, stakeholder integration, conscious leadership, and conscious culture and managementÃ¢â‚¬â€to build strong businesses and help advance capitalism further toward realizing its highest potential.\n\nAs leaders of the Conscious Capitalism movement, Mackey and Sisodia argue that aspiring leaders and business builders need to continue on this path of transformationÃ¢â‚¬â€for the good of both business and society as a whole.\n\nAt once a bold defense and reimagining of capitalism and a blueprint for a new system for doing business grounded in a more evolved ethical consciousness, this book provides a new lens for individuals and companies looking to build a more cooperative, humane, and positive future.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3e05f5abdcfebb440576653029641010830b528","amp;dn":"Conscious+Capitalism-+Mackey+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3e05f5abdcfebb440576653029641010830b528","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,224,95,90,189,207,235,180,64,87,102,83,2,150,65,1,8,48,181,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
