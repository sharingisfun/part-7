However, the sextet looks to take one step closer in becoming Ã¢â‚¬Å“the 21st century voice of that great musical city,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ according to a press release, with the March 13th release of their ATO Records debut, Women &amp; Work.\n\nThe album collects 11 original cuts that Ã¢â‚¬Å“range from barroom brawlers to lonesome laments, and cut deeper than anything else in the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extensive catalog.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ [sic] Women &amp; Work sees the band joined once more by a duo of legendary horn players, Scott Thompson (Cat Power, Al Green) and Jim Spake (Solomon Burke, Ray Charles). Also re-teaming with Lucero for the new effort is producer Ted Hutt, who has logged time for The Gaslight Anthem and Flogging Molly, among others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4354c0d68f3da1b1b100205f284a8eb67509a2b8","amp;dn":"Lucero+-+Women+%26amp%3B+Work+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4354c0d68f3da1b1b100205f284a8eb67509a2b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,84,192,214,143,61,161,177,177,0,32,95,40,74,142,182,117,9,162,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
