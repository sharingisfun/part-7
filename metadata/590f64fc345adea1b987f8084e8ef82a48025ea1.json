After the band's second album, 1991's Nevermind, nothing was ever quite the same, for better and for worse. Nirvana popularized punk, post-punk, and indie rock, unintentionally bringing it into the American mainstream like no other band to date. While their sound was equal parts Black Sabbath (as learned by fellow Washington underground rockers the Melvins) and Cheap Trick, Nirvana's aesthetics were strictly indie rock. They covered Vaselines songs, they revived new wave cuts by Devo, and leader Kurt Cobain relentlessly pushed his favorite bands -- whether it was the art punk of the Raincoats or the country-fried hardcore of the Meat Puppets -- as if his favorite records were always more important than his own music. While Nirvana's ideology was indie rock and their melodies were pop, the sonic rush of their records and live shows merged the post-industrial white noise with heavy metal grind. And that's what made the group an unprecedented multi-platinum sensation.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.You Know You're Right\n02.Smells Like Teen Spirit\n03.Sliver\n04.Lithium\n05.Heart-Shaped Box\n06.About A Girl\n07.Come As You Are\n08.Been A Son\n09.In Bloom\n10.Rape Me\n11.School\n12.All Apologies\n13.On A Plain\n14.Pennyroyal Tea\n15.Polly\n16.Dumb\n17.Sappy\n18.Aneurysm\n19.Molly's Lips\n20.Pay To Play\n21.Even In His Youth\n22.Marigold\n23.Where Did You Sleep Last Night\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Breed\n02.Serve The Servants\n03.Drain You\n04.Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\n05.The Man Who Sold The World\n06.Stay Away\n07.Stain\n08.Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\n09.Lounge Act\n10.Lake Of Fire\n11.I Hate Myself And I Want To Die\n12.Something In The Way\n13.Dive\n14.Oh The Guilt\n15.Blew\n16.Scentless Apprentice\n17.Son Of A Gun\n18.Spank Thru\n19.Love Buzz\n20.Very Ape\n21.Downer\n22.Milk It\n23.Old Age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
