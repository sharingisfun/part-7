However, MCQ items\nhave been criticized mostly for their lack of relevance\nto the core or essential learning objectives, because\nthey mostly tend to emphasize on the rare or the\nunusual. It is therefore of utmost importance to induct\nMCQ items which test knowledge, understanding and\napplication ability of the student in relevant areas.\nThis book attempts to introduce a series of MCQs in\nPharmacology and Therapeutics in topics which cover\nimportant learning objectives.\nMCQs are also an important method of self study\nand self assessment. An overwhelming amount of\ndetailed information about an ever increasing number\nof drugs is now available. A mental exercise in the\nconsiderations that underlie choice of one drug over\nthe other in specific situations has to be practised.\nSolving MCQs could help crystallization and assimilation\nof the fundamental Pharmacological principles\nas well as factual information about drugs needed for\ntheir safe and effective use. This purpose is best served\nif the MCQs relate to the text that the student has been\nusing for study.\nWith the above objectives, a MCQs book based on\nthe 3rd edition of the textbook Ã¢â‚¬ËœEssentials of Medical\nPharmacologyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ written by me was published in 1996.\nThis was enlarged and improved in the year 2000\nbased on the 4th edition of the textbook. The success\nof the earlier two editions of the MCQs book in achieving\nits objectives has encouraged undertaking a similar\nendeavour based on the revised and updated 5th\nedition (2003) of the textbook. In preparing this edition,\nall earlier MCQ items were reconsidered in the light of\nnew knowledge as well as changed therapeutic scenario,\nand suitably modified/improved or deleted. About 300\nnew MCQ items have been added. However, all items\nare of the most popular 'one best response' type and\nthe format has not been changed. The MCQs are\nnumbered chapterwise and the page number of the\nbook which provides answer to the subject matter of\nthe MCQ item is given after each item for quick\nreference. It is advised that after studying a chapter,\nthe student answers the MCQs and then finds out for\nhimself what all he has learnt correctly, what he\nmissed, and what has been understood incorrectly.\nUsed in this manner the present book will facilitate\nacquisition of relevant and clear-cut knowledge about\ndrugs.\n\nCopyright to the respective owners.If you like this book then please buy it.\nSharing is caring,Seed this torrent so others could enjoy it too.\nAny requests/suggestions can be made in the comments section or via email to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7b160e131a16161a1f550c1a0a1a09551a19191a083b17120d1e55181416&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nThanks\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4b1d396c8959af6755de2bd2be26e12f33f684c","amp;dn":"%5BKD+Tripathi%5D+MCQ%27s+in+Pharmacology.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4b1d396c8959af6755de2bd2be26e12f33f684c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,177,211,150,200,149,154,246,117,93,226,189,43,226,110,18,243,63,104,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
