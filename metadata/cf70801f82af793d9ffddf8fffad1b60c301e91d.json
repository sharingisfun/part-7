Luckily a few awesome guys at MDL worked out\nthe decryption process and made up a script with a few options.\n\nInstructions:\n1) extract the 7z file to same directory as esd file\n2) run admin command prompt and navigate to the directory\n3) run decrypt esdfilename\n\nThere's not really any benefit to using wim file over esd file unless\nyou need to modify the installation. ESD file is faster and smaller.\nWIM file is mountable, but larger.\n\nCredits: qad, nosferati87, abbodi1406, murphy78","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf70801f82af793d9ffddf8fffad1b60c301e91d","amp;dn":"Windows+8.1+with+Update+%28Core+Single+Language%29+%28x64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf70801f82af793d9ffddf8fffad1b60c301e91d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,112,128,31,130,175,121,61,159,253,223,143,255,173,27,96,195,1,233,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
