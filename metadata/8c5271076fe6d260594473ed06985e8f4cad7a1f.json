I would have compressed it more but momentarily lacked the software.  \n\nI haven\\&amp;#039;t listened to all of it yet, but it gets excellent reviews on amazon and is written by a rather famous biographer, Walter Isaacson.  Narration by Ed Hermann is good.  \n\nFrom the cover it seems that this book looks knowledgably at his scientific achievements as well as his personal life.  The author had access to many more of Einstein\\&amp;#039;s personal papers than previous biographers.  \n\nLet me know what you think.  It\\&amp;#039;s on my to read list, but I post it now before returning it to the owner.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Einstein-Life-Universe-Walter-Isaacson/dp/0743560965/ref=ed_oe_a&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Einstein-Life-Universe-Walter-Isaacson/dp/0743560965/ref=ed_oe_a&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c5271076fe6d260594473ed06985e8f4cad7a1f","amp;dn":"Einstein+-+Isaacson%2C+Walter+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c5271076fe6d260594473ed06985e8f4cad7a1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,82,113,7,111,230,210,96,89,68,115,237,6,152,94,143,76,173,122,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
