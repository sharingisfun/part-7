Skyrim Realistic Overhaul is not a overhaul like Skyrim Redone, but is rather a comprehensive texture pack for Skyrim (like Skyrim HD or Serious HD, but with an aim towards vanilla friendliness and realism)\n\nWithout a doubt, this is one of, if not oughtright, the best texture packs ever relased for Skyrim. It used to be on the Nexus, but a complicated situation caused it to be taken down.\n \nBoth the extra Dawnguard textures and the 1.6 update are included in this torrent. The 4k mountain textures are not included (but I don't see a reason to - 4k is very big)\n\nThis is the 1k sized version of Skyrim Realistic Overhaul. Recommended for users with lower VRAM or with users of multiple big texture packs.\n\nInstallation: just add the files manually in your favorite mod manager and activate them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:242440e4e89f188886a1c56c1ab7bf3a54c39e1b","amp;dn":"Skyrim+Realistic+Overhaul+-+1024K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"242440e4e89f188886a1c56c1ab7bf3a54c39e1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,36,64,228,232,159,24,136,134,161,197,108,26,183,191,58,84,195,158,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
