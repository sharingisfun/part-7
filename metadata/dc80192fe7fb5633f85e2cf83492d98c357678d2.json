Make use of the tools offered to empower yourself and feel free to offer to as many as you can, as producing peaceful, joyful and loving humans is the most important task of all. A world full of love, light and laughter, let us make it happen.\n\n==What is Isha Kriya?==\n\nToday, for most people, the word ÃƒÂ¬YogaÃƒÂ® usually conjures up images of twisting the body into impossible postures. The physical aspect of Yoga is only one facet of this multi-dimensional science. Yoga is a technology to bring the body and mind to the peak of their capabilities ÃƒÂ± allowing one to live life to the fullest.\n\nIt is the vision of Sadhguru ÃƒÂ± a realized yogi and Master ÃƒÂ± to offer ÃƒÂ«one drop of spiritualityÃƒÂ­ to every individual. Through Isha Kriya, the possibilities of a spiritual process, which were once available only to yogis and ascetics, are now being offered to every human being in the comfort of their own home.\nRooted in the timeless wisdom of the yogic sciences, Isha Kriya is a simple yet potent practice created by Sadhguru. ÃƒÂ¬IshaÃƒÂ® refers to that which is the source of creation; ÃƒÂ¬kriyaÃƒÂ® literally means ÃƒÂ¬internal action.ÃƒÂ® The purpose of Isha Kriya is to help an individual get in touch with the source of his existence, to create life according to his own wish and vision. Daily practice of Isha Kriya brings health, dynamism, peace and wellbeing. It is a powerful tool to cope with the hectic pace of modern life.\nIsha Kriya is free, simple, and easy to practice. Available as a guided meditation with an instructional video and downloadable instructions, it has the potential to transform the life of anyone who is willing to invest just a few minutes a day.\n\n\n==About Sadhguru==\n\nSadhguru, a yogi, mystic, poet and visionary humanitarian, is a spiritual master with a difference. His life and work are a possibility for each individual to experience the peace and joy that pervades the core of every human being. It is SadhguruÃƒÂ­s vision that every one receives ÃƒÂ«one-drop of spirituality', allowing them to transform their lives and take their destiny into their hands.\n\nVisit Sadhguru.org\nVisit IshaFoundation.org\n\n==What people are saying about Isha Kriya==\n\n&quot;Thanks, Sadhguru, for helping me. I took the Inner Engineering course last July in Florida and came away settled and at peace. But after a knee replacement surgery in December, my whole body and my mind has been so difficult to deal with. Just listening to the Isha Kriya has made it possible to feel that same peace again.&quot;\nÃƒÂ± Gill Jones, USA\nÃƒÂ¬I just practiced the Isha Kriya meditation and was surprised how powerful this meditation with Sadhguru is ÃƒÂ± even through an online video! I certainly felt a sense of inner peace, balance and a separation from attachment.&quot; \nÃƒÂ± Olga Avila, Holland\n\n==Downloads==\n\nDVD ISO IMAGE: http://downloads.ishafoundation.org/Isha-Kriya/video/Technologies-For-Wellbeing-IshaKriya.com-Isha-Foundation-DVD.iso\nFull Video: http://downloads.ishafoundation.org/Isha-Kriya/video/Technologies-for-Wellbeing-Ishakriya.com-Intro-Meditation-Computer.mp4\nMeditation: http://downloads.ishafoundation.org/Isha-Kriya/video/Technologies-for-Wellbeing-Ishakriya.com-Meditation-Only-Computer.mp4\n_____________________\nÃ‚Â©Isha Foundation 2014\nUploaded by Isha Voulenteer Nishchay\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc80192fe7fb5633f85e2cf83492d98c357678d2","amp;dn":"Isha+Kriya+%28Guided+Meditation%29+by+Sadhguru","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc80192fe7fb5633f85e2cf83492d98c357678d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,128,25,47,231,251,86,51,248,94,44,248,52,146,217,140,53,118,120,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
