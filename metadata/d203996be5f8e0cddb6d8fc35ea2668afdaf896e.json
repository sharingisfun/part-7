Eisenstein\nYear: 1958\nLanguage: Russian\nSubtitles: English\n\nRuntime: 01:24:52 \nVideo Codec: DivX 3 Low-Motion\nVideo Bitrate: 1059 kbps\nResolution: 512x384 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\nFPS: 25.000\nAudio:  MPEG-1 Layer 3 81kb/s\n\nThis second part of Eisenstein's history of the reign of &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; is an excellent portrayal of the complex machinations between the famous tsar and his determined rivals, the boyars. The story, the settings, the actors, and the characters surpass even the high standards of Part One. Nikolai Cherkasov is again excellent in his portrayal of Ivan, with even his occasional exaggerations fitting nicely into his memorable characterization of the formidable tsar. Serafima Birman is again quite effective as Ivan's aunt and most bitter rival. As Vladimir, Pavel Kadochnikov gets much more to do than he did in Part One, and he makes good use of his scenes. The character of Vladimir - foolish and timid, but with ambition in his heart - is important to the way that events play out.\n\nSergei Eisenstein's saga of Czar Ivan IV continues with the struggle for power and the use of secret police, a controversial segment that caused the film to be banned by Stalin in 1946 (the film was not released until 1958). The predominantly black-and-white film features a banquet dance sequence in color. Obviously the two parts must be viewed as a whole to be fully appreciated. Many film historians consider this period in Eisenstein's career less interesting than his silent period because of a sentimental return to archaic forms (characteristic of Soviet society in the '30s and '40s). Perhaps it was just part of his maturity.\n\nThis movie had english subs hardcoded. Enjoy another Eisenstein masterpiece! :)\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, these torrents will NEVER DIE'\n\nSimply search for 'freakyflicks' \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d203996be5f8e0cddb6d8fc35ea2668afdaf896e","amp;dn":"Ivan+the+Terrible%3A+Part+II+%28Sergei+M.+Eisenstein%2C+1958%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d203996be5f8e0cddb6d8fc35ea2668afdaf896e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,3,153,107,229,248,224,205,219,109,143,195,94,162,102,138,253,175,137,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
