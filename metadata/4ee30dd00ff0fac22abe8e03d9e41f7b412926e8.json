It is a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide, affecting millions of people. The illness is complex and dynamic, so that many individuals are misdiagnosed for years and clinicians struggle with identifying the most appropriate and successful treatment. Because it is complex and common, people suffering from bipolar disorder seek help from clinicians of all types - from psychiatrists, family doctors, gynecologists, and internists to psychologists, social workers and other therapists. For clinicians without significant experience with bipolar disorder, how to manage the condition can be mystifying. Even experienced psychiatrists will frequently find themselves uncertain of the best approach to a given individual with bipolar illness. This pocket-sized guide was specifically written with this diverse group of clinicians in mind. It provides a concise, practical and current overview of bipolar disorder, including making a correct diagnosis, identifying important medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and describing our current understanding of the epidemiology, genetics and neurobiology of the condition. In addition to these topics to provide context, the majority of the book is focused on a programmatic approach toward managing bipolar disorder, including discussions of specific subpopulations, such as children or women who are pregnant. The book may also be of interest for people with bipolar disorder and their families, to help guide treatment seeking and provide education about this sometimes mystifying condition. The author is an internationally recognized and trusted expert in the study and treatment of bipolar disorder, annually named a Best DoctorÃ‚Â® and recognized by US News and World ReportÃ‚Â® as a Top 1% Psychiatrist, whose own extensive clinical experience working with people with bipolar disorder guides this book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ee30dd00ff0fac22abe8e03d9e41f7b412926e8","amp;dn":"Bipolar+Disorder+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ee30dd00ff0fac22abe8e03d9e41f7b412926e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,227,13,208,15,240,250,194,42,190,142,3,217,228,31,123,65,41,38,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
