The establishments he has loved have not only influenced culinary trends at home and abroad, but represent the changing history and culture of food in America and Western Europe. From his usual table, he has watched the growth of Nouvelle Cuisine and fusion cuisine; the organic and locavore movements; nose-to-tail eating; and so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“molecular gastronomy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn My Usual Table, Andrews interweaves his own storyÃ¢â‚¬â€from growing up in the sunset years of HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s golden age to traveling the world in pursuit of great foodÃ¢â‚¬â€with tales of the restaurants, chefs, and restaurateurs who are emblematic of the revolutions great and small that have forever changed the way we eat, cook, and think about food","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb9864f2acae06fa73ec4eab63025bb644ee5159","amp;dn":"My+Usual+Table%3AA+Life+in+Restaurants%5BMyeBookShelf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb9864f2acae06fa73ec4eab63025bb644ee5159","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,152,100,242,172,174,6,250,115,236,78,171,99,2,91,182,68,238,81,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
