And because simulation has its place in many different parts of finance, this well-rounded resource takes you step by step through the process of creating multiple, smaller modelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½using MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® ExcelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and VBAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as opposed to a single unified model.\n\nEach section begins with a discussion of theoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with enough background and mathematical formulas provided to reinforce the concept coveredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and then moves on to a Model Builder exercise where the theory is transferred to an application in MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® ExcelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®. Along the way, this accessible guide:\n\nWorks through random number generation, explains Brownian motion, and explores correlation between variables with specific examples\n\nTakes you through simulating interest rate paths to price bonds\n\nCreates a corporate default simulation based on structural and reduced form models\n\nProvides a thorough look at simulating pools of assets\n\nAddresses data deficiencies and how to manage data as it relates to a simulation\n\nComplete with a companion website that contains information including Model Builder files, this book is an essential guideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for both seasoned professionals and those new to the world of financial simulation modelingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to understanding the intricacies of this discipline and excelling at it.
