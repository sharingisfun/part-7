While there are numerous collections featuring the Native music of North America, this is one of the first to bring together indigenous artists from North, Central and South America. \nThis compilation celebrates both the diversity and richness of Native American cultures. It revels in their similarities as well as their differences. It is not a comprehensive overview of the indigenous music of the Americas, nor is it a collection of traditional music. With a few exceptions, the artists featured here represent new trends in Native music. Most of the music on this collection reflects the way in which indigenous peoples incorporate the music around them from the predominant culture and, by blending in elements of their tradition, make it their own. The main goal of this compilation, as with all Putumayo World Music recordings, is to present a selection of great music which will hopefully entertain, surprise, and inspire you to explore even further. \n\nKashtin - Akua Tuta \nTudjaat - Qiugauiit \nAndrew Vasquez - Wind River \nBill Miller - Ghost Dance \nBurning Sky - Native Funk \nJerry Alfred &amp; the Medicine Beat - Nendaa - Go Back \nJaramar - La Tortuga \nBinni Gula&amp;#039;za - Ni&amp;#039;bixi Dxi Zina \nMarlui Miranda - Araruna \nRegional Vermelho e Branco - Vale do Javari \nLos Incas - Tema de Maimara \nBolivia Manta - Chayantenita \nExpresiÃƒÂ³n - Ollantay \n\n\nThis is one of the many PutumayoÃ‚Â´s records I have in mind to upload, so please help keep seeding after you downloaded.\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f938cc5816e8fe89dd1a517e22581a460a49068","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Presents+-+A+Native+American+Odyssey+by+Ulysses56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f938cc5816e8fe89dd1a517e22581a460a49068","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,147,140,197,129,110,143,232,157,209,165,23,226,37,129,164,96,164,144,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
