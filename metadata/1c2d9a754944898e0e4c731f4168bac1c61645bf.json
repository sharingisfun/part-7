Vilar's perceptive and often very funny look at the battle between the sexes has earned her death threats from Radical Feminists. But Vilar's intention is not misogynous: she maintains that only if women and men look at their place in society with honesty, will there be any hope for change.\n\nFile Under:\nMGTOW, Men's Rights,mens rights, MRA, FRA, anti-feminism, feminism, mra, fra, Father's Rights, fathers rights, misandry, anti-misandry\n\nThe Essential Men's Right's Library - Torrent #2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c2d9a754944898e0e4c731f4168bac1c61645bf","amp;dn":"Sex+-+Esther+Vilar+-+The+Manipulated+Man.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c2d9a754944898e0e4c731f4168bac1c61645bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,45,154,117,73,68,137,142,14,76,115,31,65,104,186,193,198,22,69,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
