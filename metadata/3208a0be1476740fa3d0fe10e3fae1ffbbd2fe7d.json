There, the rootstock of humanity survived, eking out an existence in hellzones and hounded by black-armored Magistrates, the enforcers of the baronsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ laws.\nWhen Cobaltville Magistrates Kane and Grant came across a piece of misplaced technology and Brigid Baptiste, an archivist began an investigation on their behalf, they found themselves branded as sedititionists, their citizenship stripped from them and they were reclassified as Outlanders.\nSince 1997Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Exile To Hell, the first book in the series, the heroes and heroines of Outlanders slowly uncovered the truth behind the barons, the Archons and the nuclear holocaust and finally the hidden history of humanity.\nThey learn that Earth and humankind has been influenced since the dawn of time by the reptilian Anunnaki and the Tuatha DÃƒÂ© Danann. They realize that the baronies are a revival of the god-king system of ancient Sumeria.\nBesides the nine barons, other threats arise in the early books, namely Sindri, a brilliant but deranged dwarf who rules a secret colony on Mars. First appearing in Parallax Red (1998), Sindri becomes the most persistent foe of the Cerberus warriors, appearing in several novels.\nOther recurring enemies include Colonel Thrush, Sam the Imperator, Grigori Zakat and Maccan, the last prince of the Tuatha DÃƒÂ© Danann.\nIn Shadow Scourge (2000), the heroes contend with Ocajinik, apparently one of H. P. LovecraftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Old Ones.\nIn Children of the Serpent (2005), the Cerberus warriors discover that the nuclear holocaust and the institution of the baronies were part of an ancient plan formulated over a thousand years before by Enlil, the last Anunnaki on Earth in order to reincarnate the pantheon of Sumerian gods and re-establish their rule over the world.\nThe reincarnated Enlil becomes the Outlanders main villain. He is considerably more evil and powerful than any of the barons, and has much of the knowledge and technology of the Anunnaki.\nEmploying conspiracy theories and myths from all cultures as underpinnings, Outlanders quickly distanced itself from the survivalist tone of Deathlands and struck out in new directions, providing explanations and a backstory for many of the unresolved science-fiction elements in the earlier series.\nMiscellania\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3208a0be1476740fa3d0fe10e3fae1ffbbd2fe7d","amp;dn":"James+Axler+-+Outlanders+30+%7E+40+%28Graphic+Audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3208a0be1476740fa3d0fe10e3fae1ffbbd2fe7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,8,160,190,20,118,116,15,163,208,254,16,227,250,225,255,187,210,254,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
