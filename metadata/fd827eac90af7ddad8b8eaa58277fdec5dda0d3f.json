He is a great cross of country and rocker, perhaps a cowboy rocker, with a brand and style of music that gets you energized while also perhaps smacking you in the gut a bit.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Tattoos on this town                                 [03:23]\n02.Dirt road anthem                                     [03:49]\n03.Church pew or bar stool                              [04:19]\n04.Just passing through                                 [03:20]\n05.Fly over states                                      [03:38]\n06.My kinda party                                       [04:45]\n07.I ain't ready to quit                                [03:34]\n08.It ain't easy                                        [03:02]\n09.Country boy's world                                  [04:07]\n10.The heartache that don't stop hurting                [03:55]\n11.Texas was you                                        [03:25]\n12.Don't you wanna stay (with kelly clarkson)           [04:16]\n13.See you when I see you                               [03:48]\n14.If she could see me now                              [03:30]\n15.Days like these                                      [03:59]\n____\n\n56:50 min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd827eac90af7ddad8b8eaa58277fdec5dda0d3f","amp;dn":"Jason_Aldean-My_Kinda_Party-%28Retail%29-2010-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd827eac90af7ddad8b8eaa58277fdec5dda0d3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,130,126,172,144,175,125,218,216,184,234,165,130,119,253,236,93,218,13,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
