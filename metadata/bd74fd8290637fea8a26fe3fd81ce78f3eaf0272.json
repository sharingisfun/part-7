He comes to police attention through normal procedures (he was the victim's client), but his outbursts make him the prime suspect of the clever Porfiry. Meanwhile, life swirls around Raskolnikov: his mother and sister come to the city followed by two older men seeking his sister's hand; he meets a drunken clerk who is then killed in a traffic accident, and he falls in love with the man's daughter, Sonia, a young prostitute. She urges him to confess, promising to follow him to Siberia. Will he accept responsibility?\n\nMade in 1970. Black and white. 3 hours and 28 minutes.\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064839/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd74fd8290637fea8a26fe3fd81ce78f3eaf0272","amp;dn":"Crime+and+Punishment+%281970%29+%5BfRoG-Xvid-DVDRip-Russian_with_Eng_S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd74fd8290637fea8a26fe3fd81ce78f3eaf0272","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,116,253,130,144,99,127,234,138,38,254,63,216,28,231,143,62,175,2,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
