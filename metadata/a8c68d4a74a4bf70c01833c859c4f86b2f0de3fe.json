Peter Earl &amp; Tim Wakeley&quot;\nPublisher: McGraw-Hill Education | 2005 | ISBN: 0077103920 | PDF | 592 pages | 2.78 MB\n\n&quot;Business Economics: A Contemporary Approach&quot; provides students with a practical and useful learning resource that is rooted firmly in a pragmatic and pluralist approach to economic analysis. Designed for both undergraduates and MBA students taking their first course in business economics, the text focuses on introducing students to the richness of economics as a framework for understanding business. It is structured around the changing sets of problems that decision-makers face, such as getting a firm started, keeping the firm in business despite growing competition, growing the firm and finally, rejuvenating the firm in the face of declining demand.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8c68d4a74a4bf70c01833c859c4f86b2f0de3fe","amp;dn":"Business+Economics%3A+A+Contemporary+Approach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8c68d4a74a4bf70c01833c859c4f86b2f0de3fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,198,141,74,116,164,191,112,192,24,51,200,89,196,248,107,47,13,227,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
