Good luck :) \n- Support for Japanese language \n- Lots of small bug fixes and improvements \n\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nOverview:\nWhistleblower starts the story that led to Outlast, and stretches past the events of the first game to show the true final chapter in the story of Mount Massive Asylum.\n\nOutlast: Whistleblower follows the story of Waylon Park, the software engineer under contract with the Murkoff Corporation who emails journalists around the world - including Miles Upshur - at the beginning of Outlast.\n\nYou'll meet Waylon a few weeks into his time at Mount Massive, during which he has been unable to even contact his wife and son thanks to strict security protocols. Having developed a deep-seated distrust of the profit-motivated scientists and doctors leading dangerous and irresponsible experiments on their patients, Waylon ends up setting events in motion that lead to the unmasking of Mount Massive's rotten core.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb4d0cf6330436a24eab0ea1915259a61392c851","amp;dn":"Outlast+%28Latest+Patch+With+Whistleblower+DLC%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb4d0cf6330436a24eab0ea1915259a61392c851","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,77,12,246,51,4,54,162,78,171,14,161,145,82,89,166,19,146,200,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
