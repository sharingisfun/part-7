Each hunting area is also complete with seasonal changes of the environments, such as leaves falling from the trees, as well as the daily changes of the sun rising and setting. Other extremely realistic environmental effects include fish swimming in lakes and rivers and animals roaming the hunting area. Gamers can also save their hunt at any time and pick up where they left off.\n\nAll hunting areas are created from USGS terrain data. The landscapes are accurately depicted in the game, based on their true environments. Accurate sounds and trees, including birds and vegetation indigenous to the areas, also make Deer Hunter 3 as realistic as it can get. &quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a398a1a1e91b29f62e00db48865ecb7973d92a2","amp;dn":"Deer+Hunter+3%3A+The+Legend+Continues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a398a1a1e91b29f62e00db48865ecb7973d92a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,57,138,26,30,145,178,159,98,224,13,180,136,101,236,183,151,61,146,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
