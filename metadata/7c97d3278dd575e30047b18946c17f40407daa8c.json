A major artistic breakthrough for Kinks' songwriter Ray Davies, the LP represents the first full flowering of Davies' use of narrative, observation, and wry social commentary in his songs. It heralded The Kinks' move away from the hard-driving rock and roll style of 1964-65, which had catapulted the group to international stardom. It was the first Kinks album consisting entirely of Ray Davies compositions, and was their first album recorded over several months, rather than in one concentrated session. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c97d3278dd575e30047b18946c17f40407daa8c","amp;dn":"The+Kinks+-+Face+to+Face+%281966%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c97d3278dd575e30047b18946c17f40407daa8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,151,211,39,141,213,117,227,0,71,177,137,70,193,127,64,64,125,170,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
