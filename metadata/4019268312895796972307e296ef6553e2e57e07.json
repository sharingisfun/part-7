Friedman speaks to America's urgent need for national renewal and explains how a green revolution can bring about both a sustainable environment and a sustainable America.\n\nFriedman explains how global warming, rapidly growing populations, and the expansion of the world's middle class through globalization have produced a dangerously unstable planet--one that is &quot;hot, flat, and crowded.&quot; In this Release 2.0 edition, he also shows how the very habits that led us to ravage the natural world led to the meltdown of the financial markets and the Great Recession. The challenge of a sustainable way of life presents the United States with an opportunity not only to rebuild its economy, but to lead the world in radically innovating toward cleaner energy. And it could inspire Americans to something we haven't seen in a long time--nation-building in America--by summoning the intelligence, creativity, and concern for the common good that are our greatest national resources. \n\n+++ utilize Calibre to handle the file however you want\n\n\n\n\nhe          l      i          i       aru        y     y     u     r    a i i  l e h","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4019268312895796972307e296ef6553e2e57e07","amp;dn":"Hot%2C+Flat%2C+and+Crowded+2.0+.+Thomas+L.+Friedman+.+ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4019268312895796972307e296ef6553e2e57e07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,25,38,131,18,137,87,150,151,35,7,226,150,239,101,83,226,229,126,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
