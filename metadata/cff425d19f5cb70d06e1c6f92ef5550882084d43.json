Featuring the talents of keyboardist Raphaelle Standell-Preston, guitarist Katie Lee, guitarist Taylor Smith, and drummer Austin Tufts, Braids originally started out as the Calgary-based band the Neighborhood Council. The four-piece released an EP before relocating to Montreal and changing its name. Braids released their debut full-length album, Native Speaker, in early 2011.\n\nReleased: 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie, Shoegaze\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\n Tracks:\n\n   1.
