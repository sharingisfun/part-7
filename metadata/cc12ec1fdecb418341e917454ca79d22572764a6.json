Just take a look at the first two pages, shown here in the previews. It only take TWO pages to define the character, AND the universe of Judge Dredd, and set the mood for the entire book. The book do NOT pull any punches, and is actually one of the few comics that can make me shed a tear when reading it.\n\n\nAmerica is a Judge Dredd story published in the Judge Dredd Megazine in 1990. Told in flashbacks, the story concerns the character America Jara, her friend Bennett Beeny and their tragic encounters with the Justice Department. As Bennett Beeny grows up to reap the benefits of Mega City One, becoming a famous singer and comedian, America becomes more and more disillusioned. She becomes a democracy activist and later a terrorist. The story is grounded in the conflict between the Democracy movement and Mega City One's fascist police state, and is one of the most political Judge Dredd stories ever told.\nWriter John Wagner (co-creator of Dredd) has said that America is his favourite Judge Dredd story, and editor David Bishop describes it as &quot;the best Judge Dredd story ever written.&quot;\n\nThis digital rip also include the sequels America II: Fading of the Light, and Cadet.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/u5O1wdG8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/u5O1wdG8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/t4IsDkkk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/t4IsDkkk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/SjxOaJUA.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/SjxOaJUA.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/FfBFzlAb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/FfBFzlAb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/9ZBXVUm0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/9ZBXVUm0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/LfjTo2k7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/LfjTo2k7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/4NBw9br6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/4NBw9br6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/ZL1Cawp7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/ZL1Cawp7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/6r7B2viy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/6r7B2viy.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc12ec1fdecb418341e917454ca79d22572764a6","amp;dn":"Judge+Dredd+-+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc12ec1fdecb418341e917454ca79d22572764a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,18,236,31,222,203,65,131,65,233,23,69,76,167,157,34,87,39,100,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
