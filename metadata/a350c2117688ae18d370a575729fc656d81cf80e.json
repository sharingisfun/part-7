The members are Kelvin Mercer (Posdnuos, Mercenary, Plug Wonder Why, Plug One), David Jude Jolicoeur (Trugoy the Dove, Dave, Plug Two) and Vincent Mason (P.A. Pasemaster Mase, Maseo, Plug Three). The three formed the group in high school and caught the attention of producer Paul Huston (Prince Paul) with a demo tape of the song &quot;Plug Tunin'.&quot; Prince Paul was also sometimes referred to as Plug Four. The Plug names are alleged to come from the numbers that each bandmate's microphone was labeled on the soundboard. Posdnuos was always plugged into plug one, Trugoy was plugged into plug two, and so forth.\nWith its playful wordplay, innovative sampling, and witty skits, the band's debut album, 3 Feet High and Rising, has been hailed as a hip-hop masterpiece. It is also the band's biggest commercial success to date, with their subsequent albums selling progressively less, despite receiving high praise from critics. A measure of 3 Feet High and Rising's cross-over appeal was the fact that it was voted Album of the Year by NME Magazine, a title better known for its taste in guitar-based music. De La Soul has influenced numerous other hip hop artists such as Camp Lo, The Black Eyed Peas, and Digable Planets.[citation needed] They were also influential in the early stages of rapper/actor Mos Def's career, and are a core part of the Spitkicker collective. They are the second longest standing Native Tongues Posse group, after the Jungle Brothers.\nIn 1996, they appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD, America is Dying Slowly, alongside Biz Markie, Wu-Tang Clan, and Fat Joe, among many other prominent hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as &quot;a masterpiece&quot; by The Source magazine.\nIn 2006, the group won a Grammy for their collaboration with Gorillaz on the single &quot;Feel Good Inc.&quot;[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Feet High And Rising 1989\n\n\n\n3 Feet High and Rising is the influential debut album from American hip hop trio De La Soul, released in 1989.\n\nThe album marked the first of three full-length collaborations with producer Prince Paul, which would become the critical and commercial peak of both parties. It's consistently placed on 'greatest albums' lists by noted music critics and publications.[4] Robert Christgau called the record &quot;unlike any rap album you or anybody else has ever heard.&quot;[5] In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source Magazine's 100 Best Rap Albums..[6]\n\nA critical, as well as commercial success, the album contains the well known singles, &quot;Me Myself and I&quot;, &quot;The Magic Number&quot;, &quot;Buddy&quot;, and &quot;Eye Know&quot;. On October 23, 2001, the album was re-issued along with an extra disc of B-side tracks, and alternative versions. The album's title was inspired by a line in the Johnny Cash song &quot;Five Feet High and Rising&quot;. The album is discussed in detail by De La Soul in Brian Coleman's book Check the Technique.[7]\n\nLyrically, the album was unusual for its time. Even beside its exhortations for peace and harmony, many of the songs are personal and heartfelt recountings of early sexual intercourse (&quot;Jenifa Taught Me&quot;), love (&quot;Eye Know&quot;) and insecurity regarding personal appearance and fashion (&quot;Can U Keep a Secret&quot;, &quot;A Little Bit of Soap&quot; &quot;Take It Off&quot;). With the exception of &quot;Do As De La Does&quot;, there is very little profanity on the album, in contrast to most hip hop albums from the time period. Many of the lyrics are humorous and/or abstract, being both inventive and original; Posdnous compares the rhymes to dance in &quot;The Magic Number&quot; (&quot;the phrasing Fred Astaires&quot;). Many of the listeners who compared the group to hippies criticized the album for a childlike, simple approach at complex issues, as on &quot;Tread Water&quot;, where a series of animals exhort the listener to maintain a positive mental attitude. Supporters point to songs like &quot;Say No Go&quot; as a realistic portrayal of the pitfalls of drug abuse. The title, besides being a Hall &amp; Oates sample, is a reference to Nancy Reagan's &quot;Just Say No&quot; campaign; Posdnous criticizes Reagan, but applauds the sentiment.\n\nThe first track, entitled &quot;Intro&quot;, is a skit that takes place at a game show. The contestants (portrayed by the three members of De La Soul plus producer Prince Paul) are asked four questions by the host (Al Watts), and their attempts at answering are scattered about the album. The song &quot;Ghetto Thang&quot; is one of the few non-positive tracks on the album. It is a story about poverty and other social ills, even though De La Soul is from middle-class suburb Amityville, New York (on Long Island). Its denunciation of ghetto violence can be summed up in the words &quot;Ghetto gained a ghetto name from ghetto ways/Now there must be ghetto gangs and ghetto play/If ghetto thing can have its way and get arranged/Then there must be some ghetto love and ghetto change&quot;. &quot;Description&quot; describes each member of De La Soul, and a few others, in five lines each, the style reminiscent of a limerick.\n\nIt's also listed on Rolling Stones' 200 Essential Rock Records and The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums (both of which are unordered). When Village Voice held its annual Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll for 1989, 3 Feet High and Rising was ranked at #1, outdistancing its nearest opponent (Neil Young's Freedom) by 21 votes and 260 points. It was also listed on the Rolling Stones The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Released amid the 1989 boom in gangsta rap, which gravitated towards hardcore, confrontational, violent lyrics, De La Soul's uniquely positive style made them an oddity beginning with the first single, &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot;. Their positivity meant many observers labeled them a &quot;hippie&quot; group, based on their declaration of the &quot;D.A.I.S.Y. Age&quot; (da inner sound, y'all). Sampling artists as diverse as Johnny Cash, Hall &amp; Oates, Steely Dan and The Turtles, 3 Feet High and Rising is often viewed as the stylistic beginning of 1990s alternative hip hop (and especially jazz rap).[8]\n\n&quot;An inevitable development in the class history of rap, [De La Soul is] new wave to Public Enemy's punk,&quot; wrote critic Robert Christgau in his Consumer Guide column's review of 3 Feet High and Rising. &quot;Their music is also radically unlike any rap you or anybody else has ever heard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ inspirations include the Jarmels and a learn-it-yourself French record. And for all their kiddie consciousness, junk-culture arcana, and suburban in-jokes, they're in the new tradition ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ you can dance to them, which counts for plenty when disjunction is your problem.&quot;\n\nRolling Stone magazine gave the album three stars and concluded that it was &quot;(o)ne of the most original rap records ever to come down the pike, the inventive, playful 3 Feet High and Rising stands staid rap conventions on their def ear&quot;.\n\nIt was ranked 7 in Spin's &quot;100 Greatest Albums, 1985ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2005&quot;, ranked 88th in a 2005 survey held by British television's Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time. In 1998 , the album was selected as one of The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums. In 2003, the album was ranked number 346 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2006, Q magazine placed the album at #20 in its list of &quot;40 Best Albums of the '80s&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n01 - Intro\n02 - The Magic Number\n03 - Change In Speak\n04 - Cool Breeze On The Rocks\n05 - Can U Keep A Secret?\n06 - Jenifa Taught Me (Derwin's Revenge)\n07 - Ghetto Thang\n08 - Transmitting Live From Mars\n09 - Eye Know\n10 - Take It Off\n11 - A Little Bit Of Soap\n12 - Tread Water\n13 - Say No Go\n14 - Do As De La Does\n15 - Plug Tunin'\n16 - De La Orgee\n17 - Buddy\n18 - Description\n19 - Me, Myself And I\n20 - This A Recording 4 Living In A Full Time Era\n21 - I Can Do Anything\n22 - D.A.I.S.Y.
