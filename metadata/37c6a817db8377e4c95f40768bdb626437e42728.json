This performance was filmed during the Genoa Opera Company's historic tour of the People's Republic of China in 1986. World-renowned tenor Luciano Pavarotti sings the role of the poet Rodolfo, with Fiamma Izzo D'Amico performing the part of his tragic love interest, Mimi.\n\nLa bohÃƒÂ¨me is an opera in four acts, by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, based on ScÃƒÂ¨nes de la vie de bohÃƒÂ¨me by Henri Murger. The world premiere performance of La bohÃƒÂ¨me was in Turin on 1 February 1896 at the Teatro Regio and conducted by the young Arturo Toscanini. Since then, La bohÃƒÂ¨me has become part of the standard Italian opera repertory and is the fourth most frequently performed opera worldwide. In 1946, fifty years after the opera's premiere, Toscanini conducted a performance of it on radio with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. This performance was eventually released on records and on Compact Disc. It is the only recording of a Puccini opera by its original conductor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37c6a817db8377e4c95f40768bdb626437e42728","amp;dn":"Puccini+-+La+Boheme+-+Luciano+Pavaratti+%28Tianquiao+Theatre%29+1986","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37c6a817db8377e4c95f40768bdb626437e42728","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,198,168,23,219,131,119,228,201,95,64,118,139,219,98,100,55,228,39,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
