This powerful combination text and online video collection delivers coverage of every major cardiac topic and abnormality.\n\nThere are eighteen chapters that include questions followed by detailed discussion that answers the question, as well as illustrations and text supplemented by animations that can be opened with a QR code reader using a smartphone or a tablet with Internet access. An index of all videos and direct links to them online are also included. Multiple variations on a topic are often included to illustrate the full spectrum of the abnormality being discussed. Bedside findings and the electrocardiogram, an integral part of the practice of echocardiography, are incorporated into the discussion whenever possible.\n\nNumerous references are provided, with a strong emphasis on freely available full-text articles. These are identified by an open book icon indicating they are readable as PDFs. Other references point you to full-text cardiac physical diagnosis articles that will prove valuable at the bedside; some are annotated to further explain their value, and others were chosen for the comprehensive illustration of cardiac pathology as it relates to echocardiographic imaging. The book also includes references to classic echocardiography articles. Practical Bedside Echocardiography Cases will prove invaluable to medical students, cardiovascular practitioners at all levels of training, cardiac sonographers, and for users of hand-held, bedside, point-of-care ultrasound devices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4002430926415866f5250bce3bf7ce5cffb47183","amp;dn":"Practical+Bedside+Ecocardiography+Cases+%28Mac-Graw+Hill%29+%5BPDF%5D%5Bta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4002430926415866f5250bce3bf7ce5cffb47183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,2,67,9,38,65,88,102,245,37,11,206,59,247,206,92,255,180,113,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
