Major emphasis is given to design and practical applications, which are supported by basic theory. Now in its seventh edition, it includes new material on soil consistency, overconsolidated clay, degree of consolidation, vibroflotation and the settlement of sand. KEY TOPICS Chapter topics cover formation of natural soil deposits, engineering properties of soils, soil exploration, soil compaction and stabilization, water in soil, stress distribution in soil, consolidation of soil and settlement of structures, shear strength of soil, shallow foundations, pile foundations, drilled shaft foundations, lateral earth pressure, retaining structures, and stability analysis of slopes. For civil engineers, civil engineering technologists, and geotechnical engineers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:674487aa0fa38a1ddc76f24486796fea5a6db539","amp;dn":"Soils+and+Foundations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"674487aa0fa38a1ddc76f24486796fea5a6db539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,68,135,170,15,163,138,29,220,118,242,68,134,121,111,234,90,109,181,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
