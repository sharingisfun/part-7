Through those letters, she enrolls in a kind of correspondence course, covering Socrates to Sartre, with a mysterious philosopher, while receiving letters addressed to another girl. Who is Hilde? And why does her mail keep turning up? To unravel this riddle, Sophie must use the philosophy she is learning--but the truth turns out to be far more complicated than she could have imagined.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48972252097b95341e2b210fc783fd35a5931563","amp;dn":"Sophie%27s+World+-++A+Novel+About+the+History+of+Philosophy+-+Jost","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48972252097b95341e2b210fc783fd35a5931563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,151,34,82,9,123,149,52,30,43,33,15,199,131,253,53,165,147,21,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
