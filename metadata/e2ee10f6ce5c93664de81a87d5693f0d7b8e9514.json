RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Securom 8\n             1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: FPS\n \n\n When the mission must not fail, the National Command Authority calls in the\n Tier 1 Operators. And we're not talking about those guys who sell candles\n and wicker chairs. We're talking &quot;Tier&quot; 1 with a &quot;T.&quot; They are the best of\n the best the elite-est of the elite. To give you an idea of just how elite\n they are, more than 2 million Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines serve\n in our armed forces. Out of those 2 million, about 50,000 fall under the\n direct control of Special Operations Command. Although their exact numbers\n are classified, only a few hundred out of those 50,000 make the cut as a\n Tier 1 Operator. They are living, breathing, precision instruments of war.\n They are experts in the application of violence. And out of those few\n hundred, only one, namely you, will step into the boots of one of these\n elite warriors in the hostile, unforgiving battlefield conditions in\n present-day Afghanistan. Do you think you have what it takes to confront\n a new enemy who improvises mercilessly in a new kind of war? Do you think\n you have what it takes to be Tier 1? We dare you.\n   \n\n 1. Unrar.\n 2. Burn or mount the image.\n 3. Install the game, use the included keygen when asked for a serial.\n 4. Copy over the cracked content.\n 5. Play the game.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2ee10f6ce5c93664de81a87d5693f0d7b8e9514","amp;dn":"Medal.Of.Honor-RELOADED-%5Btracker.BTARENA.org%5D.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2ee10f6ce5c93664de81a87d5693f0d7b8e9514","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,238,16,246,206,92,147,102,77,232,26,135,213,105,63,13,123,142,149,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
