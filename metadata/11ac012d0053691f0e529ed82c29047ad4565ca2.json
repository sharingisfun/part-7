Dahl is in Africa when World War II breaks out and he leaves Shell to join up with the RAF. This book details Dahl's wartime exploits, which include having a luger pointed at his head by the leader of a German convoy, crash-landing in no-man's land (and sustaining injuries that entailed having his nose pulled out and shaped!) and even surviving a direct hit during the Battle of Athens, when he was sufficiently recovered to fly again Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this time in Hurricanes. The book features black-and-white photos, as well as maps, telegrams and other memorabilia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11ac012d0053691f0e529ed82c29047ad4565ca2","amp;dn":"Going+Solo+-+Roald+Dahl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11ac012d0053691f0e529ed82c29047ad4565ca2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,172,1,45,0,83,105,31,14,82,158,216,44,41,4,122,212,86,92,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
