Domerocker\n02. Our Aimless Dance\n03. The Friction Of The Day\n04. Domerocker (Roland M. Dill's 'Twangbang' Remix)\n\n\nThe cascading, sequential chords of &quot;Domerocker&quot; are a favourite trick of Tejada's; one which he's frequently used in ascending varieties as well. Its bell-like tones remain the focus by dint of no-nonsense percussion.\n\nThere's little time wasted on clever syncopation, with a muffled kick and skipping hats providing a simple rhythm. Though it employs similar percussion, &quot;Our Aimless Dance&quot; is a little more complex, using a nifty glitch effect to squeeze extra interest out of the upper frequencies. At times, this results in a tortured, 303-like squeal, sans the liquid feel. Nonetheless, the track title is the important part. This is a track that seems to perfectly capture that woozy 9 AM dance where Sunday still seems to stretch infinitely ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, &quot;The Friction of the Day&quot; downsizes the lead in order to accomodate wavering pads. It's strangely dichotomous, the lead a searing pulse and the rest soft and cuddly. This time the hook has a circular quality, rolling endlessly along and mutating as it goes. The only remix of the package comes from Germany's Roland M. Dill, who manages to transform &quot;Domerocker&quot; from serene to savage (relatively speaking). Something cowbell-ish and a sharp off-beat twangÃ¢â‚¬â€hence the name &quot;Twangbang&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€set up the rhythm, while Tejada's original chords have been roughed up a bit. It also shows more regard for the dance floor, using big, fuzzy synths to shift through gentle peaks and troughs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7328dd7e799609f4c330b212257d4a4439584088","amp;dn":"John+Tejada+and+Justin+Maxwell+-+Not+That%2C+But+This+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7328dd7e799609f4c330b212257d4a4439584088","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,40,221,126,121,150,9,244,195,48,178,18,37,125,74,68,57,88,64,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
