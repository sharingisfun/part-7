For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nAnyway: The original Blind Boys Of Alabama were five, and then called themselves Five Blind Boys.. Now they're four, and they're old Boys of Alabama, they've been doing this for decades... but they keep on keeping on, and deliver mighty fine and nitty, gritty, southern roots gospel and versions of great spiritual songs..\n\nThere's a twist to their version of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; in here that makes the hair on at least my arm stand up..\n\nMusicians on this record include, amongst others, David Lindley..\n\nThis record was released in 2001, and sample and quality is LAME mp3@320kbps.\n\nEnjoy in Jesus' Name\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3a4c5f48535c53485f575b53567a5d575b535614595557&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e29cf57d23f1860726ca2815451934ab6a7e011e","amp;dn":"Blind+Boys+Of+Alabama+-+Spirit+Of+The+Century%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e29cf57d23f1860726ca2815451934ab6a7e011e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,156,245,125,35,241,134,7,38,202,40,21,69,25,52,171,106,126,1,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
