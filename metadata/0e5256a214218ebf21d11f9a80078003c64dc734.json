This volume provides a valuable perspective on the current state of the field as reflected in multiple aspects of her work, including the nature and evolution of her interpretation of Soviet history; the impact of her scholarship on countless students; and the interaction of personality and individual experiences. Bringing together outstanding essays on such diverse aspects of the Stalin era as the Soviet monopoly on information and communication, violence in the Gulag, and gender relations after World War II, this volume both highlights FitzpatrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legacy and introduces readers to exciting new work in the field.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;This well-deserved tribute to a great historian is a fascinating read for any specialist of the USSR we have learned so much from her&quot; - Cahiers du Monde Russe\n\n&quot;Sheila Fitzpatrick has indeed helped to shape generations of historians of twentieth century Russia in their understanding of Soviet politics, the evolution of the Russian revolution, the inner workings of Stalinism, and lately the dynamics of everyday forms of resistance under Stalinism. She has taken risks with arguments and types of arguments, but most of her main postulates - about social support for the Stalin regime and its contribution to the longevity and relative stability of the Soviet state; about the factions within the cultural worlds and the politics of Soviet bureaucracy - have held up and entered the mainstream of research and teaching about the Soviet period. I think it is inconceivable today for anyone to seriously prepare graduate students in the field without a thorough exposure to Fitzpatrick's contributions.&quot; - Mark Von Hagen, Professor of History and Director, School of Historical, Philosophical, and Religious Studies, Arizona State University\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nGolfo Alexopoulos is an Associate Professor of History at the University of South Florida, and the author of StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Outcasts: Aliens, Citizens, and the Soviet State, 1927-1936.\nJulie Hessler is an Associate Professor of History at University of Oregon.
