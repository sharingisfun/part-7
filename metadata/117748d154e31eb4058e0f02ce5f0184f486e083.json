This is his chance to make things right.\r\n\r\nBoku dake ga Inai Machi follows Satoru in his mission to uncover what truly transpired 18 years ago and prevent the death of his classmate while protecting those he cares about in the present","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:117748d154e31eb4058e0f02ce5f0184f486e083","amp;dn":"%5BARRG%5D+%5BCleo%5D+Boku+dake+ga+Inai+Machi+%7C+Erased+%5B+English+Subbed+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"117748d154e31eb4058e0f02ce5f0184f486e083","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,119,72,209,84,227,30,180,5,142,15,2,206,95,1,132,244,134,224,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
