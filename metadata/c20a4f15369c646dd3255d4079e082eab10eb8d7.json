This exploration of Lightroom kicks off with the essentials: locating, saving, and (most importantly) backing up your catalog. Then author Chris Orwig shows how to clean up and speed up catalogs, access photos on more than one computer, merge multiple catalogs, and export catalog data for use in another program. Last but not least, Chris shows how to back up your catalog periodically, so you don't lose any important changes or photographs down the road.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tLocating a Lightroom catalog\r\n\tâ€¢\tBacking up the catalog\r\n\tâ€¢\tChoosing XMP settings\r\n\tâ€¢\tSyncing folders\r\n\tâ€¢\tMerging two catalogs\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing software for auto backup\r\n\r\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n\r\nHey, dear all downloader, \r\nCould you please to say something, or say ' Hi ' at comment panel down below once you guys finished and success your download, so that I can know how much effective are us?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c20a4f15369c646dd3255d4079e082eab10eb8d7","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Exploring+Lightroom%3A+Managing+Photo+Catalogs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c20a4f15369c646dd3255d4079e082eab10eb8d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,10,79,21,54,156,100,109,211,37,93,64,121,224,130,234,177,14,184,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
