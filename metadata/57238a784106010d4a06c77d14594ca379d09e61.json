I took a lot of the bonus material and sequenced it back into the setlist so it all sounds like one concert.  I also switched the two versions of Comfortably Numb around because Robert Wyatt's version totall blows and ruins the concert.  It is now a bonus track while the superior Geldof version is in the main set.\n\n01 Shine On You Crazy Diamond\n02 Terrapin\n03 Dominoes\n04 Fat Old Sun\n05 Coming Back to Life\n06 High Hopes\n07 High Hopes a capella\n08 Je Crois Entendre Encore\n09 Smile\n10 Wish You Were Here\n11 Comfortablt Numb (w/ Bob Geldof)\n12 The Dimming of the Day\n13 Breakthrough\n14 Shine On You Crazy Diamond Parts 6-8\n15 A Great Day for Freedom\n16 Hushabye Mountain\n\n17 Don't\n18 Sonnet 18\n19 Comfortably Numb (w/ Robert Wyatt)\n20 DVD menu soundscape\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57238a784106010d4a06c77d14594ca379d09e61","amp;dn":"David+Gilmour+-+In+Concert+%28resequenced+by+%7D%7Beywood%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57238a784106010d4a06c77d14594ca379d09e61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,35,138,120,65,6,1,13,74,6,199,125,20,89,76,163,121,208,158,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
