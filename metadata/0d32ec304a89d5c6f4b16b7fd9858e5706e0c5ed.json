This file may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, then this is for you.  I've watched the video and it looks and sounds great on my 50 inch lcd/surround sound system.\n\nSource: DVD Rip\nRunning Time: 3:03 hours\n\nSize: 2.4gb - Note: Seems large, but the quality of this tv movie is on par with my other Farscape rips which averaged 600mb per 45 min episode.  This being a 3 hour show, 600 x 4 = 2.4gb.\n\nContainer: MKV\nVideo: x264\nResolution: 720 x 480, (loose anamorphic 853 x 480)\n\nAudio: English, 5.1 Channels AC3 Dolby Digital\n\nSubtitles: English subrip srt in MKV. (note: you can turn subs on or off)\n\nHope you enjoy!!\n\nPlease seed when you are done...a good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded (1 to 1 ratio)...thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d32ec304a89d5c6f4b16b7fd9858e5706e0c5ed","amp;dn":"Farscape.The.Peacekeeper.Wars.HQ.x264.5.1.ac3.subs-MCH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d32ec304a89d5c6f4b16b7fd9858e5706e0c5ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,50,236,48,74,137,213,198,244,177,107,127,217,133,142,87,6,224,197,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
