At the first day of school, Tessa is a little scared to be going into a world of big-haired, fake-boobed mothers and Red Bull-chugging children, but slowly she and George as well find a way to survive and get along.\n\nAfter Tess gets into the style of things, she starts to realize that the suburbs are not going to be as crazy and wild as it was walking into it. Friendships are made and lives are changed in this single camera comedy. Created by Emily Kapnek (Parks and Recreation), &quot;Suburgatory&quot; takes a look into the life of the suburbs and the different type of people who live there. At first it makes it seem that the suburbs are horrible, but as the show progresses, the families come closer and closer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:989329f5c985e56e3118ff4654565857970de34c","amp;dn":"Suburgatory.S03E04.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"989329f5c985e56e3118ff4654565857970de34c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,147,41,245,201,133,229,110,49,24,255,70,84,86,88,87,151,13,227,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
