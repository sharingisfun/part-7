Though this 1981 film was only Brooks's second, it displays a distinctive, original, and highly effective mise-en-scene: Brooks is a superrealist who uses long takes to hold his characters in a tight compression of time and space, while his even, laconic direction of dialogue short-circuits conventional comic rhythms, going beyond easy payoffs into an almost cosmic apprehension of life's inescapable absurdity. The first part of the film is farcical and very funny; from there it shades into a pointed naturalism and ends on a note of near-tragedy. With Bob Einstein and George Kennedy.\n\nPlease help seed!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73456978a5237b9824b2c6aab2602f2ca3d3749d","amp;dn":"TLC-+Modern+Romance+%281981%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73456978a5237b9824b2c6aab2602f2ca3d3749d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,69,105,120,165,35,123,152,36,178,198,170,178,96,47,44,163,211,116,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
