Anything could have happened. Host Kevin Frasier and the four Married At First Sight experts get the chance to catch up with the couples and ask them the questions America wants answered. Which couples are still together? Have Doug and Jamie had sex yet? Have Jason and Courtney met each other's families? Have Vaughn and Monet talked since the last day of the experiment? And for the first time ever, all three couples are together in the same room to discuss their experiences.\n\n\n\nUploaders Note: My sincerest apologies for the delay in getting this uploaded. I was on vacation and my hotel's firewalls didn't allow me to use my torrent client. With this episode the season is now concluded but stay tuned as they are currently casting for the second season!\n\nEnjoy, and as always, please try to seed for at least 24hours.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d575c202a2d056b8f6a4ce728de2b51014643735","amp;dn":"Married.at.First.Sight.S01E11.6+Months+Later.WEB-DL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d575c202a2d056b8f6a4ce728de2b51014643735","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,117,194,2,162,208,86,184,246,164,206,114,141,226,181,16,20,100,55,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
