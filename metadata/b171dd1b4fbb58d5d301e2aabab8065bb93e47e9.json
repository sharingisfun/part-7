He also explains why Donald Trump may be one of the two best hopes for America's future as we try to regain control of our government, our country, and our national soul.\r\n\r\nThe other hope? As Dr. Savage explains in some of his most heartfelt and passionate words, it is we, the people: the ordinary &quot;Eddies&quot;, as he calls them - motivated, roused, and engaged.\r\n\r\nThis book is about much more than an election. It is a veteran commentator and celebrated raconteur providing a blueprint for how to regain our cherished freedoms and our national identity before they are lost forever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b171dd1b4fbb58d5d301e2aabab8065bb93e47e9","amp;dn":"Michael+Savage+-+Scorched+Earth+-+Restoring+the+Country+After+Ob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b171dd1b4fbb58d5d301e2aabab8065bb93e47e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,113,221,27,79,187,88,213,211,1,226,170,186,184,6,91,185,62,71,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
