It was first released in North America on March 31, 1999, and in Australia on April 8, 1999, and is the first installment in the Matrix series of films, comic books, video games, and animation.\n\nThe film depicts a future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality created by sentient machines to pacify and subdue the human population, while their bodies\\' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Upon learning this, computer programmer \\&quot;Neo\\&quot; is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, involving other people who have been freed from the \\&quot;dream world\\&quot; and into reality.\n\nThe film contains many references to the cyberpunk and hacker subcultures; philosophical and religious ideas such as RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Descartes\\' evil genius, the Allegory of the Cave, the brain in a vat thought experiment; and homages to Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland, Hong Kong action cinema, spaghetti westerns, dystopian fiction, and Japanese animation.\n\n\nPlot\n\nComputer programmer Thomas A. Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is secretly a hacker known by the alias \\&quot;Neo.\\&quot; He is restless, and driven to learn the meaning of cryptic references to \\&quot;the Matrix\\&quot; appearing on his computer. An infamous female hacker named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), confirms that a man named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), knows the answers he seeks; however, three sinister Agents, led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), arrest Neo and attempt to discourage him from having any contact with Morpheus. Undeterred, Neo attends a secret meeting with Morpheus, who offers him a choice of two pills: A blue one that would allow him to continue his ordinary life, and a red pill that would allow him to learn the truth about the Matrix. Neo swallows the red pill, and he abruptly finds himself in a liquid-filled pod, his body connected by tubes and cables to a vast mechanical tower covered with identical pods. The connections are severed, and he is rescued by Morpheus and taken aboard his ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. Neo\\'s atrophied physical body is restored, and Morpheus explains the situation.\n\nMorpheus tells Neo that it is not 1999, but closer to 2199, and that humanity is fighting a war against intelligent machines created in the early 21st century. The sky is covered by thick black clouds created by the humans in an attempt to cut off the machines\\' supply of solar power. The machines responded by using human beings as their energy source in conjunction with nuclear fusion, later growing countless people in pods and harvesting their bioelectrical energy and body heat. The world in which Neo grew up was actually the Matrix, a simulated reality of the world set in 1999, developed by the machines in order to keep the human captives docile. Morpheus and his crew belong to a group of free humans who \\&quot;unplug\\&quot; others from the Matrix and recruit them to their resistance against the machines. They are able to use their understanding of the Matrix\\'s nature to bend the simulation\\'s laws of physics, giving them superhuman abilities within the virtual world. Morpheus believes that Neo is \\&quot;the One,\\&quot; a man prophesied to end the war through his limitless control over the Matrix.\n\nNeo is trained as a member of the rebellion. A socket in Neo\\'s skull, formerly used by the machines to connect him to the Matrix, allows knowledge to be uploaded directly into his mind. In this way, he is able to quickly learn numerous martial arts styles, and impresses the crew with his speed when sparring in the rebels\\' virtual reality \\&quot;construct\\&quot; environment. Further training introduces Neo to the key dangers in the Matrix itself. He learns that fatal injuries suffered within the simulation will also kill one\\'s physical body in the real world. He is warned that the Agents he previously met are powerful sentient computer programs with the ability to possess the virtual body of anyone still directly connected to the Matrix, whose purpose is to seek out and eliminate any threats to the simulation. Morpheus is confident that once Neo fully understands his own abilities as \\&quot;the One\\&quot;, the Agents will be no match for him.\n\nThe group enters the Matrix and takes Neo to meet the Oracle (Gloria Foster), the woman who has predicted the eventual emergence of the One. From her comments, Neo infers that he is not the One. The Oracle adds that Morpheus believes in Neo so blindly that he will sacrifice his life to save him.\n\nReturning to the hacked telephone line which serves as a safe \\&quot;exit\\&quot; from the Matrix, the group is surrounded by Agents and SWAT teams. One of the members of the group, Mouse (Matt Doran), is killed in the initial ambush. Morpheus stays behind to delay the agents, allowing Neo and the others to escape. They learn that they were betrayed by their fellow crew-member Cypher (Joe Pantoliano), who preferred his old life in the Matrix over the real world, and who had made a deal with the machines to have himself reinserted into the Matrix in exchange for giving them Morpheus. Cypher is killed, but his betrayal leads to the deaths of all crew-members except Neo, Trinity, Tank (Marcus Chong), and Morpheus.\n\nMorpheus is held in a government building in the Matrix. The Agents try to coerce him into revealing the access codes to the mainframe of Zion, the humans\\' subterranean refuge in the real world. Neo and Trinity storm the building to rescue their leader. Neo becomes more confident in his ability to manipulate the Matrix, ultimately dodging bullets fired at him. Escaping to a subway station, Morpheus and Trinity use a pay phone to exit the Matrix, but before Neo can leave he is ambushed by Agent Smith. Neo stands his ground and eventually causes Smith to get hit by a train, but flees when the Agent possesses another body.\n\n\nProduction\n\nDirected by Andy Wachowski\nLarry Wachowski\nProduced by Joel Silver\nWritten by Andy Wachowski\nLarry Wachowski\nStarring Keanu Reeves\nLaurence Fishburne\nCarrie-Anne Moss\nHugo Weaving\nJoe Pantoliano\nMusic by Don Davis\nCinematography Bill Pope\nEditing by Zach Staenberg\nStudio Village Roadshow Pictures\nSilver Pictures\nDistributed by Warner Bros.
