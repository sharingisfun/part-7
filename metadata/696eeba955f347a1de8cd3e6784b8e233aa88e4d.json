Take your pick.*\n*Uses custom AutoKMS_VL_ALL folder in Windows directory. You can\nuninstall the daily task there if you wish to use a different\nactivator later. I've included the uninstall script.\n-Highly Compressed install.esd recovery compression format.\n-UEFI boot information added to ISO boot data\n\nNotes:\n-v1 was missing the non-activated ProWMC index. Nothing else was wrong\n with it. You don't need to download this if you don't want the ProWMC\n index. Nothing is different except the additional index and a slightly\n newer version of the activator. If you have v1, this activator will\n likely not fix any issues you have with it.\n-First proper Win81AIO with pre-activation\n-All indexes use original MSDN 9/9 Win8.1 isos with integrated hotfixes.\n-Added ei.cfg to sources directory. You *HAVE* to extract the iso and\n delete the file if you want to upgrade from a previous version of\n Windows. Use the win81-pkeys.txt on the ISO for install keys.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:696eeba955f347a1de8cd3e6784b8e233aa88e4d","amp;dn":"Windows+8.1+AIO+20in1+x64+Pre-Activated","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"696eeba955f347a1de8cd3e6784b8e233aa88e4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,110,235,169,85,243,71,161,222,140,211,230,120,75,142,35,58,168,142,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
