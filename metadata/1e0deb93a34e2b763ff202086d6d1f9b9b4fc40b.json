Gliding in a dynamic flow to expand the boundaries of inspiration, Roland Voss aka Lemongrass succeeded once again, to define the essence of our wonderful world. The very title of his new album &quot;Meditation&quot; is a clear and powerful statement. \nSteeped in silence and serenity, it effortlessly bridges the gap between modern Electronica, Ambient and Chillout towards relaxation &amp; meditation music. \nWith a great sensitivity and the courage to allow moments of stillness to appear, Lemongrass intones a subtle space of consciousness. Playing with the respective\nmoods, colours and lights, Roland Voss creates different imaginary scenarios. From his &quot;Ambient Garden&quot; he takes us to the gentle waves of the Atlantic ocean (&quot;Contemplation&quot;), and to the depths of the night (&quot;Night Flow&quot;). \nOne feels with every tone: this album is build on authentic, day-to-day\nexperiences by a mature personality, offering theopportunity to relax and to let go.\n\nArtists Lemongrass\nRelease Date 2015-02-06\nLabels Lemongrassmusic\nCatalog LGM178 \nAudio codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 320 kbps\nDuration: 2:04:32","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e0deb93a34e2b763ff202086d6d1f9b9b4fc40b","amp;dn":"Lemongrass+-+Meditation+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e0deb93a34e2b763ff202086d6d1f9b9b4fc40b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,13,235,147,163,78,43,118,63,242,2,8,109,109,31,155,155,79,196,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
