Filled with biographical elements of Bergman\\&amp;#039;s own childhood and latent with powerful symbolism and deep melancholy this extraordinary film is an epitome of Bergman\\&amp;#039;s entire opus. \n\nThis is the original Swedish television mini-series clocking in at just over 5 hours, NOT the 3-hour theatrical release.
