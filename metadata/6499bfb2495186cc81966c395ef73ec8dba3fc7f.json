Their California psychedelia was very much in the mold of fellow Elektra artists Love, Tim Buckley, and especially the Doors, which is hardly a coincidence; like all of these artists, Clear Light worked with producer Paul Rothchild and engineer Bruce Botnick. Several of the members went on to notable careers: Douglas Lubahn played bass on several Doors albums, Dallas Taylor drummed for Crosby, Stills, &amp; Nash, keyboardist Ralph Schuckett became a prolific session musician, and Cliff De Young became a prolific TV movie actor.\n\n\nReview   by Matthew Greenwald  Allmusic.com\nKind of a minor league version of the Doors, Clear Light were a West Coast phenomenon, and although they didn't last too long, were an interesting group. A very good slice of Los Angeles psychedelia, Clear Light were a six-piece band that combined folk, rock, psychedelia, and even a touch of classical to their sound. The end result, though, is a little ponderous and pretentious, but strangely listenable. The big hit off this album (produced by Paul Rothchild and engineered by Bruce Botnick) was &quot;Mr. Blue,&quot; a psychedelic folk song written by Tom Paxton. It's over six-minutes long and a bit overbaked, but it does have an odd appeal. The finer moments are guitarist Bob Seal's psychedelic folk-rock songs, namely &quot;With All in Mind&quot; and &quot;They Who Have Nothing.&quot; Singer Cliff DeYoung went on to have a successful acting career, bass player Doug Lubahn played on the early Doors albums, Dallas Taylor went on to drum for Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young and John Sebastian, and keyboardist Ralph Schuckett became one of the more popular West Coast session players and arrangers. A lot of talent in a short-lived ensemble. Dated but charming West Coast psychedelia.\n\nTracklist:\n01. Black Roses\n02. Sand\n03. A Child's Smile\n04. Street Singer\n05.
