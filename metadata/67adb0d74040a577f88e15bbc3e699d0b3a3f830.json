So what&amp;#039;s the difference then?\n\n1. I have converted the original .DAA (Power ISO) file format to a .ISO (Standard ISO format). I don&amp;#039;t think anyone really needs the shitty .DAA file format, because the software needed to open it is Power ISO and Power ISO is as we know proprietary software. So you would need to first download Power ISO and crack it which is just waste of time. And then the shitty Power ISO software is the only software on the market that can handle .DAA file format. Why do we need that? On the other hand, Daemon Tools is another software of the same type as Power ISO, and Daemon Tools is completely free. Daemon Tools handles the most popular Image file formats like ISO, BIN/CUE, NRG (the Nero image format) and many more (except the shitty DAA). You can download Daemon Tools at http://www.daemon-tools.cc\n\n2. I have added the VM Ware keygen as part of the ISO file. So all you need to carry with you is one single file. When you mount the ISO into Daemon Tools you get access to both the setup program and the Keygen.\n\n3. I have deleted the Serial.txt file from the original .DAA image because it contained a serial number for VM Ware Workstation 6 that is no longer valid. So there is no need to keep it.\n\n4. Well, obviously the file size differs also since this is a ISO file and the original one is DAA file. But the difference is only like 3 - 10 MB, not more. So it&amp;#039;s almost no difference. And the difference is not due to any added virus or anything like that.\n\nI hope that you will find this torrent more clean and more portable so that you can use it in basically any CD/DVD-ROM emulator like Daemon Tools or what so ever.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67adb0d74040a577f88e15bbc3e699d0b3a3f830","amp;dn":"VM+Ware+Workstation+6.0+ACE+Edition+with+Keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67adb0d74040a577f88e15bbc3e699d0b3a3f830","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,173,176,215,64,64,165,119,248,142,21,187,195,230,153,208,179,163,248,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
