It can do many things, such as schedule recordings, configure motion detection and search your recordings (and a whole lot more).\n\nIf you wish, you can set up this software so that it watches specific objects, then informs you when they go missing. It is also possible to mask those areas of your picture which you think are not relevant so that trivial and unimportant movements do not end up triggering its motion detection capabilities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c44b17249fd442f6f8c3fa66517ca8be9472841","amp;dn":"Geovision.v8.5.3%5Bamigo.no-ip.org%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c44b17249fd442f6f8c3fa66517ca8be9472841","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,68,177,114,73,253,68,47,111,140,63,166,101,23,202,139,233,71,40,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
