They discuss the diagnostic criteria of the disorder as listed in the DSM-IV and distinguish symptoms of ADHD, such as impulsivity and difficulty focusing on tasks, from personality flaws such as laziness or self-indulgence. According to the authors, ADHD symptoms are caused by neurological differences and cannot be changed at will or &quot;cured,&quot; although they can be managed through coping strategies and medications. The authors describe the biological mechanisms thought to underlie ADHD symptoms and also describe a variety of subtypes of ADHD.\nThe authors discuss the effects that ADHD can have on the sufferer's life, including:\nUnderperformance at school as a child;\nUnderperformance at work as an adult;\nInterpersonal difficulties, including short temper, impulsive behavior, and perceived irresponsibility;\nCompulsive behavior and low self-esteem\nThe authors then discuss strategies for treating and coping with ADHD, including obtaining a diagnosis by a qualified professional, treatment with medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy, symptom management through diet and exercise, and coping strategies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:420d73cd9a1f0f1e52a20af38f83748cedce9e12","amp;dn":"Dri+Distraction+by+Hallowell+%26amp%3B+Ratey+%5BADD+ADHD%5D+%5BABRIDGED%5D-A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"420d73cd9a1f0f1e52a20af38f83748cedce9e12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,13,115,205,154,31,15,30,82,162,10,243,143,131,116,140,237,206,158,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
