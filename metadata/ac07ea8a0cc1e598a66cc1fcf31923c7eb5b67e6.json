As if that weren't enough, McCauley's wedding engagement collapsed under the weight of his own excessive behavior and impossible lifestyle. Like any true artist, McCauley channeled his anger, sadness, and regret into his work, resulting in what can be safely declared his finest collection of songs to date, impassioned and interior and increasingly mature, both as expression of emotion as well as pure unadulterated songcraft.\n\n  Deer Tick -- sounding as sure-footed as one would expect from a band known for spending a couple of hundred nights each year on stage -- more than match the strength of the material by taking a more detailed approach than on some of the breakneck recordings of their past. From the sparkling baroque pop of &quot;The Dream's In The Ditch&quot; to the full-blown Memphis showstopper, &quot;Trash,&quot; Negativity sees the Tick bridging boozy punk, AM gold, bar band blues, country soul, and whatever else catches their fancy into their own profoundly American rock 'n' roll.
