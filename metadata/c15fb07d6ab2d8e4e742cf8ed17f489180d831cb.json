Whether you're baking for a friend's birthday or bringing a thank-you gift, this book is your guide to creating elegant and tasty treats for any celebration.\nHandmade Gifts from the Kitchen is a delightful gift in itself, as well as providing a beautiful collection of culinary gift ideas for you to make and bake at home for friends and family. In a world where mass-produced is the norm, homemade carries a certain potency of care and thought, and indulgent fudge, warming liqueurs, spicy chutneys, sweet and crumbly homemade biscuits are easy to make, affordable, and meaningful gifts. They are perfect for Christmas, Easter, or Thanksgiving, or for everyday giving.\nAnd it's not just the making, it's the wrapping, too. Decorative jars, tins, baskets, and boxes add a personal touch that ensures these gifts will still be remembered long after the food has been enjoyed. That said, a range of containers isn't essential; Handmade Gifts from the Kitchen offers ideas for wrapping your gifts in a stunning and stylish way, so that every gift is special.\n\nAbout the Author\nALISON WALKER is the Food and Drink Editor of Country Living magazine and loves cooking comfort food using seasonal ingredients.
