That gets him into trouble and to get things sorted out Uncle Fred does what he does best and that is assuming somebody else's identity. Ive always found that one of the elements Wodehouse was at his best at is impostors and people with false identities in general. It is a recurring theme in Jeeves novels and stories and in other of his works in general.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81a886559d4609f970c33b2e09de27ba11233ca8","amp;dn":"PG+Wodehouse+-+Cocktail+Time+%28Unabridged+-+Read+by+Jonathan+Ceci","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81a886559d4609f970c33b2e09de27ba11233ca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,168,134,85,157,70,9,249,112,195,59,46,9,222,39,186,17,35,60,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
