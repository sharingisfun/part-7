This is the first of a series of new HELLBLAZER collections that put all his adventures in reading order, capturing Constantine at his youthful, anarchic best.\n\nBack Blurb\n\nWelcome to a Fallen World...\n\n...a haunted world of black magic, demons, and the ghosts of past mistakes --- the world of John Constantine, Hellblazer.\n\nAs one of the few magicians who understand both the possibilities and the dangers of his art. Liverpool native John Constantine has managed to keep himself from becoming lost in its dark power --- but he also cannot escape its seductive, addictive hold. Unfortunately, while Constantine may understand magic's true price, the world is full of amateurs willing to sign away their souls for a taste of it --- and like it or not, his hard-won knowledge guarantees that he'll always be in the middle of the mess that follows.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1b290fc03645079384ff6178fa56c5d8ec88ed4","amp;dn":"John_Constantine%2C_Hellblazer_Vol._01_-_Original_Sins_%282011%29_%28dig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1b290fc03645079384ff6178fa56c5d8ec88ed4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,178,144,252,3,100,80,121,56,79,246,23,143,165,108,93,142,200,142,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
