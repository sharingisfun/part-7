Discs in 1995. In 1998 Q magazine readers voted it the 46th greatest album of all time. Weller claimed on a BBC special that he hopes he can one day create an album as perfect as this one, stating that all the stars were aligned during the writing and recording period of Stanley Road\n\nThis album has class and it sees Paul Weller once again firmly in control of every aspect: he wrote all the songs bar a cover of Dr. John's &quot;I Walk on Gilded Splinters&quot;; he co-produced it and, apart from his earthy vocals, he plays guitar, piano, organ and percussion. All the tracks are special, but it's the three hits--&quot;Changingman&quot;, &quot;Broken Stones&quot; and the truly wonderful &quot;You Do Something To Me&quot;--that really stand out, as does &quot;Porcelain Gods&quot;, which has something of the old Style Council about it. Soulful, the style is underlined by Carleen Anderson's rich backing vocals on five of the tracks. Weller is also joined by some of his other musical chums: Noel Gallagher, Steve Craddock and Steve Winwood.\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n&quot;The Changingman&quot; (Brendan Lynch, Paul Weller, Lee Mavers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:02\n&quot;Porcelain Gods&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:51\n&quot;I Walk on Gilded Splinters&quot; (Dr. John) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:24\n&quot;You Do Something to Me&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:38\n&quot;Woodcutter's Son&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:43\n&quot;Time Passes...&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:56\n&quot;Stanley Road&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:18\n&quot;Broken Stones&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:16\n&quot;Out of the Sinking&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:51\n&quot;Pink on White Walls&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:39\n&quot;Whirlpools' End&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:11\n&quot;Wings of Speed&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:13\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:416e59629a7956b9f08963e917fc3ab837cd5586","amp;dn":"Paul+Weller+-+Stanley+Road","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"416e59629a7956b9f08963e917fc3ab837cd5586","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,110,89,98,154,121,86,185,240,137,99,233,23,252,58,184,55,205,85,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
