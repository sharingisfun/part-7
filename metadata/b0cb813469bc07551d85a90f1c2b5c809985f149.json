Crime goes down. The prison population doubles.\nFraud by the rich wipes out 40 percent of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wealth. The rich get massively richer. No one goes to jail.\n \nIn search of a solution, journalist Matt Taibbi discovered the Divide, the seam in American life where our two most troubling trendsÃ¢â‚¬â€growing wealth inequality and mass incarcerationÃ¢â‚¬â€come together, driven by a dramatic shift in American citizenship: Our basic rights are now determined by our wealth or poverty. The Divide is what allows massively destructive fraud by the hyperwealthy to go unpunished, while turning poverty itself into a crimeÃ¢â‚¬â€but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible to see until you look at these two alarming trends side by side.\n \nIn The Divide, Matt Taibbi takes readers on a galvanizing journey through both sides of our new system of justiceÃ¢â‚¬â€the fun-house-mirror worlds of the untouchably wealthy and the criminalized poor. He uncovers the startling looting that preceded the financial collapse; a wild conspiracy of billionaire hedge fund managers to destroy a company through dirty tricks; and the story of a whistleblower who gets in the way of the largest banks in America, only to find herself in the crosshairs. On the other side of the Divide, Taibbi takes us to the front lines of the immigrant dragnet; into the newly punitive welfare system which treats its beneficiaries as thieves; and deep inside the stop-and-frisk world, where standing in front of your own home has become an arrestable offense. As he narrates these incredible stories, he draws out and analyzes their common source: a perverse new standard of justice, based on a radical, disturbing new vision of civil rights.\n \nThrough astonishingÃ¢â‚¬â€and enragingÃ¢â‚¬â€accounts of the high-stakes capers of the wealthy and nightmare stories of regular people caught in the DivideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s punishing logic, Taibbi lays bare one of the greatest challenges we face in contemporary American life: surviving a system that devours the lives of the poor, turns a blind eye to the destructive crimes of the wealthy, and implicates us all.\n\nPraise for The Divide\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ambitious . . . deeply reported, highly compelling . . . impossible to put down.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The New York Times Book Review\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“These are the stories that will keep you up at night. . . . The Divide is not just a report from the new America; it is advocacy journalism at its finest.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Los Angeles Times\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[Matt] Taibbi is a relentless investigative reporter. He takes readers inside not only investment banks, hedge funds and the blood sport of short-sellers, but into the lives of the needy, minorities, street drifters and illegal immigrants, to juxtapose justice for the poor and the powerful. . . . The Divide is an important book. Its documentation is powerful and shocking.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The Washington Post\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[TaibbiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s] warning is all about moral hazard. . . . When swindlers know that their risks will be subsidized . . . they will surely commit more crimes. And when most of the population either does not know or does not care that the lowest socioeconomic classes live in something akin to a police state, we should be greatly concerned for the moral health of our society.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The Wall Street Journal\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Taibbi [is] perhaps the greatest reporter on Wall StreetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crimes in the modern era.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Salon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0cb813469bc07551d85a90f1c2b5c809985f149","amp;dn":"The+Divide+-+Matt+Taibbi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0cb813469bc07551d85a90f1c2b5c809985f149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,203,129,52,105,188,7,85,29,133,169,15,28,43,92,128,153,133,241,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
