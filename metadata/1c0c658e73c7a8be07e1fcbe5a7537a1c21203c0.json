It offers a unique presentation in providing both theory and philosophy in a technical yet entertaining way.\n\n\nReading Anatomy of a Robot is like having a robot on the operating room table. Crack open the pages, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to dissect a robot from head to toeÃ¢â‚¬â€or from project management and design to motors and power systems.\n\nDiscover how robots articulate movements, how they see and hear, what gives them their power, and, at times, their gentleness. Delve into the robotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“brains,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and learn how experienced robot designers use control systems to make their machines think.\n\nMuch more than an enumeration of parts, Anatomy of a Robot exposes the life and human creativity behind todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s robot. Always entertaining, this exceptional book takes you deep inside the theory and craft, philosophy and science of robotics. Coverage ranges from control systems and computer hardware to Ã¢â‚¬Å“nuts and boltsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ topics such as actuators and mechanics, with plenty of humor and mathematical equations to help with the anatomy lesson.\n\nA must for robot professionals and serious robot hobbyists, and a treat for science lovers and teachers, Anatomy of a Robot is a journey inside one of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most exciting and fast-moving disciplines.\n\nwhat makes robots work \n* Sensors \n* Algorithms \n* Plans \n* Controls \n* Systems \n* Quality \n* Computers \n* Power \n* Actuators \n* Project Management \n* Reliability \n* Artificial Intelligence \n* Feedback","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c0c658e73c7a8be07e1fcbe5a7537a1c21203c0","amp;dn":"Anatomy+of+a+Robot+2003","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c0c658e73c7a8be07e1fcbe5a7537a1c21203c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,12,101,142,115,199,168,190,7,225,252,190,90,117,55,161,194,18,3,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
