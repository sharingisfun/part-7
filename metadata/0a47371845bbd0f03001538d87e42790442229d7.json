Translated from the Italian and annotated by Jonathan Galassi.\n\nISBN: 0374125546 |  626 pages | Bilingual Edition | PDF\n\n\nEUGENIO MONTALE (1896-1981) was an Italian poet, prose writer, editor and translator, and recipient of the 1975 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nMontale is widely recognized as having brought the great Italian lyric tradition that began with Dante into the twentieth century with unrivaled power and brilliance.  Here is a love poet whose deeply beautiful, individual work confronts the dilemmas of modern history, philosophy, and faith with courage and subtlety.  He has been widely translated into English and his work has influenced two generations of American and British poets.\n\nJonathan Galassi's versions of Montale's major works -- &quot;Ossi di seppia&quot;, &quot;Le occasioni&quot;, and &quot;La bufera e altro&quot; -- are the clearest and most convincing yet.  Galassi's extensive notes and interpretive essay, &quot;Reading Montale&quot;, elucidate the extremely rich content in the poet's often dense and allusive poetry.\n\nThis book offers English-language readers uniquely informed and readable access to the work of one of the greatest of all modern poets.\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;GalassiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ‚Â volume is unlikely to be superseded for a long time.&quot; -- Jamie McKendrick, London Review of Books\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a47371845bbd0f03001538d87e42790442229d7","amp;dn":"Eugenio+Montale+-+Collected+Poems%2C+1920-1954","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a47371845bbd0f03001538d87e42790442229d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,71,55,24,69,187,208,240,48,1,83,141,135,228,39,144,68,34,41,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
