The eggs were demanded as ransom for her kidnapped fiancÃƒÂ©. She boards a plane for the Latin American city of Ladera, as per instructions, and is met by Mike Chambers. Caroline first believes that Mike is one of the kidnappers, until a mysterious man in a trench-coat tries to kill her, and Mike comes to the rescue. They are then both captured by a band of Mexican bandits, who also may or may not be part of the scheme. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093440/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093440/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 560x416\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 915 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,17 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf8f35a4b7c12a331c2dfdf195a9f550c703b32e","amp;dn":"Love+Among+Thieves+%281987%29+Audrey+Hepburn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf8f35a4b7c12a331c2dfdf195a9f550c703b32e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,143,53,164,183,193,42,51,28,45,253,241,149,169,245,80,199,3,179,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
