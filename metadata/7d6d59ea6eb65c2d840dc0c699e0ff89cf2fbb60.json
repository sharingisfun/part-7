G. Wells. It features Academy Award nominated actor Richard Burton, Justin Hayward (of The Moody Blues), Chris Thompson (of Manfred Mann), Phil Lynott (of Thin Lizzy), Julie Covington (of Evita), and David Essex (Evita). Wayne conducts what would come to be known as the Black Smoke Band and the ULLAdubULLA string orchestra.\n&quot;Forever Autumn&quot;, &quot;The Eve of the War&quot;, &quot;Thunder Child&quot;, and &quot;The Spirit of Man&quot; are the most recognised individual songs on the album. &quot;Forever Autumn&quot; was a UK Top 5 single, sung by Justin Hayward. The album itself spent 290 weeks in the UK album charts. It was in the top 10 in 22 countries and reached #1 in 11 countries.\nMost of the lyrics on the album were written by former Elton John lyricist Gary Osborne.\nThe album was one of the first recorded on 48 tracks, using two synchronised 24 track Studer 80s at Advision Studios in London. It was engineered by Geoff Young, who was instrumental in bringing the recordings together with only a 16 track desk. His skill in this regard was later recognised by George Michael, who worked with him to record &quot;Last Christmas&quot; and &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; using the same studio and equipment.\nThe repetition of &quot;Ulla!&quot;, the cry made by the Martians, and certain musical refrains throughout the musical act as leitmotifs.\nThe official album comes with several paintings by Peter Goodfellow, Geoff Taylor and Michael Trim that help to illustrate the story from beginning to end.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d6d59ea6eb65c2d840dc0c699e0ff89cf2fbb60","amp;dn":"War+Of+The+Worlds+OST+%28Jeff+Wayne%5C%27s%29+2CDRip+2009+%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d6d59ea6eb65c2d840dc0c699e0ff89cf2fbb60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,109,89,234,110,182,92,45,132,13,192,198,153,224,255,137,207,47,187,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
