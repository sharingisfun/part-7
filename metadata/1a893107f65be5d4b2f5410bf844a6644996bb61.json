The video for it will be shown on Vevo and the two will perform the single together.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a893107f65be5d4b2f5410bf844a6644996bb61","amp;dn":"Brandy+%26amp%3B+Monica+-+It+All+Belongs+To+Me+%5BMP3+2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a893107f65be5d4b2f5410bf844a6644996bb61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,137,49,7,246,91,229,212,178,245,65,11,248,68,166,100,73,150,187,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
