The universe opened up to us. Now in ULTIMA the consequences of this new freedom make themselves felt. And we discover that there are minds in the universe that are billions of years old and they have a plan for us. For some of us. But as we learn the true nature of the universe we also discover that we have countless pasts all meeting in this present and that our future is terrifyingly finite. It's time for us to fight to take back control.\n\nThis is grand scale, big idea SF of the best possible sort. It is set to build on the massive success of PROXIMA and define Stephen Baxter's work going forward.\n\nRead by Kyle McCarley\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09a65bd893ee8ec9bf6e2dd2dddac742ccd66882","amp;dn":"Stephen+Baxter+-+Ultima+%28Proxima+%232%29+%5BFIXED%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09a65bd893ee8ec9bf6e2dd2dddac742ccd66882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,166,91,216,147,238,142,201,191,110,45,210,221,218,199,66,204,214,104,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
