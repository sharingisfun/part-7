A scream, a moan, and a death rattle slowly pull Andrei Danilovich Komiaga out of his drunken stupor. But waitÃ¢â‚¬â€thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just his ring tone. So begins another day in the life of an oprichnik, one of the czarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most trusted courtiersÃ¢â‚¬â€and one of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most feared men.\n\nIn this new New Russia, where futuristic technology and the draconian codes of Ivan the Terrible are in perfect synergy, Komiaga will attend extravagant parties, partake in brutal executions, and consume an arsenal of drugs. He will rape and pillage, and he will be moved to tears by the sweetly sung songs of his homeland.\n\nVladimir Sorokin has imagined a near future both too disturbing to contemplate and too realistic to dismiss. But like all of his best work, SorokinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new novel explodes with invention and dark humor. A startling, relentless portrait of a troubled and troubling empire, Day of the Oprichnik is at once a richly imagined vision of the future and a razor-sharp diagnosis of a country in crisis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324d1e1aaee71801c440b09fefe0fc2edbef0ead","amp;dn":"Sorokin%2C+Vladimir+-+Day+of+the+Oprichnik.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324d1e1aaee71801c440b09fefe0fc2edbef0ead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,77,30,26,174,231,24,1,196,64,176,159,239,224,252,46,219,239,14,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
