And on November 22, 2013, the nation remembered the 50th anniversary of one of the most traumatic events in modern American history, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  \n\nFrom day one, the truth behind JFKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assassination has been mired in controversy and dispute. The Warren Commission, established just seven days after KennedyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, delved into the who, what, when, and where of the tragedy, and over the course of the following year compiled an 889-page report that arrived at the now widely contested conclusion: Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole assassin.  \n\nIn Who Really Killed Kennedy?, No. 1 New York Times best-selling author Jerome R. Corsi, Ph.D., provides readers with the ultimate JFK assassination theory book.\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Jerome R. Corsi received a Ph.D. from Harvard University in political science in 1972. He is a senior commentator for TeaParty.org where he works as an investigative journalist.
