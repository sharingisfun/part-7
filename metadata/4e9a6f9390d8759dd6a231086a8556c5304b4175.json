A left-field hybrid of norteno, Swamp Pop, rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; roll, blues, country and everything in between, Texas Tornadoes were fronted by Tejano star Flaco Jimenez, &amp;#039;60s rock icon Doug Sahm, crooner Freddy Fender, and Sahm&amp;#039;s cohort from the Sir Douglas Quintet, Augie Meyers. The Tornadoes hit the country charts with their debut album -- quite a feat considering how far removed from the Nashville norm the group&amp;#039;s sound was. Though they never repeated that success on their subsequent records, the band retained a large and loyal worldwide following. They disbanded after the unexpected death of Doug Sahm in 1999.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e9a6f9390d8759dd6a231086a8556c5304b4175","amp;dn":"TEXAS+TORNADOS+-+4+CDS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e9a6f9390d8759dd6a231086a8556c5304b4175","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,154,111,147,144,216,117,157,214,162,49,8,106,133,86,197,48,75,65,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
