Each stage has 4 or 5 zones (Not including the training stages). You must move Woody to zone from zone, The Neighbour moves with them as time goes by. Sometimes you can distract him with different ways (such as call him to make him go downstairs) or he gets distracted automatically (For example, painting, washing clothes, and so on.)
