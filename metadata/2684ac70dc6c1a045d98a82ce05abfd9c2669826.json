Correcting these\nissues can be a time consuming task. No longer\nimagine a trained professional on hand to help\nPerfectTUNES is that professional, an application\nwhich:\n\nAlbum Art automatically add missing covers\nCover art is used both to identify albums when\nbrowsing, as well as for the visual appeal when\nplaying a track. Missing or low resolution cover\nart, does not cut it these days when typically a\ncollection might be controlled through a high\nresolution tablet\n\nAccurateRip check lossless tracks for ripping\nerrors\nAround 2% of all ripped discs have errors, discs do\nnot even have to be scratched to give an error\nsuch as from manufacturing defects. CD drives on\ntheir own cannot determine if a ripped track has\nerrors (using c2 pointers, or re-ripping), ripping\nerrors could be speaker-popping-noise, or silence\n(where the drive interpolates the error)\n\nDeDup remove duplicate tracks\nDe-Dup listens to your collection and presents a\nlist of tracks which are duplicates. Often a\nduplicate is a lower quality copy of a track (such\nas a lower mp3 bitrate), or a track appearing on\nboth a compilation and original album\n\nInstall Notes\n\n1.
