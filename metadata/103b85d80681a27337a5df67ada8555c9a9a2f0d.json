Largely, though, it's the same dependable sparsely arranged, strong material, with support from noted musicians Nina Gerber, Tony Rice, Norton Buffalo, and Darol Anger.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:103b85d80681a27337a5df67ada8555c9a9a2f0d","amp;dn":"Kate+Wolf+-+Close+to+You+%5B1981%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"103b85d80681a27337a5df67ada8555c9a9a2f0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,59,133,216,6,129,162,115,55,165,223,103,173,168,85,92,154,154,47,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
