Levine (CRC, 2011).pdf\r\n\r\nAt publication, The Control Handbook immediately became the definitive resource that engineers working with modern control systems required. Among its many accolades, that first edition was cited by the AAP as the Best Engineering Handbook of 1996.\r\n\r\nNow, 15 years later, William Levine has once again compiled the most comprehensive and authoritative resource on control engineering. He has fully reorganized the text to reflect the technical advances achieved since the last edition and has expanded its contents to include the multidisciplinary perspective that is making control engineering a critical component in so many fields.\r\n\r\nNow expanded from one to three volumes, The Control Handbook, Second Edition brilliantly organizes cutting-edge contributions from more than 200 leading experts representing every corner of the globe. The first volume, Control System Fundamentals, offers an overview for those new to the field but is also of great value to those across any number of fields whose work is reliant on but not exclusively dedicated to control systems. Covering mathematical fundamentals, defining principles, and basic system approaches, this volume:\r\n\r\nDetails essential background, including transforms and complex variables\r\nIncludes mathematical and graphical models used for dynamical systems\r\nCovers analysis and design methods and stability testing for continuous-time systems\r\nDelves into digital control and discrete-time systems, including real-time software for implementing feedback control and programmable controllers\r\nAnalyzes design methods for nonlinear systems\r\n\r\nAs with the first edition, the new edition not only stands as a record of accomplishment in control engineering but provides researchers with the means to make further advances. Progressively organized, the other two volumes in the set include:\r\n\r\nControl System Applications\r\nControl System Advanced Methods","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2024067982416f2bca43cb21b76f77b4a4fe189e","amp;dn":"Control+System+Fundamentals+%28The+Control+Handbook%29+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2024067982416f2bca43cb21b76f77b4a4fe189e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,36,6,121,130,65,111,43,202,67,203,33,183,111,119,180,164,254,24,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
