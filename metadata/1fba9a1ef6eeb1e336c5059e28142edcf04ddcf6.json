It continues the story from the point reached in the earlier monograph, Prehistory. The dominant theme here is provided by the Indus civilization. \n\nIn addition, other contemporary and later cultures down to about 1500 bc, and the formation of the major language families of India, are discussed. The Indus  civilization seeks to maintain uniformity with Prehistory in style and framework, except for slight relaxation of the commitment to conciseness. It contains more detailed exposition of certain topics, and the explanatory notes on technical and controversial subjects at the end of each chapter are somewhat longer. Illustrations, maps and tables are included to serve as aids to understand the subject better","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fba9a1ef6eeb1e336c5059e28142edcf04ddcf6","amp;dn":"The+Indus+Civilization+by+Irfan+Habib+%28History+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fba9a1ef6eeb1e336c5059e28142edcf04ddcf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,186,154,30,246,238,177,227,54,197,5,158,40,20,46,220,240,77,220,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
