At the time, Valens had only recently established himself as one of the most promising young talents in rock &amp; roll, just barely missing the top of the charts with &quot;Donna,&quot; a number two hit, and pioneering a blend of rock and Latin music with the single's almost equally popular flip side, &quot;La Bamba.&quot; Like many rock stars who died prematurely, it's difficult to assess his unrealized potential; he was only 17 at the time of his death, and had just barely begun to make records. Nevertheless, Valens' music has endured for decades.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/ritchie-valens-p133797/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/ritchie-valens-p133797/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-richie-valens-emi-capitol-special-markets-r1935876&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-richie-valens-emi-capitol-special-markets-r1935876&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000257BK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000257BK&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
