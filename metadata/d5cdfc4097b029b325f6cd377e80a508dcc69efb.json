Formed in the late 1970s, they are one of the longest-running and most prolific of the first-wave British punk rock bands. Through the years, the band's musical style has evolved, incorporating aspects of country music, folk music, alternative rock and even occasional experiments with dub. These days, The Mekons are often described as a post-punk, cowpunk and/or alt country band.\n\nAllMusic: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-mekons-mn0000399895&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-mekons-mn0000399895&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Quality of Mercy is Not Strnen (1979)\nThe English Dancing Master [EP] (1983)\nPunk Rock (2004)\n\n\n1979 - The Quality of Mercy is Not Strnen\n \t\n01.
