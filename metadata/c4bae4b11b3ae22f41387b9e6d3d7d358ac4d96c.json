The audio version of Attaining the Worlds Beyond allows you to absorb the ultimate fulfillment of moving spiritual content in plain English wherever you happen to be. The poignant narration takes you on a journey that enlightens the mind, invigorates the heart, and moves you to the depths of your soul. In the words of Rav Michael Laitman, PhD, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt is beyond human comprehension to understand the essence of such spiritual qualities as total altruism and love. This is for the simple reason that human beings cannot comprehend how such feelings can exist at all, as everyone seemingly requires an incentive to perform any act; without some personal gain, people are not prepared to extend themselves. That is why a quality such as altruism can only be imparted to a person from Above, and only those who have experienced it can understand it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ So sit back and let the wisdom of Kabbalah wash over you. Encountering the perfection of infinity in such a compelling manner is an experience that cannot be described with words; it must be felt by each individual, each at their own pace. This comprehensive guide to spiritual discovery is intended for all those who seek true meaning in life that is far beyond the ordinary.\n\nThe music used in recordings was written by Baal Hasulam (Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag): Yedid Nefesh and Kel Mistater (downloadable from Melodies by Baal HaSulam).\n\nArranged by: A. Ettinger / T. Kosinec at Thinkmusic Studio, Toronto, Canada\nNarration and Production: T. Kosinec\n\n42 mp3 files and 1 eBook\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4bae4b11b3ae22f41387b9e6d3d7d358ac4d96c","amp;dn":"Kabbalah+-+Attaining+the+Worlds+Beyond+-+Book+%26+Audio+Book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4bae4b11b3ae22f41387b9e6d3d7d358ac4d96c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,186,228,177,27,58,226,47,65,56,123,158,109,61,125,53,138,196,217,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
