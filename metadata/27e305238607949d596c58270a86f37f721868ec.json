Hitherto their collaborations had been infrequent and ultra-spontaneous. Both had maintained positions in conventional bands but needed to trade the constraints of the &quot;write - rehearse - gig - record&quot; treadmill for a more fluent, and ultimately enjoyable approach. A nursery period for a music culled from sonic experiments and ideas quickly put to tape emerged. A treatment of all sounds as &quot;objet trouvÃƒÂ©&quot; and a hobbyist attitude prevailed.\n\nWhen Dave Brennand a.k.a. Porky heard a piece composed on a wet Wednesday, he asked to release it. They happily agreed. As previous unreleased work hadn't warranted anything but comedy monickers - &quot;Dada Black Sheep&quot; being one - a name was needed. At that time the media's &quot;killer dog frenzy&quot; was in full swing and a breed known as the fila brasiliero was the subject of a debate in the Commons. This was misheard on the radio by Steve, proposed and accepted for the single and eventually the name stuck. The track &quot;Mermaids&quot;, was Fila Brazillia's first single, released in Spring 1991, and marked the beginning of a decade which saw Fila yield seven highly acclaimed albums and a skip-full of singles on Pork Recordings and over 60 remixes.&quot;\n\nSteve Cobby's current projects (2009) include establishing Steel Tiger Records with Sim Lister; home to J*S*T*A*R*S and The Cutler (Cobby collaborations with Lister and Porky).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://23online.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://23online.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://steeltiger.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://steeltiger.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(Please support the artists if you like this amazing music!) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFila Brazillia Discography + Remix/DJset albums (Size: 1.68 GB)\n  \tAnother Fine Mess\n  \tAnother Late Night\n  \tA Touch of Cloth\n  \tB2\n  \tBlack Market Gardening\n  \tBrazilification (Remixes 95-99)\n  \tDicks\n  \tJump Leads\n  \tLuck Be A Weirdo Tonight\n  \tMaim That Tune\n  \tMess\n  \tOld Codes New Chaos\n  \tPower Clown\n  \tThe Life and Times of Phoebus Brumal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27e305238607949d596c58270a86f37f721868ec","amp;dn":"Fila+Brazillia+Discog+%2B+Remix%2FDJset+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27e305238607949d596c58270a86f37f721868ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,227,5,35,134,7,148,157,89,108,88,39,10,134,243,127,114,24,104,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
