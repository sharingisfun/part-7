Unfortunately, and as is often the way with such things, the quality of proper songwriting practised by the likes of Weezer got diluted by the onslaught of the Blink 182&amp;#039;s of the world. Fortunately--and finally--Wheatus are on the case. Sure, they&amp;#039;re playing adolescent brat-pop. But they do it so well. The songs are quick of tempo and short of length (the entire album clocks in at just under 35 minutes), and--most importantly--they&amp;#039;re great. Hit single &quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot; is a perfect example of what first made this scene so much fun: it&amp;#039;s a catchy tune with witty lyrics, the music itself is clever (it starts with scratching and has some organ scattered about) and it sounds best loud. In fact, the same thing could be said of the majority of Wheatus, especially songs like &quot;Sunshine&quot; (yep, that&amp;#039;s a banjo heard near the end) and the ska-influenced bounce of &quot;Truffles&quot;. The only time Wheatus really stumble (apart from when they chose their name) is on the uninspired cover of Erasure&amp;#039;s &quot;Little Respect&quot;. Had they stuck solely with their own songs, this could have been as near perfect an album as any geek-rockers have produced.\n\nEnjoy! :) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4eb86dad09921460795485cc7f1fc987330cd32","amp;dn":"Wheatus+-+Wheatus+%5BSelf-Titled%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4eb86dad09921460795485cc7f1fc987330cd32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,235,134,218,208,153,33,70,7,149,72,92,199,241,252,152,115,48,205,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
