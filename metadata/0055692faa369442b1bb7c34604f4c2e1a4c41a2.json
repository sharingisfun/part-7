That didn't stop them from releasing greatest-hits albums, however, nor did it stop the inevitable wave of '80s nostalgia that surged forth in the '90s. To cash in on whatever meager Frankie nostalgia that may have existed, Bang!... Greatest Hits of Frankie Goes to Hollywood appeared in 1994 and was reissued in 1998, when the rights shifted to Universal Records. Bang! is as good a compilation of Frankie's material as could be assembled, featuring no less than eight songs from Pleasuredome (including, of course, &quot;Relax,&quot; &quot;Two Tribes,&quot; &quot;The World Is My Oyster,&quot; and &quot;Bang&quot;) and five songs from Liverpool. There were a couple of good songs stranded on the second album (&quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey,&quot; &quot;Rage Hard&quot;) and certain casual fans may enjoy having those singles on the same disc with the hits, but the fact remains that Frankie can only truly be understood (and, to a certain extent, truly enjoyed) on Pleasuredome. That debut stood on its own, sounding unlike any other record of its time, and it contained all of the big hits in the first place. Consequently, many casual listeners will be satisfied with simply acquiring that record, even if the album versions were slightly different than the singles. If they feel otherwise, Bang! will serve as the definitive singles collection, satisfying both the hardcore and casual fan.\nAll Music Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Relax\n[02] Two Tribes\n[03] War\n[04] Ferry Cross The Mersey\n[05] Warriors Of The Wasteland\n[06] For Heaven's Sake\n[07] The World Is My Oyster\n[08] Welcome To The Pleasuredome\n[09] Watching The Wildlife\n[10] Born To Run\n[11] Rage Hard\n[12] The Power Of Love\n[13] Bang\n\nPlay Time - 01h:00m:07s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 150mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
