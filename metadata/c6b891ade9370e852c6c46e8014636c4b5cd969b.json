Eventually, he was caught in an explosion initiated by his archnemesis, Cod Commando. The explosion scattered most of his body across the world. He was rescued by a scientist, the begoggled and curvaceous Major Dr. Ghastly who has a crush on him, who placed his living remains into two containment units: one for his brain, and the other for his stomach. These two units were later installed into Boskov, a purple circus bear, giving Con Carne&amp;#039;s brain control over (almost) all of the bear&amp;#039;s actions and movements. Hector, Dr. Ghastly and his military leader, General Skarr, then created a secret laboratory on an island with a bunny-shaped mountain (apparently a spoof of Blofeld&amp;#039;s lair in the James Bond movies, or a spoof of Easter Island). Gathering an army, Con Carne resumed his quest for world domination and made a new goal: to find his missing body parts.\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Con_Carne\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419322/\n\nCreator: Maxwell Atoms (creator of the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy)\nDirectors: Julie Hashiguchi, Phil Cummings, Robert Hughes.\nWriters: Greg Ellis, Maxwell Atoms, C.H.

The reason is because it is the exact same episode as S1E09a, and I didn&amp;#039;t want to have two identical copies of the same file in the torrent - it would be wasteful of bandwidth. Also, the audio correction was a missing left speaker channel for the episode S1E06B - The Time Hole Incident. Enjoy!]\n\nThis torrent is a part of Operation: Massive Information Leak, Wave Two.\nBloodLogic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6b891ade9370e852c6c46e8014636c4b5cd969b","amp;dn":"Evil+Con+Carne+-+Seasons+1-2+%2B+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6b891ade9370e852c6c46e8014636c4b5cd969b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,184,145,173,233,55,14,133,44,108,70,232,1,70,54,196,181,205,150,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
