They rape Chato's woman, and are hunted down to the last man by the unrelenting warrior.\n\ninfo on Bronson\n\nThis film is one of Charles Bronson's 70s westerns. His westerns made during the 1970s include Chino, Red Sun, Chato's Land, From Noon Till Three, Breakheart Pass and The White Buffalo.\n\nUser Review\n\nChato's Land&quot; was well suited to Bronson's evolutionary screen persona, that of the strong, relatively silent avengerÃ¢â‚¬â€a solid figure of firm intention but few wordsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nAs Pardon Chato, the vengeful Apache half-breed, Bronson enjoyed the most vocally reticent role of his starring career, speaking but few linesÃ¢â‚¬â€and most of those in Apache!\n\nAgain, Spanish locations represented the American frontier West for this post-Civil War tale about a white posse's search for Chato, who, in self-defense, had killed the sheriff of a small New Mexico townÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ As the pursuers forge deeper into Apache country, the situation shifts around, with hunters becoming the huntedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Failing out among themselves, the posse members gradually become victim either to each other's violence or to Chato's well-justified vengeance, after they rape his womanÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nIn the non-U.S. countries where Bronson enjoyed his greatest popularity, &quot;Chato's Land&quot; was well met and highly successfulÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8c174ca6236faeb492ff23868a740aecec719d7","amp;dn":"Chato%27s+Land+%28Western%29+%7BBronson%2C+Palance%2C+Whitmore%7D+%5B1974","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8c174ca6236faeb492ff23868a740aecec719d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,193,116,202,98,54,250,235,73,47,242,56,104,167,64,174,206,199,25,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
