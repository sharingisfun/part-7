Carl Boese &amp; Paul Wegener\n\nreview from IMDB:\n&quot;The Golem&quot; is the perfect companion piece for &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.&quot; \nBoth are excellent examples of German expressionism.\nPay attention to the surrealist sets and lighting.\nThis is skilled film-making, and today's directors can well learn from \nclassics such as these.\nHowever, do not confuse this with an earlier film of the same title. That \nearlier film is considered lost.\n\n\nXvid DVDrip.\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AT LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...
