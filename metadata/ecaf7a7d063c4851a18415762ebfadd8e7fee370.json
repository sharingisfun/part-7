Emerging from the musical hotbed of Dayton in 1959, the group was originally dubbed the Ohio Untouchables, and initially comprised singer/guitarist Robert Ward, bassist Marshall &quot;Rock&quot; Jones, saxophonist/guitarist Clarence &quot;Satch&quot; Satchell, drummer Cornelius Johnson, and trumpeter/trombonist Ralph &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Middlebrooks. In late 1961, a relative of Ward's founded the Detroit-based Lupine Records, and the group traveled north to the Motor City to back the Falcons on their hit &quot;I Found a Love&quot;; the Ohio Untouchables soon made their headlining debut with &quot;Love Is Amazing,&quot; but when Ward subsequently exited for a solo career, the group essentially disbanded. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Skin Tight\n02.Jive Turkey\n03.Heaven Must Be Like This\n04.Fire\n05.Together\n06.I Want To Be Free\n07.It's All Over\n08.Piano Ballad (Just Right)\n09.Fopp\n10.Sweet Sticky Thing\n11.Love Rollercoaster\n12.Honey\n13.There It Is\n14.Happy Holidays, Pts. 1 &amp; 2\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Who'd She Coo\n02.Bi-Centennial\n03.Far East Mississippi\n04.Only A Child Can Love\n05.Angel\n06.O-H-I-O\n07.Body Vibes\n08.Alone\n09.Good Luck Charm\n10.Funk-O-Nots\n11.Time Slips Away\n12.Shady Lady\n13.Wonderful\n14.More Than Love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n                 \n                   ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecaf7a7d063c4851a18415762ebfadd8e7fee370","amp;dn":"Ohio+Players+-+Funk+Anthology+2CD+%281995%29+%5B320%5D+vtwin88ucbe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecaf7a7d063c4851a18415762ebfadd8e7fee370","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,175,122,125,6,60,72,81,161,132,21,118,46,191,173,216,231,254,227,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
