(from bio-weapons)\n\nAnswer: It is best to have a good supply of antibiotics on hand. Tetracycline or oxytetracycline is very effective against anthrax, if you are able to start using it before you contract a serious infection from these biological agents. This means to start using it the moment you know of a germ warfare attack against your area ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nQuestion: What about natural substances? Are there any that can help protect you?\n\nAnswer: The only natural substance I know of that is effective against these microbes is colloidal silver. I tested that myself when I was with the CIA, and found it effective against both anthrax and the bubonic plague pathogen....\n\n\n\nsource: http://www.stickman-escrima.com/NYC/biologist.htm\n\n\n----------------\n\n\n\nA Brief History of The Health Support Uses of Silver\n\nFor thousands of years silver has been used as a healing and anti-bacterial agent by civilizations throughout the world. Its medical, preservative and restorative powers can be traced as far back as the ancient Greek and Roman Empires. Long before the development of modern pharmaceuticals, silver was employed as a germicide and antibiotic.\n\nConsider these interesting facts:\n\nThe Greeks used silver vessels to keep water and other liquids fresh. The writings of Herodotus, the Greek philosopher and historian, date the use of silver to before the birth of Christ.\nThe Roman Empire stored wine in silver urns to prevent spoilage.\nThe use of silver is mentioned in ancient Egyptian writings.\nIn the Middle Ages, silverware protected the wealthy from the full brunt of the plague.\nBefore the advent of modern germicides and antibiotics, it was known that disease-causing pathogens could not survive in the presence of silver. Consequently, silver was used in dishware, drinking vessels and eating utensils.\nIn particular, the wealthy stored and ate their food from silver vessels to keep bacteria from growing.\nThe Chinese emperors and their courts ate with silver chopsticks.\nThe Druids have left evidence of their use of silver.\nSettlers in the Australian outback suspend silverware in their water tanks to retard spoilage.\nPioneers trekking across the American West found that if they placed silver or copper coins in their casks of drinking water, it kept the water safe from bacteria, algae, etc.\nAll along the frontier, silver dollars were put in milk to keep it fresh. Some of us remember our grandparents doing the same.\nSilver leaf was used to combat infection in wounds sustained by troops during World War I.\nPrior to the introduction of antibiotics, Colloidal Silver was used widely in hospitals and has been known as a bactericide for at least 1200 years.\nIn the early 1800s, doctors used silver sutures in surgical wounds with very successful results.\nIn Ayurvedic medicine, silver is used in small amounts as a tonic, elixir or rejuvenative agent for patients debilitated by age or disease.\nSilver Re-Discovered\nNot until the late 1800's did western scientists re-discover what had been known for thousands of years - that silver is a powerful germ fighter. Medicinal silver compounds were then developed and silver became commonly used as a medicine. By the early part of the 1900s, the use of silver as an antibacterial substance was becoming widespread. By 1940 there were approximately four dozen different silver compounds on the market being used to treat every known infectious disease. These were available in oral, injectable, and topical forms.\n\nAlthough there were a few flare-ups of negative publicity regarding medicinal silver in the early 1900s, (due to the overuse of certain types of protein-bound silver compounds causing a discoloration of the skin called argyria and due to a supply of improperly prepared and unstable silver) reputable medical journal reports demonstrated that a properly prepared colloidal dispersion of silver was completely suitable with no adverse side effects. T. H. Anderson Wells reported in the Lancet (February 16th, 1918) that a preparation of colloidal silver was &quot;used intravenously. . . without any irritation of the kidneys and with no pigmentation of the skin. &quot;\n\nNew knowledge of body chemistry gave rise to the enormous array of applications for colloidal disinfectants and medicines and for on-going research into the capabilities and possibilities for silver colloids. However, SilverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnew-foundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ fame as a superior infection-fighting agent was short lived.\n\nHow Silver Lost Favor\nDuring the 1930s, synthetically manufactured drugs began to make their appearance and the profits, together with the simplicities of manufacturing this new source of treatment, became a powerful force in the marketplace. There was much excitement over the new 'wonder drugs' and at that time, no antibiotic-resistant strains of disease organisms had surfaced. Silver quickly lost its status to modern antibiotics.\n\nOn-going Uses of Colloidal Silver\nThe use of some silver preparations in mainstream medicine survived. Among them are the use of dilute silver nitrate in newborn babies' eyes to protect from infection and the use of &quot;Silvadine,&quot; a silver based salve, in virtually every burn ward in America to kill infection. A new silver based bandage has recently been approved by the FDA and licensed for sale. Other uses that did not lose favor include:\n\nSilver water purification filters and tablets are manufactured in Switzerland and used by many national and international airlines to prevent growth of algae and bacteria.\nElectrical ionization units that impregnate the water with silver and copper ions are used to sanitize pool water without the harsh effects of chlorine. \nThe former Soviet Union used silver to sterilize recycled water on their space vehicles. \nThe Swiss use silver filters in homes and offices.\nSome U.S. municipalities use silver in treatment of sewage. \nIn the Japanese work place, silver is a popular agent in the fight against airborne toxins as well other industrial poisons.\nSilver-infused bandages and wound dressings are now commercially available. \nSilver has been found to prevent the infection resulting from burns.\nBut for the most part, with the discovery of pharmaceutical antibiotics, interest in silver as an anti-microbial agent declined almost to the point of extinction.\n\nThe Resurgence of Silver in Medicine\nThe return of silver to conventional medicine began in the 1970s. The late Dr. Carl Moyer, chairman of Washington University's Department of Surgery, received a grant to develop better methods of treatment for burn victims. Dr. Margraf, as the chief biochemist, worked with Dr. Moyer and other surgeons to find an antiseptic strong enough, yet safe to use over large areas of the body. Dr. Margraf investigated 22 antiseptic compounds and found drawbacks in all of them.\n\nReviewing earlier medical literature, Dr. Margraf found continual references to the use of silver. However, since concentrated silver nitrate is both corrosive and painful, he diluted the silver to a .5 percent solution and found that it killed invasive burn bacteria and permitted wounds to heal. Importantly, resistant strains did not appear. But, silver nitrate was far from ideal. So research continued for more suitable silver preparations.\n\nSilver sulphadiazine (Silvadene, Marion Laboratories) is now used in 70 percent of burn centers in America. Discovered by Dr. Charles Fox of Columbia University, sulphadiazine has also been successful in treating cholera, malaria and syphilis. It also stops the herpes virus, which is responsible for cold sores, shingles and worse.\n\nResults show Colloidal Silver to be highly germicidal, yet harmless and non-toxic to humans. More importantly, research shows excellent results with an astonishing array of bacterial, viral and fungal conditions.\n\nColloidal Silver: Expert Opinions\nBecause of the research showing colloidal silver's superior performance in fighting microbes, it has attracted the attention of leading scientists and medical researchers throughout the world. Its benefits are now stirring new interest as 50 prominent doctors are currently researching the efficacy and applications of colloidal silver in human health. As a result, many interesting studies have emerged.\n\nAccording to experts, no microorganism ever tested has been able to stay alive for more than six minutes when exposed directly to colloidal silver.\n\nScience Digest cites colloidal silver as &quot;...a wonder of modern medicine,&quot; and further states &quot;Antibiotics kill perhaps a half dozen different disease organisms, but silver kills hundreds. Resistant strains fail to develop. Moreover, silver is virtually non-toxic. Colloidal silver, used as an anti-microbial agent, will not create super bugs as antibiotics do.&quot;\n\nAlfred Searle, founder of the giant Searle Pharmaceuticals (now Monsanto) stated, &quot;Applying colloidal silver to human subjects has been done in a large number of cases with astonishingly successful results. For internal administration ... it has the advantage being rapidly fatal to pathogens without toxic action on its host. It is quite stable.&quot; Further information indicates that Colloidal Silver does not cause harmful interactions with other medications or topical treatments.\n\nIn laboratory tests with colloidal silver, bacteria, viruses, and fungal organisms are killed within minutes of contact. Larry C. Ford, M.D. of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, UCLA School of Medicine, Centre For The Health Sciences reported in November 1, 1988, &quot; I tested them (the silver solutions) using standard anti-microbial tests for disinfectants. The silver solutions were anti-bacterial for concentrations of 105 organisms per ml of Streptococcus Pyogenes, Staphylococcus Aureus, Neisseria Gonorrhea, Gardnerella Vaginalis, Salmonella Typhi and other enteric pathogens, and fungicidal for Candida Albicans, Candida Globata and M. Furfur.&quot;\n\nBecause of the many organisms that have developed strains resistant to modern antibiotics, Dr. Robert Becker's finding is of particular importance. Becker, of Syracuse University stated, &quot;All of the organisms that we tested were sensitive to the electrically generated silver ions, including some that were resistant to all known antibiotics...In no case were any undesirable side effects of the silver treatment apparent.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nEverything Old Is New Again\nSome researchers, such as Dr. Leonard Keene Hirschberg, A.M., M.D. of Johns Hopkins, believe that the potential of colloidal silver is just beginning to be discovered. Unlike antibiotics, which are specific only to bacteria, Colloidal Silver disables certain enzymes needed by anaerobic bacteria, viruses, yeasts, and fungus resulting in the destruction of these enzymes. Further indication is that these bacteria cannot develop a resistance to silver, as they do with antibiotics, because silver attacks their food source, rather than them directly\n\nIn fact, Colloidal Silver is experiencing a well-deserved resurgence in use and research, proving once again the old adage that &quot;There's nothing new under the sun.&quot;\n\n\n\nsource: http://www.purestcolloids.com/history-silver.php\n\n\n-------------\n\n\n&quot;Big Phama failed to get colloidal silver banned by the FDA back in 1999, succeeding only in having the FDA ban the mention of silverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s powerful antibiotic qualities from product advertising and labeling.\n\nOf course, that backfired on them. The FDAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 1999 'Final Ruling' on colloidal silver only served to incense the public about bureaucratic meddling in their health care choices. As a direct result of the anger generated by the FDAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 'Final Ruling,' more people today know about and regularly use colloidal silver than ever before.\n\nSo now they are trying to restrict colloidal silver by using paid shills within the environmental movement to promote the spurious idea that 'nanosilver is harmful to the environment.'ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\nsource:\n\n\n-------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb361abe2eb4988246e77043b058cb9cf9a4e51c","amp;dn":"Colloidal+Silver+as+a+Germicide+and+Antibiotic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb361abe2eb4988246e77043b058cb9cf9a4e51c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,54,26,190,46,180,152,130,70,231,112,67,176,88,203,156,249,164,229,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
