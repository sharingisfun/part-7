Indeed, through a clever use of a very focused part of the timeline--the whole run seems to happen in or about the year 5 ABY--all 35 issues serve as a kind of &quot;prequel&quot; to the novels.\nAlmost the entire run was collected by individual story. Oddly, though, the first story, &quot;The Rebel Opposition&quot;, was never traded on its own, and only made its first appearance in collected form in May 2006. The trade series, Star Wars Omnibus, collected Rogue Squadron again--this time with about three storylines per book--for a whole new generation of fans.\n\nThe title has the distinction of being Dark Horse's first attempt at an ongoing Star Wars comic--even though it still kinda feels like a &quot;series of miniseries&quot;, as they had done previously with their Star Wars license. Indeed, if you go by strict cover numbering, the first 20 issues are actually five separate 4-issue miniseries. Although they aren't numbered on the cover as an ongoing series, they do have such a marking in the indicia. It isn't until issue #21 that the indicia numbering is reflected on the cover of the issues. The database, as a result, uses the indicia numbering for consistency.\n\nNumber of issues: 35 (COMPLETE!)\nFiles format: CBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a38432d9b866bab924b7a900e273801c23e46900","amp;dn":"Star+Wars%3A+X-Wing+Rogue+Squadron+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a38432d9b866bab924b7a900e273801c23e46900","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,132,50,217,184,102,186,185,36,183,169,0,226,115,128,28,35,228,105,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
