Andrews\n\nPublication Date: December 10, 1999\nISBN-10: 0201357526\nISBN-13: 978-0201357523\nEdition: 1\nLanguage: english\n\nFoundations of Multithreaded, Parallel, and Distributed Programming covers, and then applies, the core concepts and techniques needed for an introductory course in this subject. Its emphasis is on the practice and application of parallel systems, using real-world examples throughout. Greg Andrews teaches the fundamental concepts of multithreaded, parallel and distributed computing and relates them to the implementation and performance processes. He presents the appropriate breadth of topics and supports these discussions with an emphasis on performance.\n\n\n\nSEED AND KEEP FREE KNOWLEDGE ALIVE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39e66ad06f6e027dba8125cf0c389568437a1357","amp;dn":"Foundations+of+Multithreaded%2C+Parallel%2C+and+Distributed+Programm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39e66ad06f6e027dba8125cf0c389568437a1357","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,230,106,208,111,110,2,125,186,129,37,207,12,56,149,104,67,122,19,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
