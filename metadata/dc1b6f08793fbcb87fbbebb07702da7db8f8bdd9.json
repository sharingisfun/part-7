But when she unwittingly attracts the ire of the Witch of the Waste, Sophie finds herself under a horrid spell that transforms her into an old lady. Her only chance at breaking it lies in the ever-moving castle in the hills: the Wizard Howl's castle. To untangle the enchantment, Sophie must handle the heartless Howl, strike a bargain with a fire demon, and meet the Witch of the Waste head-on. Along the way, she discovers that there's far more to HowlÃ¢â‚¬â€and herselfÃ¢â‚¬â€than first meets the eye.\n\nHowl's Moving Castle was first published in 1986 by Greenwillow Books of New York. It was a runner-up for the annual Boston GlobeÃ¢â‚¬â€œHorn Book Award and it won the Phoenix Award twenty years later, recognizing its rise from relative obscurity. In 2004 it was adapted as an animated film of the same name, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc1b6f08793fbcb87fbbebb07702da7db8f8bdd9","amp;dn":"Howl%27s+Moving+Castle+%28Castle+01%29+-+Diana+Wynne+Jones+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc1b6f08793fbcb87fbbebb07702da7db8f8bdd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,27,111,8,121,63,188,184,127,187,235,176,119,2,218,125,184,248,189,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
