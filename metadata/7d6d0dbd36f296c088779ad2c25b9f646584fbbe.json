Simply by designing your product the right way, you can build a flourishing business from scratch. No advertising or marketing budget, no need for a sales force, and venture capitalists will flock to throw money at you.\n\nMany of the most successful Web 2.0 companies, including MySpace, YouTube, eBay, and rising stars like Twitter and Flickr, are prime examples of what journalist Adam L. Penenberg calls a &quot;viral loop&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€to use it, you have to spread it. After all, what's the sense of being on Facebook if none of your friends are The result: Never before has there been the potential to create wealth this fast, on this scale, and starting with so little.\n\nIn this game-changing must-read, Penenberg tells the fascinating story of the entrepreneurs who first harnessed the unprecedented potential of viral loops to create the successful online businessesÃ¢â‚¬â€some worth billions of dollarsÃ¢â‚¬â€that we have all grown to rely on. The trick is that they created something people really want, so much so that their customers happily spread the word about their product for them.\n\nAll kinds of businessesÃ¢â‚¬â€from the smallest start-ups to nonprofit organizations to the biggest multinational corporationsÃ¢â‚¬â€can use the paradigm-busting power of viral loops to enable their business through technology. Viral Loop is a must-read for any entrepreneur or business interested in uncorking viral loops to benefit their bottom line.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nPublishers Weekly\nAllen's powerful voice and thoughtful vocals are the perfect medium to relay Penenberg's pronouncements about how such Web 2.0 businesses as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Flickr are reconfiguring marketing models and the road to wealthÃ¢â‚¬â€and how the mechanisms driving the growth of user-driven technologies are nothing new (remember Tupperware parties?). It's a snappy, topical read made even more memorable by Allen's performance: his vocal range is wide, but he wisely scales back his intensity to command our attention with his sheer charisma.
