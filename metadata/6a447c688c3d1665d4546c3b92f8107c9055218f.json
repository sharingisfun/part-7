Why it happened? To be honest, I have no idea. I don&amp;#039;t recall modifying any file after releasing v3.0 and my computer did not behave in any suspicious way, perhaps it is simply a problem with the hash when the torrent was created, but one sure thing is that a few files such as this file, Wolverine #088 and Deadpool &amp; Widdle Wade were impossible to download and a whole bunch of people were stuck at 99.99%.\n\nIf you are one of those person unable to complete Deadpool Collection v3.0, here is what to do:\n1. Make sure you keep all the files you downloaded from Deadpool Collection v3.0.\n2. Remove the Deadpool Collection v3.0 torrent from your active torrents in your torrent client.\n3. Rename the folder &quot;Deadpool Collection v3.0&quot; to &quot;Deadpool Collection&quot; with no version number.\n4. Download the Deadpool Collection v3.1 torrent from Demonoid.\n5. Open the Deadpool Collection v3.1 torrent with your torrent client and save it where your Deadpool Collection folder is located.\n\nThe torrent should automatically check for completed files, skipping the files you already have and only downloading the few missing files.\n\n\n------------------\nWhat&amp;#039;s new in v3.0\n------------------\n-Complete Cable &amp; Deadpool series from issue #001 to #050\n-Added Deadpool GLI Summer Fun Spectacular\n-Added 17 new and old appearances\n-Fixed two reading order mistakes in the 4. Deadpool folder\n-Fixed a few title errors\n-Re-arranged a little bit the folder structure\n---&gt; See Folder Structure and Download Instructions section for more information\n-Corrected a bunch of spelling mistakes in this file (looks like my English has improved)\n-Torrent created with Transmission on Mac OS X Leopard\n\n\n-------------------------\nAppearances added in v3.0\n-------------------------\nBlack Panther v3 #022 \nNomad v2 #004 \nWhite Tiger #005\nWolverine Annual &amp;#039;95\nWolverine Annual &amp;#039;99\nWolverine #088\nWolverine #154 and #155\nWolverine Origins #020 to #025\nX-Force v2 #004 and #005\nX-Men Unlimited #028\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nI went through every single file, one by one, to make sure that\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n-Every scan is complete\n-There is no corrupted image/file (I either fixed the error or re-downloaded another scan)\n-Deadpool did appear in the issue\n\n\n--------------------------\nI also took the liberty to\n--------------------------\n-Removed the nfo/txt file present in some scans as they are now outdated anyway\n-Removed most adds from the scans\n---&gt; Why? This collection will get bigger over time and size is a matter for some people. The size of this current release is already 2.2 GB and if removing of couple of adds, that are anyway irrelevant to the story, can help reducing the size of this and the next release, then I say CHIMICHANGA!\n\n\n------------------------------------\nDeadpool Collection v3.1 description\n------------------------------------\n0. No Order:\nIssues and series featuring Deadpool as one of the main character that either happen in an alternate Marvel universe or do not affect the main story line. Hence, they are safe to read at anytime in no particular order.\n\n1. New Mutants:\nDeadpool&amp;#039;s first appearance. Not really story relevant, but it is always good to read it first.\n\n2. Limited Series #1 - The Circle Chase:\nDeadpool&amp;#039;s first own series, introducing Weasel and Copy Cat to the main story line.\n\n3. Limited Series #2 - Sins Of The Past:\nDeadpool&amp;#039;s second own series, introducing Siryn to the main story line.\n\n4. Deadpool:\nDeadpool&amp;#039;s first title including all the annuals and extras.\n\n5. Taskmaster:\nNot featuring Deadpool, but follow up of the story left by Deadpool.\n\n6. Agent-X:\nExplains what happened to Deadpool after Deadpool #69.\n\n7. Cable &amp; Deadpool:\nDeadpool&amp;#039;s second title co-featuring Cable.\n\nOne Shots:\n-Encyclopaedia Deadpoolica\n---&gt; A guide to Deadpool, came out after Deadpool #022\n-Deadpool &amp; Widdle Wade\n---&gt; Marvel Team-Ups\n-Deadpool GLI Summer Fun Spectacular\n---&gt; GOD NO!\n\nComplete list of appearances present in this version:\n-Avengers\n-Black Panther\n-Contest of Champions II\n-Earth X\n-Exiles\n-Gambit\n-Heroes for Hire\n-Heroes Reborn\n-Identity Disc\n-J2\n-New Warriors\n-Nomad\n-Secret Defenders\n-Silver Sable &amp; The Wild Pack\n-Ultimate Spider-Man\n-Weapon X\n-Webspinners Tales of Spider-Man\n-What If&amp;#039;s\n-White Tiger\n-Wolverine\n-Wolverine Origins\n-X-Calibre Age of Apocalypse\n-X-Force\n-X-Men Unlimited\n\n\n------------------------------------------\nFolder Structure and Download Instructions\n------------------------------------------\nThe folder structure for version 3.1 is the same as version 3.0 and really similar to version 2.0. The only folder that was changed is the Appearances folder, which will be now keep that way for future releases. From now on, every appearance will be put in a title folder named according to the generic title of the issue. For example, both Wolverine Origins and Wolverine v2 will be found in the Wolverine folder located in the Appearances folder. This will avoid cluttering the Appearances folder and giving easy and simple reference points for all appearances. Moreover, the Deadpool Collection folder will no longer have the version number in its name, thus making it even easier for you to download future versions.\n\nIf you already have any version of Deadpool Collection, what I recommend doing for downloading this version is to first remove the Appearances folder, then rename the main folder to &quot;Deadpool Collection&quot; and then save this torrent where your former folder is located. Why? Aside from the Appearances folder and a few fixed files, most of the files in this version are either new files or the same old files present in the last version. Thus, if you simply save this version over the last one and you did not change the name of the files/folders inside the main folder, your torrent client should inspect the files you already have and skip them in order to only download the new files added. This operation will be much faster than downloading the whole torrent and it will be made even more user friendly for future releases. You will also save on bandwidth.\n\n\n---------\nThanks to\n---------\n-SlappyMcGee\n---&gt; Thank you my fellow Canadian Demonoid user for helping me finding the last few appearances I was looking for. Without you this release wouldn&amp;#039;t be complete.\n-All the scanners\n---&gt; You are the real people we should thanks for investing time and efforts into scanning all these comics for free and rendering them available for everyone.\n\n\n-------\nFinally\n-------\nI might have forgotten some appearances or did not see a few glitches/errors, so please let me know.
