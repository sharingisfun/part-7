Mario and Karen Constantinides have found it impossible to find a new head chef to help them transform their menu from good pub grub to a destination restaurant. They've now turned to Alex for help to find the right person.\n\nIn this episode, the first three candidates are put through a grueling hands-on interview process. A local rack of lamb immediately puts their butchery skills under scrutiny. Young pretender James flashes a 'gourmet' tattoo, but will his costings prove to be up to scratch? Laid-back Robert offers up 'three little pigs' as his signature dish, but will his relaxed attitude let him down? And ambitious Craig attempts the reinvention of a pasty, but will this intricate dish be a risk too far?\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 27-Apr-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:681c20b4b84bf93d337c9106d7561105ea933e6f","amp;dn":"Alex.Polizzi.Chefs.On.Trial.S01E05.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"681c20b4b84bf93d337c9106d7561105ea933e6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,28,32,180,184,75,249,61,51,124,145,6,215,86,17,5,234,147,62,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
