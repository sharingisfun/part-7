This course draws a roadmap for getting started with 3D printing (aka additive manufacturing), from choosing a printer to learning about 3D modeling. After surveying a variety of commercial 3D printing technologies (filament-based, laser sintering, and more), author Kacie Hultgren walks you step-by-step through a variety of 3D design tools, including 3D modeling and 3D scanning. You'll also learn how to repair designs so they're ready to print, with netfabb Studio, a 3D printing suite. This is a great course for both 3D printing novices as well as designers with existing modeling skills that want to enter the 3D printing marketplace.\nTopics include:\n\n    What is 3D printing?\n    What can you make with a 3D printer?\n    Understanding the different 3D printing technologies\n    Designing with 3D modeling and scanning\n    Creating watertight 3D designs\n    Repairing a 3D file\n    Exporting your file\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b408a2e5313c01e16f4b4c9bb90bf58ad9a912b1","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Up+and+Running+with+3D+Printing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b408a2e5313c01e16f4b4c9bb90bf58ad9a912b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,8,162,229,49,60,1,225,111,75,76,155,185,11,245,138,217,169,18,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
