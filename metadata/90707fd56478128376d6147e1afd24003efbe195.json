From awkward encounters with celebrities and scrambling to book the next big gig, to the day-to-day details of accidentally breaking up a handicapped manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marriage, this duo fumbles their way through life in a surprisingly endearing way. They may not have a spot on the A-List or even a publicist who knows their names, but at least they have each other. And who knows, with all of their charisma and wit caught on camera, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re sure to end up famous, even if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just barely.\n\nEpisode 1\nThe Foster sisters are quickly growing accustomed to having a camera crew chronicle their lives for the public. Sick of typical Hollywood jerks, Erin goes on a date with &quot;normal guy&quot; Jensen.\n\nSeason Starts March 18th","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90707fd56478128376d6147e1afd24003efbe195","amp;dn":"Barely+Famous+S01E01+720p+WEB-DL+x264-RKSTR+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90707fd56478128376d6147e1afd24003efbe195","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,112,127,213,100,120,18,131,118,214,20,126,26,253,36,0,62,251,225,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
