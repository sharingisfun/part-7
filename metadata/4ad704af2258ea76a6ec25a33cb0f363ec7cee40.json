The game was re-released in 2002 with Windows XP compatibility.\n\nSanitarium tells the story of Max Laughton, a man who suffers from amnesia after getting in an car accident and awakening in an asylum. As the story progresses, Max frantically tries to unveil the details of his institutionalization and the search for his own identity.\n\nThis torrent contains the version from GOG.com, which includes the following:\n\n1. A simple installer for the fully updated DRM-free version of the game.\n2. A 30 page manual for the game, in PDF format.\n3. The 16 track soundtrack of the game, in MP3 format encoded at 128kbps.\n\nI have played this version all the way through on a 32-bit Windows 7 without encountering any technical difficulties.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/gamecard/sanitarium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/gamecard/sanitarium&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ad704af2258ea76a6ec25a33cb0f363ec7cee40","amp;dn":"Sanitarium+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ad704af2258ea76a6ec25a33cb0f363ec7cee40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,215,4,175,34,88,234,118,166,236,37,163,60,176,243,99,236,124,238,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
