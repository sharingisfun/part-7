Each level consists of a run from one end of a level to the flag, collecting coin-like objects called Lums on the way. As you progress through the game, Rayman will learn how to jump, fly, punch, and double-jump his way to victory. Lums arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always easy to acquire, but your job is to get as many as possible during throughout a run. If you enjoyed Rayman Jungle Run, you will love Rayman Fiesta Run and its new wacky Fiesta world! Lunge for cocktail umbrellas, leap on limes and punch those piÃƒÂ±atasÃ¢â‚¬Â¦the skyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the limit!\nDownload game, install on your Android phone, run it and game will install all files on phone. Internet connection required.\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25f327fb612c6870b7f60926e49516e3f052ac52","amp;dn":"Rayman+Fiesta+Run+1.2.5.+full.apk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25f327fb612c6870b7f60926e49516e3f052ac52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,243,39,251,97,44,104,112,183,246,9,38,228,149,22,227,240,82,172,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
