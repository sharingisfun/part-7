McKeon et al. (AOCS Press, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nIndustrial Oil Crops presents the latest information on important products derived from seed and other plant oils, their quality, the potential environmental benefit, and the latest trends in industrial uses. This book provides a comprehensive view of key oil crops that provide products used for fuel, surfactants, paints and coatings, lubricants, high-value polymers, safe plasticizers and numerous other products, all of which compete effectively with petroleum-derived products for quality and cost. Specific products derived from oil crops are a principle concern, and other fundamental aspects of developing oil crops for industrial uses are also covered. These include improvement through traditional breeding, and molecular, tissue culture and genetic engineering contributions to breeding, as well as practical aspects of what is needed to bring a new or altered crop to market. As such, this book provides a handbook for developing products from renewable resources that can replace those currently derived from petroleum. Led by an international team of expert editors, this book will be a valuable asset for those in product research and development as well as basic plant research related to oil crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUp-to-date review of all the key oilseed crops used primarily for industrial purposes\r\nHighlights the potential for providing renewable resources to replace petroleum derived products\r\nComprehensive chapters on biodiesel and polymer chemistry of seed oil\r\nIncludes chapters on economics of new oilseed crops, emerging oilseed crops, genetic modification and plant tissue culture technology for oilseed improvement","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:567a3aab074f859335b1de84dae75b0211515dea","amp;dn":"Industrial+Oil+Crops+-+Thomas+A.+McKeon+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"567a3aab074f859335b1de84dae75b0211515dea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,122,58,171,7,79,133,147,53,177,222,132,218,231,91,2,17,81,93,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
