The band adopted a sleeker approach on the brilliant Smother, so the lean synth pop that provides Present Tense's backbone feels like a logical, if not exactly expected, progression. With the help of producers Lexx and Leo Abrahams -- who have worked with BjÃƒÂ¶rk and Brian Eno, respectively -- the group explores territory that is quieter but no less compelling than where they've been before. Present Tense's implosive sound reflects the fact that comedowns and consequences cast a longer shadow over Wild Beasts' songs than they used to.
