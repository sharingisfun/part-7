Everything is translated in it, and it is professionally done.\n\nOnce you install it you'll need to go into program files and change the folder name from &quot;STEINS;GATE&quot; to &quot;STEINSGATE&quot; since windows has a problem with semicolons in folder names. That's pretty much it. I've got a shitty internet connection so the first few people will probably download really slowly. It will help future people if you seed though, so be a good boy/girl and seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:665e18669bbc0f2031cc565e056bf2de0d17f6fd","amp;dn":"Steins%3BGate+Visual+Novel+official+english+translation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"665e18669bbc0f2031cc565e056bf2de0d17f6fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,94,24,102,155,188,15,32,49,204,86,94,5,107,242,222,13,23,246,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
