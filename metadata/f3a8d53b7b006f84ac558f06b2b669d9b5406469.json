Joining Merchant on the album, which she produced herself, are her long-time band members Gabriel Gordon (guitar), Jesse Murphy (bass), Uri Sharlin (piano &amp; accordion), and Allison Miller (drums), as well as a string quartetâ€”Scot Moore (violin), Shawn Moore (violin), Marandi Hostetter (viola), and Stanley Moore (cello)â€”plus Sharel Cassity (saxophone) and guest vocals by Simi Stone, Gail Ann Dorsey, and Elizabeth Mitchell.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatalie Merchant - Paradise Is There: The New Tigerlily Recordings\r\nLabel: Nonesuch Records\r\nFormat: WEB, 11 files FLAC, Album, 24bit 48kHz HDtracks\r\nReleased: 2015\r\nGenre: Alternative\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01.
