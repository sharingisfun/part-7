Eng Key Check Crack\n\nInfo:\n\nThere didn&amp;#039;t seem to be a key check crack out there for 1.3.1. so I took a stab at making one myself since the one for 1.3 doesn&amp;#039;t seem to work with this version.\n\nI can&amp;#039;t promise that I used the hex editor appropriately considering I don&amp;#039;t know much about cracking however I got lucky and this crack simply works for me and that&amp;#039;s all I really care about. This is the second crack that I&amp;#039;ve managed to make (by luck).\n\nI tested this with Single Player and LAN Multiplayer with the Last Man Standing Mod, both computers having the crack and never experienced any issues.\n\nIf you try playing regular multiplyer over the internet, you&amp;#039;ll still be prompted for a key and I can&amp;#039;t guarantee that a correct key will even work with this crack installed.\n\nJust unzip to your doom 3 directory and enjoy.\n\nAdded note: I will only be able to seed on the weekends because it&amp;#039;s the only time I have access to high speed internet. Also, I&amp;#039;m behind a company firewall so some may not be able to download direct from me. Just be patient!\n\n-Deathstryker","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c5ea78c5af7b08b628979bd710726fb7be192aa","amp;dn":"Doom+3+1.3.1.+Eng+Key+Check+Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c5ea78c5af7b08b628979bd710726fb7be192aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,94,167,140,90,247,176,139,98,137,121,189,113,7,38,251,123,225,146,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
