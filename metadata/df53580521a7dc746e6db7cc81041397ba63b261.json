It's messy, it's tedious and even small imperfections appear glaring when the walls and ceilings are painted. Working with Drywall gives a fresh perspective on this maligned but essential task. It goes beyond the basics of installing drywall to reveal all the secrets any homeowners needs to know to transform &quot;rocking and mudding&quot; from a chore into a true pleasure. The companion DVD takes you further still by showing taping and finishing techniques in real time so you can see exactly how the process looks when it is done right.\n\n\nBy Editors of Creative Publishing\nPublished by Creative Publishing in 2010\nEPUB, Retail, 160 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df53580521a7dc746e6db7cc81041397ba63b261","amp;dn":"Working+with+Drywall+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df53580521a7dc746e6db7cc81041397ba63b261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,83,88,5,33,167,220,116,110,109,183,204,129,4,19,151,186,99,178,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
