The population was 743 at the 2000 census. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2004 estimates, the city had a population of 757.\n\nThe geographical center of Washington County, Florida, Vernon is named for George Washington's Virginia home, Mt. Vernon. The quaint, pioneer town was also the site of a major Indian settlement. Vernon held the county seat until 1927 when the seat was moved to Chipley. The move was approved by a margin of one vote.\n\nThe city is also known for the Errol Morris documentary film Vernon, Florida (produced in 1981) highlighting the eccentricites of the people who lived there. The movie angered many residents of the city and surrounding areas who felt the documentary portrayed Vernon in a negative light.\n\nVernon, Florida is a 1981 documentary film produced and directed by Errol Morris profiling various eccentric residents living within the town of Vernon, Florida. Originally titled Nub City, this follow-up to Gates of Heaven was initially focused on residents of the Southern town who cut off their own limbs as a way to collect insurance money. After Morris' life was threatened by the subjects of the film, he re-worked Nub City into Vernon, Florida. \n\nVernon, Florida \nDirected by Errol Morris \nProduced by Errol Morris \nMusic by Claude Register \nCinematography Ned Burgess \nEditing by Brad Fuller \nDistributed by IFC Films \nRelease date(s) 1981 \nRunning time 56 min. \nLanguage English \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17cea0a89f473e5684f702af2fa63fcae6223a77","amp;dn":"Vernon%2C+Florida+%5B1981%5D+Errol+Morris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17cea0a89f473e5684f702af2fa63fcae6223a77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,206,160,168,159,71,62,86,132,247,2,175,47,166,63,202,230,34,58,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
