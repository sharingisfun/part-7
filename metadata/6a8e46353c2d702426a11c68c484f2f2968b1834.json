That shit is ridiculous.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ to, well, white chicks who wear cornrows. Combining the snarky observations and often ill-spirited rants fans have come to expect from the co-host of the much-loved podcast, Your MomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s House, Segura takes his audience on a sarcastic comedic temper tantrum as he sharply rips apart his personal obstaclesÃ¢â‚¬â€œ both real and imagined.\n\nThe Los Angeles-based, Cincinnati-bred Segura has graced the stage on Conan, has starred in his own Comedy Central Presents and has appeared on Russell Peters Presents on Showtime and Live at GothamÃ¢â‚¬â€œ as well as performing at some of the top comedy festivals in the world, hitting Montreal, Vancouver and Melbourne. So, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most definitely in a position to observe and report about culture. Hence his theory on white girls who wear a style of hairdo made famous by Snoop Dogg: Ã¢â‚¬Å“You can always tell when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in a dicey neighborhood,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Segura cautions, Ã¢â‚¬Å“when you see white girls with cornrowsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦if you ever see a white girl with cornrows, just know that she is down for whatever. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see it a lot, but where you do see it, is on prison shows.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIt seems few topics are off-limits for Segura, but despite how much he has to say about others, he knows that the best humor starts with himself (highlighted by a colorful story about being caught masturbating and a theory about his ever-degenerating ability to have decent sex) or with his family: it seems SeguraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cousin Brian thinks heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an inventor; by the comedianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s estimation, however, Ã¢â‚¬Å“heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just an asshole.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½And although Segura can be comfortably classified as critical, he does it with delightfully sardonic over tones reminiscent of Jon Lovitz, combined with a laid-back, Eugene Mirman-like pace that come together to create an hour of comedy that leaves you feeling a bit guilty (and perhaps surprised at yourself) for laughing so heartily at others.\n\n01 Intro\n02 Los Angeles Is Spanish\n03 White Girls With Cornrows\n04 Every Family Has Stupid\n05 Animal Man\n06 Ass Hats\n07 People Want to Connect\n08 Destiny\n09 Nyc\n10 Inspiration\n11 Where the Dudes At_\n12 My Downfall\n13 Caught By Strangers\n14 Confusing Words\n15 Worse At Sex\n16 Bonus_ a Mexican Story","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a8e46353c2d702426a11c68c484f2f2968b1834","amp;dn":"Tom+Segura+-+White+Girls+With+Cornrows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a8e46353c2d702426a11c68c484f2f2968b1834","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,142,70,53,60,45,112,36,38,161,28,104,196,132,242,242,150,139,24,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
