Soxx &amp; the Blue Jeans, A Christmas Gift for You From Phil Spector stands as inarguably the greatest Christmas record of all time. Spector believed he could produce a record for the holidays that would capture not only the essence of the Christmas spirit, but also be a pop masterpiece that would stand against any work these artists had already done. He succeeded on every level, with all four groups/singers recording some of their most memorable performances. This is the Christmas album by which all later holiday releases had to be judged, and it has inspired a host of imitators. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:592dab4e8ccf92eeed967c2bd21c99b2eb687190","amp;dn":"A+Christmas+Gift+for+You+from+Phil+Spector","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"592dab4e8ccf92eeed967c2bd21c99b2eb687190","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,45,171,78,140,207,146,238,237,150,124,43,210,28,153,178,235,104,113,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
