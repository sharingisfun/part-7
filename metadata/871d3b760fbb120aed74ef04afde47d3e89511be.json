By convincing users to give away valuable information about themselves in exchange for free services, firms can accrue large amounts of data at virtually no cost. Lanier calls these firms Ã¢â‚¬Å“Siren Servers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses. Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the Siren Servers concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data centers. For example, he points to GoogleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s translation algorithm, which amalgamates previous translations uploaded by people online, giving the user its best guess. The people behind the source translations receive no payment for their work, while Google profits from increased ad visibility as a powerful Siren Server. As a solution to this problem, Lanier puts forth an alternative structure to the web based on Ted NelsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Project Xanadu. He proposes a two-way linking system that would point to the source of any piece of information, creating an economy of micropayments that compensates people for original material they post to the web.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Owns_the_Future%3F&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Owns_the_Future%3F&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:871d3b760fbb120aed74ef04afde47d3e89511be","amp;dn":"Jaron+Lanier+-+Who+Owns+the+Future+-+AUDIOBOOK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"871d3b760fbb120aed74ef04afde47d3e89511be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,29,59,118,15,187,18,10,237,116,239,4,175,222,71,211,232,149,17,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
