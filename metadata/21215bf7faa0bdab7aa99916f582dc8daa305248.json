The section on fences boasts a wealth of information on building various types of fences, including rail, composite, garden, board, and picket. It also explores how to construct an effective barbed wire fence, how to use a stone wall to reinforce a wooden fence, and highlights the pros of building portable fences. Fences, Gates, and Bridges is a classic manual for anyone who wants to build their own structures for their farm, large property, or quaint backyard.\n\nBy George A.
