Within the sophisticated culture of the late Victorian period, Burne-Jones's star rose rapidly, and by the 1880s he had become the establishment artist par excellence, one of the most admired and sought-after painters in Europe. Burne-Jones, in addition to being a successful and innovative painter, was also an important force in the Arts and Crafts movement, working closely with his lifelong friend William Morris in the production of such decorative arts as ceramic tiles, stained glass, large-scale tapestries, and illustrated books to be printed at Morris's renowned Kelmscott Press. Examples of works in all these media are presented in the exhibition, with full-color and black-and-white reproductions of each of the 173 works included in the catalogue","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d6cc3bb3c46205a78e85c224edd5d64e8da553","amp;dn":"Edward+Burne+Jones+-+Victorian+Artist+Dreamer+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d6cc3bb3c46205a78e85c224edd5d64e8da553","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,214,204,59,179,196,98,5,167,142,133,194,36,237,213,214,78,141,165,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
