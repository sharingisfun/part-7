In Teeny-Tiny Mochimochi Anna Hrachovec charmed knitters with her adorable miniature Mochimochi Land creatures. In Huge + Huggable Mochimochi she gives us knitted toys with even more to love. With 20 large-scale projects, from a massive monster truck to a pirate pillow pal and a super-cute bag buddy that converts from knapsack to shoulder bag, these playful knits make wonderful gifts and whimsical decorations. Anna also explains how to size the projects up or down so the knitter can customize each piece as desired.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01dade9a9a676f132bb060ad79d997af46a08ac4","amp;dn":"Knitting+Mochimochi+%26amp%3B+Huge+Huggable+Mochimochi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01dade9a9a676f132bb060ad79d997af46a08ac4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,218,222,154,154,103,111,19,43,176,96,173,121,217,151,175,70,160,138,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
