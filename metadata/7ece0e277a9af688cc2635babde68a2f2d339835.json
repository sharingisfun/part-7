Starting with a prebuilt animation rendered from CINEMA 4D, author Rob Garrott employs industry-standard techniques, utilizing materials, lights, and the library of effects in After Effects, to enhance the project's look and feel. Exercise files accompany the course.\nTopics include:\n\n    Setting up a multi-pass render\n    Batch rendering in CINEMA 4D\n    Importing 3D elements into After Effects\n    Creating and using precomps for compositing control\n    Compositing 3D text in a dynamic 3D environment\n    Creating a glow effect using Trapcode Starglow\n    Using 3D layers to create masking effects\n    Adding a flash bulb effect with CC Light Rays\n    Adding glows and glints to type\n    Creating a 2D camera shake effect using pre-comps\n    Adding depth of field with the Lens Blur effect\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ece0e277a9af688cc2635babde68a2f2d339835","amp;dn":"CINEMA+4D%3A+Rendering+Motion+Graphics+for+After+Effects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ece0e277a9af688cc2635babde68a2f2d339835","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,206,14,39,122,154,246,136,204,38,53,186,189,230,138,47,45,51,152,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
