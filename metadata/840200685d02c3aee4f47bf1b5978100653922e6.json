Gerry Souter once more offers us the works of a brilliant artist as well as a new perspective on the artist's personality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:840200685d02c3aee4f47bf1b5978100653922e6","amp;dn":"Malevich+-+Journey+to+Infinity+%28Art+Painting+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"840200685d02c3aee4f47bf1b5978100653922e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,2,0,104,93,2,195,174,228,244,123,241,181,151,129,0,101,57,34,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
