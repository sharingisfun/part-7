Some are of them were real - some are altered into pure Legend. These legends usually had somebody doing villainous deeds. The even greater thing is that most of these were surrounded in mystery or conspiracy.\r\nMedieval Murder Mysteries uses modern thinking from historical police criminology combined with forensics and human osteologists blended with current historical ideas to try and solve what really happened all those years ago. Magnificent castles, chivalrous knights, powerful kings and queens? You'll have them. Also require dark deeds, illicit lovers, greedy nobles, mad cardinals? Look no further. They're all here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6)  The Murder of Juan Borgia \r\nNaming the worst of the Borgias is a tricky business, so great is the choice. Juan Borgia, however, is right up there at the top of the list; a spoilt, arrogant, debauched, cruel brat with hundreds of enemies who also happened to be the favourite son of Pope Alexander VI - rather better known to history as the infamous despot Rodrigo Borgia. So when Juan showed up dead in 1497, the Pope was beside himself with grief - and surrounded by a whole team of people who had the desire, the motive and the wherewithal to get rid of Juan once and for all. But which one actually did it?\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1d/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c6/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/07/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a3/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0f/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0a/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3155 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,003 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.historychannel.com.au/tv-shows/1919/medieval-murder-mysteries\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=A%20Very%20British%20Murder \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=King%20Arthur \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Edward%20VII%20-%20Prince%20of%20Pleasure \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Bloody%20Tales \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Richard%20III%20The%20King%20in%20the%20Car%20Park \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Richard%20III%3A%20The%20Princes%20in%20the%20Tower","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cda718f4a7af036cc815bfd49c6b06bc0644e353","amp;dn":"Medieval+Murder+Mysteries+Series+1+6of6+Juan+Borgia+720p+x264+AA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cda718f4a7af036cc815bfd49c6b06bc0644e353","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,167,24,244,167,175,3,108,200,21,191,212,156,107,6,188,6,68,227,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
