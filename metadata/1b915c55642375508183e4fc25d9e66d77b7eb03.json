A traumatic breakup McElwee experienced prior to filming made it difficult for him to separate personal from professional concerns, shifting the focus of the film to create a more personal story about the women in his life, love, romance, and religion. Other themes include the spectre of nuclear holocaust in the context of the Cold War and the legacy and complexity of General Sherman's own life.\n\n\nThis is an excellent example of cinema verite/direct cinema. \n\nEnjoy and thanks for seeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b915c55642375508183e4fc25d9e66d77b7eb03","amp;dn":"Sherman%5C%27s+March+%5B1986%5D+-+Ross+McElwee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b915c55642375508183e4fc25d9e66d77b7eb03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,145,92,85,100,35,117,80,129,131,228,252,37,217,230,109,119,183,235,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
