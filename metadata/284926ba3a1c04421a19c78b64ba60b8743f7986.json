John and I, proud grandparents, are happy to announce that our first grandchild has learned to read the books in Bob Book First!. \nShe was about 4 1/2 when the reading &quot;light bulb&quot; turned on. She loves to be read to, as always, but now she is proud that she can read to her little sister and to us. She will start kindergareten this fall. \n\nWe attribute Peggy's success to her mom who started early with magnetic letters on the refrigerator. She read everything from books to street signs to cereal boxes to her. \n\nThe Parent Teacher Guide enclosed in each set of Bob Books provides lots of information on what to expect and tips on getting ready to read. It is helpful before and during your child's reading experience. \n\nAfter Bob Books First!, Bob Books Fun! keeps your reader confident by providing an easy transition to Bob Books Kids!
