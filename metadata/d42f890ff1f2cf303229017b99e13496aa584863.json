Like Activision's Vampire: The Masquerade Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Redemption, Bloodlines is set in White Wolf, Inc.'s Vampire: The Masquerade universe also known as the World of Darkness (WoD), but it is not a sequel to the earlier game. The game allows the player to choose one of several different vampire clans and progress through the game according to the different strengths and weaknesses of the player's character, as in its paper and pencil role-playing origins.\nAlthough Bloodlines divided critics at the time of release, it retains a popular cult following.[1] It is also notable for being the first third-party game to use Valve's Source engine. The game can be played from either the first-person or third-person perspective. It is also Troika Games' third title and the last to be made before Troika closed down in February 2005.\n\nUnofficial patch v. 8.4.2 is included (it contains official patch v.1.2)\nTested on ML 10.8.2 iMac 2010 27 inch","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d42f890ff1f2cf303229017b99e13496aa584863","amp;dn":"Vampire%3A+The+Masquerade+-+Bloodlines+-+8.4.2+%5BMac%5D+%5BIntel-Cider%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d42f890ff1f2cf303229017b99e13496aa584863","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,47,137,15,241,242,207,48,50,41,1,123,153,225,52,150,170,88,72,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
