These Italian classics that Americans know and love are just the beginning; there are a wealth of other equally delicious breads and sweets waiting to be discovered.\n \nIn this groundbreaking classicÃ¢â‚¬â€now thoroughly updated for todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s modern kitchenÃ¢â‚¬â€Carol Field introduces artisanal doughs and techniques used by generations of Italian bakers. Every city and hill town has its own unique baking traditions, and Field spent more than two years traversing Italy to capture the regional and local specialties, adapting them through rigorous testing in her own kitchen. \n \nFieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s authentic recipes are a revelation for anyone seeking the true Italian experience. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a chance to make golden Altamura bread from Puglia, chewy porous loaves from Como, rosemary bread sprinkled with coarse sea salt, dark ryes from the north, simple breads studded with toasted walnuts, succulent fig bread, and Sicilian loaves topped with sesame seeds.\n\nThe Italian Baker is the only comprehensive book, in English or Italian, to cover the entire range of Italian baking, from breadsticks and cornetti to focaccia, tarts, cakes, and pastries. There is even a chapter on using leftover breadÃ¢â‚¬â€with recipes ranging from hearty Tuscan bread soup to a cinnamon and lemon-scented bread pudding.\n \nWinner of the International Association of Culinary Professionals Award for best baking book, The Italian Baker was also named to the James Beard BakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dozen list of thirteen indispensable baking books of all time. It has inspired countless professionals and home cooks alike. This latest edition, updated for a new generation of home bakers, has added four-color photography throughout, plus new recipes, ingredients and equipment sections, source guides, and weights. One of the most revered baking books of all time, The Italian Baker is a landmark work that continues to be a must for every serious baker.\n\n\nBy Carol Field\nPublished by Ten Speed Press in 2011\nEPUB, Retail, 432 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bfae7f701f7b56940db6040f6df0a40f6fd9e21","amp;dn":"The+Italian+Baker%2CRevised%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bfae7f701f7b56940db6040f6df0a40f6fd9e21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,250,231,247,1,247,181,105,64,219,96,64,246,223,10,64,246,253,158,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
