Originally telecast on September 19, 1975, the first of the season's six episodes is &quot;A Touch of Class,&quot; in which Basil is (mis)led to believe that his latest customer, one Lord Melbury, will at last bring some prestige to his seedy establishment. Next up is &quot;Builders,&quot; wherein waitress Polly (Connie Booth) is left in charge of the hotel while &quot;repairs&quot; are made in the lobby. This is followed by &quot;The Wedding Party,&quot; in which snoopy Basil goes to ridiculous extremes to catch his guests committing extramarital shenanigans. Also: in &quot;Hotel Inspectors,&quot; Basil agonizes over the possibility that he has insulted an important government functionary; our hero holds a &quot;Gourmet Night&quot; at the hotel, with disastrous results; and in the classic season finale &quot;The Germans,&quot; a chaotic fire drill threatens to spark a nasty international incident. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nTheatrical Feature Running Time: 170 mins \nComplete Cast:\nJohn Cleese - Basil Fawlty\nAndrew Sachs - Manuel\nBallard Berkeley - Major Gowen\nRenee Roberts - Miss Gatsby\nPrunella Scales - Sybil Fawlty\nConnie Booth - Polly Sherman\nGilly Flower - Miss Tibbs\nBrian Hall - Terry\n\n\nProducer(s):Douglas Argent, John Howard Davies\nCategories:Television\n\nDisc 2:\nOriginally broadcast from February 19 to October 25, 1979, the second and final season of BBC2's Fawlty Towers finds Torquay hotelier Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) continuing to insult and terrorize guests and staffers alike, while Basil's wife Sybil (Prunella Scales) proves anew that she is the most spectacularly unhelpful &quot;helpmate&quot; in the history of domestic relations. The first of the season's six episodes, &quot;Communication Problems,&quot; finds Basil the prime suspect when a wealthy and deaf-as-a-post guest insists that she's been robbed. In &quot;The Psychiatrist,&quot; Basil's inherent paranoia and Sybil's suspicions that her husband is cheating on her reach hitherto unimagined heights. An American guest's demands for after-hour room service drives Basil batty and the other guests to mount a &quot;revolt&quot; in &quot;Waldorf Salad.&quot; &quot;The Kipper and the Corpse&quot; is set in motion by the death of a guest after being served breakfast in bed, obliging Basil to hide both the body and the breakfast! &quot;The Anniversary&quot; is a slapstick comedy of errors involving a surprise party and a missing guest of honor. And in the concluding episode, &quot;Basil the Rat,&quot; the hotel's Spanish waiter, Manuel (Andrew Sachs), courts disaster when he adopts a &quot;Siberian hamster.&quot; ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nTheatrical Feature Running Time: 170 mins \nComplete Cast:\nJohn Cleese - Basil Fawlty\nAndrew Sachs - Manuel\nBallard Berkeley - Major Gowen\nRenee Roberts - Miss Gatsby\nPrunella Scales - Sybil Fawlty\nConnie Booth - Polly Sherman\nGilly Flower - Miss Tibbs\nBrian Hall - Terry\n\n\nProducer(s):John Howard Davies, Douglas Argent\nCategories:Television\n\nDisc 3:\nTheatrical Feature Running Time: 170 mins \n\nFormat: DVD\nRelease Date: 10/16/2001\nRunning Time: 510 min\nNumber of Discs: 3\nLanguage: Eng\nSubTitles: Eng/Fre/Ger\n\nBlockbuster Info Link:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.blockbuster.com/catalog/movieDetails/267895&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.blockbuster.com/catalog/movieDetails/267895&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8360616f456a110d89aff70c58c3f02a5bc0e321","amp;dn":"Fawlty+Towers+-+The+Complete+Series+-+3+Discs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8360616f456a110d89aff70c58c3f02a5bc0e321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,96,97,111,69,106,17,13,137,175,247,12,88,195,240,42,91,192,227,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
