But all through this recording the intensity has been turned up a notch since Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Love SupremeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the immediately preceding quartet recording. \nColtrane, despite an acute musical sensitivity, is clearly dancing outside the modes here. It's yet another reminder that Coltrane's greatness wasn't simply predicated on intellectual abstraction and rhythmic intensity, but on the most fundamental of human emotions. \n\n\nJohn Coltrane Quartet\n\nThe John Coltrane Quartet Plays . . .\n\n1965\n\n\n  CD / 1997 / Remastered / Bonus Tracks / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
