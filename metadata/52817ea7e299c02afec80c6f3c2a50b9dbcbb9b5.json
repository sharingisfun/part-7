His travels take him across both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, from upstate New York to San Diego to Alaska, from Japan to Holland and Mexico. In the end, he presents the testimony of patients, scientists, surgeons and nutritionists, who testify to the effectiveness of the Gerson Therapy and shows the hard scientific evidence to back up their claims.\n\nThe question that remains is, Why is this powerful curative therapy still suppressed, more than 75 years after it was clearly proven to cure degenerative disease?\n\nA spectacular combination of poetry, science and cinematographic art... very moving. - Pedro Aponte-Vazquez, Author, Chronicle of a Coverup\n\n\nIf this documentary is not immediately suppressed, millions of chronically-ill people will get well. - Andrew Saul, Asst. Editor, Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine\n\n\nIt&amp;#039;s just exquisite! Deft to the point of sublime. A major step forward.\n- John Robbins, Author, Diet for a New America, Reclaiming Our Health\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dyingtohaveknown.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dyingtohaveknown.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52817ea7e299c02afec80c6f3c2a50b9dbcbb9b5","amp;dn":"Dying+to+Have+Known","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52817ea7e299c02afec80c6f3c2a50b9dbcbb9b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,129,126,167,226,153,192,42,254,200,12,111,60,42,80,185,219,203,185,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
