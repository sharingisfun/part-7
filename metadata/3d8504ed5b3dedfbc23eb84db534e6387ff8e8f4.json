Sting incorporated heavy elements of jazz, classical, and worldbeat into his music, writing lyrics that were literate and self-consciously meaningful, and he was never afraid to emphasize this fact in the press. For such unabashed ambition, he was equally loved and reviled, with supporters believing that he was at the forefront of literate, intelligent rock and his critics finding his entire body of work pompous. Either way, Sting remained one of pop's biggest superstars for the first ten years of his solo career, before his record sales began to slip.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.When We Dance\n02.If You Love Somebody Set Them Free\n03.Fields Of Gold\n04.All This Time\n05.Fortress Around Your Heart\n06.Be Still My Beating Heart\n07.They Dance Alone (Cueca Solo)\n08.If I Ever Lose My Faith In You\n09.Fragile\n10.Why Would I Cry For You\n11.Englishman In New York\n12.We'll Be Together\n13.Russians\n14.This Cowboy Song\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d8504ed5b3dedfbc23eb84db534e6387ff8e8f4","amp;dn":"Sting+-+Fields+Of+Gold+Best+Of+%5C%2784-%5C%2794++%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d8504ed5b3dedfbc23eb84db534e6387ff8e8f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,133,4,237,91,61,237,251,194,62,184,77,181,52,230,56,127,248,232,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
