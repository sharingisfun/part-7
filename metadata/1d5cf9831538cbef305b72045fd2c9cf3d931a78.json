What begins as a philosophical argument rooted in linguistics (Chomsky) and the theory of knowledge (Foucault), soon evolves into a broader discussion encompassing a wide range of topics, from science, history, and behaviorism to creativity, freedom, and the struggle for justice in the realm of politics.\n\nIn addition to the debate itself, this volume features a newly written introduction by noted Foucault scholar John Rajchman and includes additional text by Noam Chomsky.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d5cf9831538cbef305b72045fd2c9cf3d931a78","amp;dn":"The+Chomsky-Foucault+Debate+-+On+Human+Nature+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d5cf9831538cbef305b72045fd2c9cf3d931a78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,92,249,131,21,56,203,239,48,91,114,4,95,210,201,207,61,147,26,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
