This covers the remainder of Chris Claremont's run on the title and goes through Scoot Lobdell's time as writer, ending at the 20th anniversary issue celebrating the 1975 relaunch of the title. In-between are brilliant tales of Wolverine's past, Magneto's trial and re-invention, many crossovers including X-Tinction Agenda, Fatal Attractions, Fall of the Mutants, Mutant Massacre, Blood Ties, X-Cutioner's Song, and more. The original X-Men, off on their own and reborn as X-Factor Investigations, are soon re-invited back into the fold and the large x-Men family splits into two teams during this run - Blue, lead by Cyclops, and Gold, led by Storm. There are many great tales to be had in this pack, and I hope you will enjoy reading some of the truly classic stuff that is presented within.\n\nI have previously uploaded digital copies of issues 01-66 here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9519291&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9519291&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSimilarly, the next pact collecting issues 94-153 is here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9759287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9759287&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSome of this material crosses over with other x-Men titles; digital copies of a few of those complete crossover events are here (with some duplication):\n\nX-Tinction Agenda (1990-1991) -   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9509979&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9509979&lt;/a&gt;\nX-Cutioner's Song (1992-1993) -   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9510188&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9510188&lt;/a&gt;\nFatal Attractions (1993) -        &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9510096&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9510096&lt;/a&gt;\nBloodties TPB (1993) -            &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9510256&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9510256&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEvery issue is from Empire scanners; the majority are from AnPymGold while some of the ones already released prior to these editions are by Meganubis. MAJOR thanks and credit to those scan groups for their efforts; PLEASE SEED this one and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:343840a28387ff1289dd929ff8fa835769a8670e","amp;dn":"Uncanny+X-Men+v1+154-325+%281982-1995%7CDigital%7CAPG%2BMeganubis-Emp%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"343840a28387ff1289dd929ff8fa835769a8670e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,56,64,162,131,135,255,18,137,221,146,159,248,250,131,87,105,168,103,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
