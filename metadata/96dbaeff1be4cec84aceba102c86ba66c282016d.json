Spanning the globe, and using the latest CGI reconstructions, Dan Snow gets to the very heart of the bloodshed and battles of the greatest fortresses of the Middle Ages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96dbaeff1be4cec84aceba102c86ba66c282016d","amp;dn":"Battle+Castles+-+500+Years+of+Knights+and+Siege+Warfare+-+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96dbaeff1be4cec84aceba102c86ba66c282016d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,219,174,255,27,228,206,200,74,206,186,16,44,134,186,102,194,130,1,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
