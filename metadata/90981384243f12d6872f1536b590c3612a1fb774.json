Featuring a selection of standards strongly associated with Baker, Elias mixes her native Brazilian bossa nova with swing, straight-ahead jazz, and even a few bluesy flourishes with much aplomb. The album, produced by Elias' husband, bassist Marc Johnson, also features guitarists Steve Cardenas and Oscar Castro-Neves, drummers Victor Lewis and Rafael Barata, and percussionist Marivaldo Dos Santos. Also adding more than a few moments of deft and thoughtful improvisation is trumpeter Randy Brecker.\n\nAs Baker grew up listening to the music of the '30s and '40s, many of his own choices for songs to play were informed by the great songbook of those decades. Baker also had a natural inclination toward a pretty melody and romantic lyric and he never failed to pick great songs to perform. Subsequently, Baker's recordings showcase a superb batch of tunes to choose from. Elias, who has also leaned toward playing melodic, often romantic music, is a perfect conduit for reinterpreting Baker. Here she plays such songs as &quot;There Will Never Be Another You,&quot; &quot;Let's Get Lost,&quot; &quot;Just Friends,&quot; &quot;Embraceable You,&quot; and &quot;I Get Along Without You Very Well.&quot; (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - I Thought About You\n02 - There Will Never Be Another You\n03 - This CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Be Love\n04 - Embraceable You\n05 - That Old Feeling\n06 - Everything Depends On You\n07 - IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Never Been In Love Before\n08 - LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Get Lost\n09 - You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t What Love Is\n10 - Blue Room\n11 - Just Friends\n12 - Girl Talk\n13 - Just In Time\n14 - I Get Along Without You Very Well\n\nEnjoy and share!
