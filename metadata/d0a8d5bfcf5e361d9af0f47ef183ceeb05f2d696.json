These inefficient and ineffective traditionalist approaches simply won&amp;#039;t prepare you for superior performance and they might even injure you!\n\nIn addition to serving as a great warm-up, the drills contained in this DVD will improve joint mobility ? an important, yet often-overlooked quality necessary for optimal health and performance.\n\nIn this information-packed DVD, Eric Cressey and Mike Robertson give you all the tools necessary to teach your body to move more safely, efficiently, and powerfully. With over 30 exercises and the rationale for their use included, Magnificent Mobility is guaranteed to provide drills to get you healthy and take your performance to the next level!
