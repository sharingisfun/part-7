Her distaste for artificiality leads her to a wild breakdown, and Richard dutifully tries to restore their family unit as best he knows how by hiring a 'Mother's Helper', Elizabeth (Sedgwick). Chase is broken, and wickedly caustic towards Elizabeth, until they discover each other's similarities. A strong relationship develops, affecting their personal and familial salvation, and destruction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75a2e4923045a3c43b13374f40249f75ef5be9fa","amp;dn":"Losing+Chase+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75a2e4923045a3c43b13374f40249f75ef5be9fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,162,228,146,48,69,163,196,59,19,55,79,64,36,159,117,239,91,233,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
