Please seed for the community.\n\n\n\n---\nPublished on Jun 1, 2013\nThis is what you get when you come to my place to watch a movie! Sorry about some of the stutters, Fraps is a bitch and those do not normally happen. Features:\n\nBasically everything you see is random. The trivia is random, there's about 700 slides. The music in the background during the trivia is random, there's around 50 songs which will play randomly. The sequence intros (such as &quot;Pre-show entertainment&quot;, &quot;Coming Soon&quot;, and &quot;Brett's Home Theater&quot;) are custom and easy to create. The movie trailers are actual upcoming movies (taken from iTunes trailers). The movie rating scene is based on the actual rating of the movie. The Dolby Digital scene is randomized from one of a bunch of promos for Dolby and is present because this is a Dolby audio film - there are also DTS and THX intros. \n\nThis is all of course skippable - Cinema Experience is optional. In XBMC, you can either simply &quot;Play&quot; a movie, or &quot;Cinema&quot; a movie to get this experience. It might seem like a long movie intro, but the &quot;Trivia&quot; section is meant to be played while I get popcorn and beer for guests, the trailers are meant to simulate a real movie theater experience, and the rest is pretty short. Again, it's all optional and each part is skippable.\n\nIf you want information about any of the stuff used here, let me know and I'll put together a longer description - I used off-the-shelf tools to do this, so anybody should be able to do the same or similar.\n\nI've put everything I used here into a neat little (well, large really - 3GB) package for you to download:\n\nPublished on Jun 1, 2013\nThis is what you get when you come to my place to watch a movie!
