Released by 20th Century Fox, the film starred Adam West as Batman and Burt Ward as Robin. The film was directed by Leslie H. Martinson, who also directed a pair of Batman episodes; &quot;The Penguin Goes Straight&quot; and &quot;Not Yet, He Ain't&quot;, both from season one.\n\nThe cast includes members of the original TV cast, including Alan Napier, Neil Hamilton, Stafford Repp and Madge Blake. Appearing as the criminal characters that they played on TV (and given the name the Rogues Gallery of Villains) are Frank Gorshin as the Riddler, Burgess Meredith as the Penguin, and Cesar Romero as the Joker. Julie Newmar, who left the movie before production started to do other work, is replaced with Lee Meriwether as Catwoman.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:213b7783596b62e481d474165cbebe1a23374a95","amp;dn":"Batman+-+The+Movie+of+the+TV+Series+%28Adam+West+-+Burt+Ward%29+%28196","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"213b7783596b62e481d474165cbebe1a23374a95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,59,119,131,89,107,98,228,129,212,116,22,92,190,190,26,35,55,74,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
