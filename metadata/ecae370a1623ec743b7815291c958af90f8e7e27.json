How did he finally break through? Ignoring just \nabout every rule of commercial book publishing, Pressfield's &quot;first&quot; \nnovel not only became a major bestseller (over 250,000 copies sold), it \nwas adapted into a feature film directed by Robert Redford and starring \nMatt Damon, Will Smith, and Charlize Theron. Where did he get the idea? What magical something did THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE have that his previous manuscripts lacked? Why did Pressfield decide to write a novel when he already had a well established screenwriting career? How does writing a publishable novel really work? Taking\na page from John Steinbeck's classic JOURNAL OF A NOVEL, Steven \nPressfield offers answers for these and scores of other practical \nwriting questions in THE AUTHENTIC SWING.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecae370a1623ec743b7815291c958af90f8e7e27","amp;dn":"The+Authentic+Swing+-+Steven+Pressfield","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecae370a1623ec743b7815291c958af90f8e7e27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,174,55,10,22,35,236,116,59,120,21,41,28,149,138,249,15,142,126,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
