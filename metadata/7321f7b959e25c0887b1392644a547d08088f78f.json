What makes so-called brainwashing so different from the equally insidious effects of indoctrination and conditioning, or even advertising and education?\n\nResearch findings from psychology show that brainwashing is not a special subversive technique; it is the clever manipulation of unrealized influences that operate in all our lives.\n\nThis book, by breaking down so-called brainwashing to its individual elements, shows how social conditioning, need for approval, emotional dependency and much else that we are unaware of, prevent us from being as self-directed as we think; and, conversely, which human traits make us the least susceptible to subtle influence.\n\n 217 pages Book length\n\t\nPublication date 2000 Jan 18\n\nPublisher \tMalor Books (January 18, 2000)\nLanguage \tEnglish\nISBN-10 \t1883536227\nISBN-13 \t978-1883536220\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Manipulated-Mind-Brainwashing-Conditioning-Indoctrination/dp/1883536227/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372460626&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Manipulated+Mind%3A+Brainwashing%2C+Conditioning+and+Indoctrination&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Manipulated-Mind-Brainwashing-Conditioning-Indoctrination/dp/1883536227/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372460626&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Manipulated+Mind%3A+Brainwashing%2C+Conditioning+and+Indoctrination&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hANAOaaeI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hANAOaaeI&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7321f7b959e25c0887b1392644a547d08088f78f","amp;dn":"The+Manipulated+Mind%3A+Brainwashing%2C+Conditioning%2C+and+Indoctrina","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7321f7b959e25c0887b1392644a547d08088f78f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,33,247,185,89,226,92,8,135,177,57,38,68,165,71,208,128,136,247,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
