The result is more or less the book equivalent of finding yourself sharing plates at a communal table with a chatty, witty, unapologetically profane, knowledgeable and well-connected member-observer of the restaurant big leagues. If, like him, you see the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest chefs as somewhere between rock and porn stars, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no way you wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spend hours listening to him chew your ear off with stories of that coke-fueled weekend (or was it a month?) trapped on an island with the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most insufferably wealthy food posers and with diatribes on how annoying Alice Waters is and how critic Alan Richman is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“douchebagÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (the nicer of the two things Bourdain calls him) for trashing the New Orleans food scene with the city still reeling from KatrinaÃ¢â‚¬â€and then turn on a dime to deliver an impassioned ode to Vietnamese pho and an admiring portrait of perhaps the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest fish-portioner at Le Bernardin. It might have been a narcissistic, condescending, and overly insiderish collection if it werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t for BourdainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s consistently disarming self-awareness that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“the very picture of the jaded, overprivileged Ã¢â‚¬ËœfoodieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (in the worst sense of that word) that he used to despise.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ On seeing himself through the eyes of a hungry young chef who still has to actually cook just to barely survive, he says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Look at me and my nice fucking jacket, standing there all famous and shit.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sure, others may cook better than he does, but no one can dish like he can.\n\nAuthor: Anthony Bourdain\nFormat: MP3\n\n=================================================================\n\n\n-nelly- home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.pe/user/-nelly-/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.pe/user/-nelly-/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.pe/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.pe/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!\n\n                 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor re-seed requests, help, support or anything else relating to The Pirate Bay.
