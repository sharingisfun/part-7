Meyers (Editor-in-Chief)\n\n\n\n\nThe highly acclaimed Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry provides a much needed \n\nprofessional level reference work for the 21st Century. Encyclopedia of Analytical \n\nChemistry is the most comprehensive analytical chemistry reference available, \n\ncovering all aspects from theory and instrumentation through applications and \n\ntechniques.\n\n\n\nThe chemistry and techniques are described as performed in the laboratory \n\n(environmental, clinical, QC, research, university), in the field or by remote \n\nsensing. The level of detail is similar to that of a lab protocol and together with \n\nthe cited references, will support the analysis of complex inorganic, organic and \n\nbiological structures by academic and industrial researchers. Encyclopedia of \n\nAnalytical Chemistry also enables preparation of procedures, protocols and \n\n&quot;cookbooks&quot; by managers and staff of laboratories.\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents:\n\n\n\nAPPLICATIONS OF INSTRUMENTAL METHODS.\n\n\nBiomedical Spectroscopy.\n\nBiomolecules Analysis.\n\nCarbohydrate Analysis.\n\nChemical Weapons Chemicals Analysis.\n\nClinical Chemistry.\n\nCoatings.\n\nEnvironment: Trace Gas Monitoring.\n\nEnvironment: Water and Waste.\n\nField Portable and Transportable Air and Vapor Measurement.\n\nFood.\n\nForensic Science.\n\nIndustrial Hygiene.\n\nNucleic Acids Structure and Mapping.\n\nParticle Size Analysis.\n\nPeptides and Proteins.\n\nPesticides.\n\nPetroleum and Liquid Fossil Fuels Analysis.\n\nPharmaceuticals and Drugs.\n\nPolymers and Rubbers.\n\nProcess Instrumental Methods.\n\nPulp and Paper.\n\nRemote Sensing.\n\nSteel and Related Materials.\n\nSurfaces.\n\n\n\nTHEORY AND INSTRUMENTATION.\n\n\nAtomic Spectroscopy.\n\nChemometrics.\n\nElectroanalytical Methods.\n\nElectronic Absorption and Luminescence Spectroscopy.\n\nGas Chromatography.\n\nInfrared Spectroscopy.\n\nKinetic Determinations.\n\nLiquid Chromatography.\n\nMass Spectrometry.\n\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance and Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy.\n\nNuclear Methods.\n\nRadiochemical Methods.\n\nRaman Spectroscopy.\n\nThermal Analysis.\n\nX-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Auger Electron Spectroscopy.\n\nX-ray Spectrometry.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ARTICLES.\n\n\nAnalytical Problem Solving- Selection of Analytical Methods.\n\nArchaeological Chemical Analysis.\n\nGravimetry\n\nKarl Fischer Moisture Determination.\n\nLiterature Searching Methodology.\n\nMicrowave Techniques\n\nMultivariate and Hyperspectral Image Analysis.\n\nQuality Assurance in Analytical Chemistry.\n\nQuantitative Spectroscopic Calibration.\n\nSpot Test Analysis\n\nTitrimetry\n\nTraceability in Analytical Chemistry.\n\nUltrafast Laser Technology and Spectroscopy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36dd07db6f7026ad2b1dc10c92a8d3bea28ebcb4","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Analytical+Chemistry+%28R.A.Meyers%29+-+theFreak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36dd07db6f7026ad2b1dc10c92a8d3bea28ebcb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,221,7,219,111,112,38,173,43,29,193,12,146,168,211,190,162,142,188,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
