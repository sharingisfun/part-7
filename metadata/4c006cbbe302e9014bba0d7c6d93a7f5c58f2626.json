They're songs that years later can evoke the sights, sounds, and even smells of the time we first heard them. &quot;Kiss Me,&quot; the red-hot, irresistible single from this self-titled release, will probably be one of those songs for the many who've by now experienced its charms. The culprits? A trio of youthful central Texans, by way of Nashville, called Sixpence None the Richer. On the rest of this Grammy-nominated gem, Sixpence serve an airy blend of Abra Moore-meets-Sundays acoustic pop. It's beautifully rich and constantly augmented by Leigh Nash's earthy vocals, Matt Slocum's songwriting genius, and steady rhythms from Dale Baker. Like Jars of Clay, Sixpence have &quot;raised the bar&quot; for the rest of late-'90s contemporary Christian music.\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, April 2009\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c006cbbe302e9014bba0d7c6d93a7f5c58f2626","amp;dn":"Sixpence+None+The+Richer+-+1998+-+Sixpence+Non+The+Richer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c006cbbe302e9014bba0d7c6d93a7f5c58f2626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,0,108,187,227,2,233,1,75,186,13,124,109,147,167,245,197,143,38,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
