You are the virtual mayor and as such, you will need to\n find the right balance between economic development for your city, public\n transportation, housing, social services, leisure activities and even special\n events in town. Realism has been pushed a little bit deeper with larger\n cities, more realistic and more sophisticated than ever before!Widen your\n horizon!Cities XL 2011 pushes its limits further: hundreds of new buildings\n and structures appear for a total of more than 700 constructions, leading the\n way for new building and combinations options never seen before in a City\n Builder. Many new maps are also available, for a total of 45 buildable maps.\n City management will offer the full experience thanks to the addition of\n public transportation (subway, bus) which will decongest downtown traffic\n while lowering pollution levels and increasing the population's satisfaction.\n A more elaborated tax system will let all apprentice mayors adjust personal\n and local business taxes. A new commercial user interface will permit trade\n between cities in single player mode if a player decides to develop several\n cities.
