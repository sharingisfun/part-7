Venom has always been more of an anti-hero than a true villain, and Remender explores the duality of the symbiote's aggressiveness and need to bond versus Flash's attempts to hold on to his humanity and sometimes shattered psyche. The series also has some suitably dark and twisted artwork from Tony Moore and others. All issues are digital; the first 35 are by Minutemen-Phd and the remaining are by Nahga-Empire. Thanks to them for these awesome copies; please seed and enjoy! :-) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ecd1b38c7d0a31b44332aaa3f567503b097fdb3","amp;dn":"Venom+v2+01-42+%282011-2013%2C+Dgtl%2C+MM%2BEmp%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ecd1b38c7d0a31b44332aaa3f567503b097fdb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,205,27,56,199,208,163,27,68,51,42,170,63,86,117,3,176,151,253,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
