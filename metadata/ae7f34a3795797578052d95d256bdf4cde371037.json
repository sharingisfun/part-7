When the nude and bloodied corpse of an attractive woman is found in a bathroom at the White House, Harlan Regis (Wesley Snipes), a top detective with the Washington D.C. police force, is assigned to investigate. However, Regis soon learns that the Secret Service, headed by Nick Spikings (Daniel Benzali), is launching their own investigation, and they want Regis to stay out of their way. While Alvin Jordan (Alan Alda), National Security Advisor to President Jack Neil (Ronny Cox), intervenes in Regis' favor, it becomes obvious that no one wants him poking his nose into a case in which the suspects include both the President and his ill-tempered son Kyle (Tate Donovan). Eventually, Regis finds an ally in Nina Chance (Diane Lane), a member of the Secret Service's team, while the President tries to fend off the investigation in the midst of an international crisis. Comedian Dennis Miller also appears as Regis' partner Stengel.\n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 48 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 672\n\nFrame Height: 384\n\nFrame Rate: 30fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 113kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae7f34a3795797578052d95d256bdf4cde371037","amp;dn":"Murder+at+1600%281997%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae7f34a3795797578052d95d256bdf4cde371037","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,127,52,163,121,87,151,87,128,82,217,93,37,107,223,76,222,55,16,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
