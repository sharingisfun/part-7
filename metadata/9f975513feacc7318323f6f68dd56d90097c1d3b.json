In fact, Sanchez has played in their groups for years. \n\nThe album also features contributions by bassist Scott Colley, and saxmen Chris Potter and David Sanchez.\n\nMigration is jazz at a highly energetic level, but at the same time rich with expressive overtones. The drummer shows real \n\nquality as a leader, guiding his band members along personal, multicoloured, trajectory sounds and to extract the very best \n\nfrom them. The heart of the album is represented by four tracks performed in quartet (Did You Get It?, Challenge Within, \n\nGreddy Silent and Inner Urge), where the two sax players, both on tenors, dominate the scene. In Sand, Pat Metheny s guitar \n\nis added to the base nucleus, in an arioso and lyrical composition that he wrote expressly for this recording. Ballade is \n\nreserved for trio with Potter, who proves himself a first-rate soloist even on soprano. Also performed\nin trio is the opening track of the CD, One For Antonio, a homage to the drummer written by Chick Corea. The finale is \n\ninstead entrusted to Sanchez and Metheny performing the famous notes of Solar by Miles Davis: the best way to conclude an \n\nalbum that from the beginning to the end doesn t show any slack in taste nor decrease in tension.\n\n\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\n\nSubido por \n&quot;Alrededor de Medianoche&quot;\nCiclo de jazz y blues que se emite por http://frecuenciavyp.com.ar cada lunes a las 21hs (Argentina). \n\nUpload by\n&quot;Around Midnight&quot;\nCycle of jazz and blues that emits by http://frecuenciavyp.com.ar every Monday to 21hs (Argentina). \t\n\nLos esperamos tambien por nuestro blog:\nWe also waited for by ours blog to them: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://aldemedianoche.com.ar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://aldemedianoche.com.ar&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f975513feacc7318323f6f68dd56d90097c1d3b","amp;dn":"Antonio+Sanchez+-+Migration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f975513feacc7318323f6f68dd56d90097c1d3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,151,85,19,254,172,199,49,131,35,246,246,141,213,109,144,9,124,29,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
