Club Life was very important to me back in the early days, but ever since the switch to 3FM when Tiesto decided to go in the direction of House and mainstream pop, I feel it lost a lot of its feel. So this will be my last bundle for it, unless there is demand here on TPB asking me to continue putting these bundles together.\n\n\nI plan on seeding forever, unless I have a hardware crash or ISP issues, both of which are short-term situations.  I would appreciate other people helping to seed, and please be patient as my upload speed is not very fast.\n\n\nThe episodes were sourced from Raz0812, narrenpost, and kacper6711. Some episodes were from IndexTrance's or AciDToX8's split tracks, but I rejoined them back to a single file. Bundles tend to survive better than single torrents for each episode, so let's keep this one going forever!\n\nI'm using the standard public trackers, and as always: DHT and PEX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bbe9e03489985fdd21fc0a4040e02d3f6efe2ca","amp;dn":"Tiesto+Club+Life+376-400","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bbe9e03489985fdd21fc0a4040e02d3f6efe2ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,190,158,3,72,153,133,253,210,31,192,164,4,14,2,211,246,239,226,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
