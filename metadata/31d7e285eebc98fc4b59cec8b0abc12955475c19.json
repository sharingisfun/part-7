Thats around 40 some odd years.  It was quite a chore to get them all, but if someone would like to rename these articles with the article titles, I am sure people down the road would appreciate it.  \n\nPlease subscribe to the New Left Review if you like what you are reading here, it is a great journal and many people who have greatly influenced radical/progressive/liberal/marxist/feminist/poststructuralist thinking have contributed to it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newleftreview.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newleftreview.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt is pretty reasonable for a subscription, and you can read the hard copy.  They sometimes give away free books with a subscription, and you can get access to all of the articles onli-- nevermind.\n\nPut a comment on this page if anyone ends up renaming this batch, and I will delete the old torrent after I make sure a new one is up.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31d7e285eebc98fc4b59cec8b0abc12955475c19","amp;dn":"New+Left+Review+1960+-+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31d7e285eebc98fc4b59cec8b0abc12955475c19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,215,226,133,238,188,152,252,75,89,206,200,176,171,193,41,85,71,92,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
