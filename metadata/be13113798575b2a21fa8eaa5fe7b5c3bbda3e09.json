From a ball-breaking mantis shrimp, to the seemingly-named-by-Wes-Anderson GeographerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cone Snail, to a dog with a penchant for unmentionables, to the UTTERLY HORRIBLE thing baby koalas put into their mouths, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty of weird stuff in the natural world for us to sink our, er, teeth into.\n\nAll that, plus an old man and his seal (strange reboot of the classic Hemingway novel), terrifying dino-birds, and tasmanian devils - not quite as tornado-y as cartoons have led us to believe, much more into Ã¢â‚¬Å“killing things and living inside them.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot to love in this episode, almost too much really, so get to it and join Mike, Kevin, and Bill (and, seriously, some utterly disgusting koalas) for National Geographic's TOTAL RIFF OFF: Killer Shrimp Ã¢â‚¬ËœN Friends!\n\n\nEpisode 2: Demon Bat &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tVqS9TM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tVqS9TM.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nA giant demon bat is terrorizing a Mexican village! Well, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actual fairly normal sized, as far as bats go. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really no more a demon than any other bat, now that you mention it. And Ã¢â‚¬Å“terrorizingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is being a bit sensational. It bit a cow. Maybe.\n\nBut itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a giant demon bat, because the guy National Geographic sends in after it is woefully under qualified to handle such a thing. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re frankly uncomfortable letting him near the cow. Richard Terry is a certified Poor ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Colin Farrell, with luxurious hair and a talent for pretending completely normal everyday scenarios are fraught with peril. He thrusts his camera in the face of irritated Mexicans and demands information about the demon bat that these people have never heard of, since they presumably are spending all their time dealing with real threats, such as the Chupacabra.\n\nThis episode was so goofy we ended up riffing the entire thing. Enjoy Total Riff Off: Demon Bat.\n\n\nEpisode 3: Guy and a Goose &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VFcxsQ9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VFcxsQ9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nMeet Dominic. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in love with a goose. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that? YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be right back after you alert the authorities? We completely understand.\n\nSo like we were saying, this guy is in love with a goose named Maria. He slowly walks around a park and she follows him. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s riveting. The goose even flies next to him as he rides around on a Vespa. Eventually, Dominic has a severe Vespa accident, possibly because there was an enormous goose flapping around right next to his head while he was trying to drive. Oh, and at some point in time Maria appears in an OK Go music video.\n\nYou canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make this sort of stuff up, nor can you flesh it out to an entire hour long show, so we also riffed some alligator wrangling rednecks and a corpse sniffing dog named Bullwinkle. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a whole gaggle of laughs! Watch it with your loved ones, (who are hopefully not geese.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be13113798575b2a21fa8eaa5fe7b5c3bbda3e09","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+Total+Riff+Off+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be13113798575b2a21fa8eaa5fe7b5c3bbda3e09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,19,17,55,152,87,91,42,33,250,142,170,95,231,181,195,187,218,62,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
