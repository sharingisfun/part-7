Breaking new stylistic ground, Liebert combines the intimacy of acoustic guitar with electric musicianship mixed with light touches of computer-added harmonies. \r\nSpanish flamenco, the signature sound so strongly associated with Liebert and Luna Negra, is still easily heard on this new title, perhaps nowhere so apparent as on the Spanish language Marvin Gaye classic &quot;Mercy Mercy Me....&quot; (AMG)\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/PrGrDZR.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
