Ã¢â‚¬Å“The problem between two people is never a Ã¢â‚¬ËœrelationshipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that isn't working,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is always that one or both of them donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how to relate in a better way. The real problem is behavioral, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easier to change behavior than to change an abstraction called a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœrelationship.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ King teaches the best methods for creating healthier relationships of all kindsÃ¢â‚¬â€with family members, friends, lovers and spouses, and the rest of the world as well as with our own body, mind, and spirit.\n\nIn a warm, conversational style, he shows us how to shift our behavior using holistic techniques based on his shamanistic understanding of consciousness. He also gives thefor specific relationship problems caused by such feelings as fear, anger, and alienation. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Many people spend their entire lives seeking to know the rules of the universe,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“so IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve decided to save them a lot of time by giving them out now, for free. The better we understand these rules the easier it will be for us to grow, to heal, and to have a good time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c98eca645c6e1d4c993b3298a315d570a56481a","amp;dn":"Happy+Me%2C+Happy+You+%28Huna%29-+Serge+Kahili+King+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c98eca645c6e1d4c993b3298a315d570a56481a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,152,236,166,69,198,225,212,201,147,179,41,138,49,93,87,10,86,72,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
