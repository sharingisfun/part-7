The novels are set in and around Iran and the greater Caspian region, a volatile corner of the world that Mayland has studied extensively.\n\nThe Colonel's Mistake (#1): Mark Sava, former CIA station chief of Azerbaijan, lives a quiet life as a professor at Western University in the city of Baku. But his peace is shattered by both the assassination of a high-level American during an international oil conference and the arrest of CIA operations officer Daria Buckingham for the crime.\n\nSava knows the Iranian American Buckingham wellÃ¢â‚¬â€he personally trained herÃ¢â‚¬â€and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe she had anything to do with the murder, so he visits a CIA control center to discuss the situation with the new station chief. When no one answers the outside intercom, Sava overrides the security code and stumbles upon the grisliest scene of his career. Now, he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but wonder if he really knows Buckingham as well as he thoughtÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nDetermined to find out, Sava soon finds himself and a partner caught in the middle of the new Great GameÃ¢â‚¬â€a deadly intelligence war over oil that has Iran, China, and the United States clawing at each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s throats. Meanwhile, Colonel Henry Amato, assistant to the US national security advisor, is keeping a close watch on the situation from Washington. His stake in the Great Game is highÃ¢â‚¬â€and personal. \n\nFrom the shadows of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most volatile region to the highest levels of Washington politics, The ColonelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mistake takes readers on an unforgettable ride where the good, the bad, and the brutal play a deadly chess game of global espionage.\n\nThe Leveling (#2): These days, Mark Sava spends more time in tutoring sessions than in cloak-and-dagger rendezvous. The former CIA station chief of Azerbaijan has settled into the modest life of a professor in BakuÃ¢â‚¬Â¦until an assassin makes a brazen attempt on his life in the hallowed halls of the national library.\n\nThe Azeri government deems Sava, with his complex past, a security threat and orders him out of the country immediately. At the same time, the CIA orders Sava back to the US. But when he receives cryptic photos that lead him to believe his friend John Decker has been kidnappedÃ¢â‚¬â€Sava knows he has no option but to find Decker.\n\nHe teams up with exÃ¢â‚¬â€œCIA spy and former girlfriend Daria Buckingham, and the two soon find themselves being chased by Chinese intelligence agents through the underworlds of Turkmenistan and Iran, caught in the middle of a secret conflict over oil that has the US and Iran tumbling headlong into war.\n\nFilled with the espionage intrigue and pulse-pounding action that made The ColonelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mistake a runaway hit, The Leveling brings to life in electrifying detail one of the most dangerous regions of the globe.\n\nSpy For Hire (#3): A kidnapped orphan triggers an intelligence war in the Middle East, catapulting top-spy Mark Sava into a desperate race against friend and foe alike.\n\nAzerbaijan didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want him. And now Kyrgyzstan may not be able to handle Mark Sava either. The exÃ¢â‚¬â€œCIA station chief has settled into a new, easy life as a spy for hire. But then his girlfriend, Daria, discovers the private intelligence agency employing Sava is connected to a strange plot involving a mysterious orphan.\n\nAs Saudi intelligence agents and the CIA seek out the boy for their own ends, Sava and Daria call on old friend and exÃ¢â‚¬â€œNavy SEAL John Decker to protect the child while they dig for the truth. Soon Sava has a front-row seat to a black ops war between the CIA, US Naval Intelligence, and foreign forcesÃ¢â‚¬â€and the boy is somehow the key to victory. Sava just wants to find the child a good home, but can he do so before his own broken past proves his undoing?\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
