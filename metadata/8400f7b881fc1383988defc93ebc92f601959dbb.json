Included in this definitive work are terms used in architecture and in such related subjects as pottery, costume, furniture, armor, heraldry, weaving, ornament, jewelry, music, and ecclesiastical ritual. Needlework, ivories, goldsmithery, and pigments are also extensively treated, as are Greek, Roman, and Christian antiquities.
