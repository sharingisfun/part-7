So what happens when the controversial\nMaher stops by StarTalk Radio? A rational discussion about some\nof todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most important issues.\n\nAlong with co-host Astrobiologist Dr. David Grinspoon, Neil and\nBill talk about climate change, squeezing into BillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s electric\ncar (a Tesla roadster), the value of space exploration, and\nwhether it is possible to reconcile religion and science.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn a few things about Carl Sagan you didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t\nknow Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including speculation about why Harvard denied him\ntenure Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from David, who grew up calling Sagan Ã¢â‚¬Å“Uncle CarlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½,\nand Bill, who took SaganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s astronomy course at Cornell.\n\nPart 2\nPost Date: 7 October 2012\n\nAccording to co-host astrobiologist Dr. David Grinspoon, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Science\nthrives on controversy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and in Part 2 of host Neil deGrasse TysonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\ninterview with Bill Maher, controversy is definitely on the menu.\n\nFrom the value of dissent in scientific progress to the dangers of\ndishonest science fueled by hidden agendas, the trio address climate\nchange, the death penalty, abortion, assisted suicide, legalization\nof marijuana, prostitution and whether science can inform morality\nlaws.\n\nBelieve it or not, Bill Maher actually takes a time out from\nattacking the Tea Party-led Republican war on science to actually\nsay something nice about Republicans. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry, though Ã¢â‚¬â€œ youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll\nget plenty of opportunity to disagree with Bill, whichever side of\nthe fence youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88d93123812684691a8af2198f5649b3ead9332e","amp;dn":"StarTalk+Podcast+-+Real+Science+With+Bill+Maher+Sept-Oct+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88d93123812684691a8af2198f5649b3ead9332e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,217,49,35,129,38,132,105,26,138,242,25,143,86,73,179,234,217,51,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
