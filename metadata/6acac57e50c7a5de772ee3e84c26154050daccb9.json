Providing a gentle introduction to the principles of the subject, \nthis textbook is ideal for graduate students starting their research in this \nexciting area. After basic ideas have been outlined, the book offers a thorough \nanalysis of second harmonic generation and related second-order processes, \nbefore moving on to third-order effects, the nonlinear optics of short optical \npulses and coherent effects such as electromagnetically-induced transparency. \nA simplified treatment of high harmonic generation is presented at the end. \nMore advanced topics, such as the linear and nonlinear optics of crystals, \nthe tensor nature of the nonlinear coefficients and their quantum mechanical \nrepresentation, are confined to specialist chapters so that readers can focus \non basic principles before tackling these more difficult aspects of the \nsubject.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6acac57e50c7a5de772ee3e84c26154050daccb9","amp;dn":"Cambridge+University+Press+Introduction+to+Nonlinear+Optics+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6acac57e50c7a5de772ee3e84c26154050daccb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,202,197,126,80,199,165,222,119,46,227,232,76,38,21,64,80,218,204,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
