Baker&amp;#039;s contributions to the rockin&amp;#039; and rollin&amp;#039; wing of &amp;#039;50s R&amp;B were in a class with Atlantic labelmates Ruth Brown and the Clyde McPhatter-era Drifters, as the stellar 20-track compilation Soul on Fire: The Best of LaVern Baker proves. Baker had a muscular delivery and a commanding personality on record, so much so that her ravishing visual appeal wasn&amp;#039;t even necessary (though it certainly didn&amp;#039;t hurt). Here she bellows and growls her way through rock &amp; roll standards like &quot;Tweedlee Dee&quot; (her first big hit), the oft-covered &quot;Jim Dandy&quot; (her only R&amp;B chart-topper), and &quot;See See Rider,&quot; not to mention Leiber &amp; Stoller&amp;#039;s gospel pastiche &quot;Saved.&quot; But Baker was equally powerful on her slow numbers, turning in positively smoldering performances on the classics &quot;Soul on Fire,&quot; &quot;Play It Fair,&quot; &quot;I Cried a Tear&quot; (her biggest pop hit), and &quot;I Waited Too Long,&quot; among others. Baker isn&amp;#039;t as much of a household name as she probably ought to be, but Soul on Fire is required listening for anyone interested in the first waves of R&amp;B and rock &amp; roll.
