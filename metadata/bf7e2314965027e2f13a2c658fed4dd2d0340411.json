But as is often the case in that country, history unfolded \nharshly. For the majority of Russians, the transition to a market system was \npainful and chaotic - and anything but democratic. Amid the confusion, a few \nshrewd and ruthless businessmen exploited the loopholes in the Soviet economy \nto make fast money, staving off a return to communist rule.\n\nNicknamed the oligarchs, these men, all billionaires, manoeuvred their way into \nRussia&amp;#039;s political inner circle during glasnost, are credited with Boris \nYeltsin&amp;#039;s re-election in 1996, and suspected of anointing Vladimir Putin in \n1999. They&amp;#039;re powerful men with powerful enemies, and they continue to shape \nRussian society.\n\nDizzying in its detail, The Rise and Fall of the Russian Oligarchs puts modern-\nday Russia into perspective.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf7e2314965027e2f13a2c658fed4dd2d0340411","amp;dn":"The+Rise+And+Fall+Of+The+Russian+Oligarchs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf7e2314965027e2f13a2c658fed4dd2d0340411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,126,35,20,150,80,39,226,241,58,44,101,143,237,77,210,208,52,4,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
