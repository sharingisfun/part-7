Also big thanks to iPirate7 for the English Audio (ripped from watchcartoononline).\n\nThis is the unedited version{don't believe me? Check Episode 2 at 19:45....your welcome ; ) } Currently only the edited version with english audio was released by Funimation, and Funimation has no ETA on when the unedited release is coming.\n\nThe English Audio is from a webrip, but is decent quality. Also I left Japanese Audio Subs on by default because there are alot of signs in this anime, and I wasn't able to make a seperate track for Signs/Songs. English Audio is on by default and it is synced with the video perfectly! I also took the liberty of properly naming all the episodes.\n\nI will be seeding this on my slower connection for a few hours, then I will have my faster connection going strong later tonight. Please Seed at 1:1 and enjoy : )\n\nMy Future Releases on Nyaa:\n~Sword Art Online Part 4 1080p Dual Audio~whenever it is available\n~S.A.O Batch Torrent- with all episodes(making sure they all are titled, and have signs/songs sub files) all depends on how busy I am might not get to do this, but i'd like to.\n\nMy Future Releases on ADC:\n~One Piece : Movie 10 - Strong World DVD/Bluray Combo- Should be up 1st week in Nov.\n~One Piece Season 5 Voyage 4- Should be up near end of Nov.\n\nOther than those releases that is all I will be uploading for a while im sad to admit. I will be gone starting in December for 4-5months(Basic/Job Training for the U.S. Air Force) so during that time I will be very busy and not able to upload/download.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor those who can't wait for the official DVD/Blu rays, this is great.\n\nPlease seed and spread some love!\n\nregards,\n-jnx_r","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7d1db7179db841a28ed4cdd5370a8cbd7ca7089","amp;dn":"Sankarea+Undying+Love+Unrated+%5B1080p%5D+%5BDual+Audio%5D+%5BChrisazter%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7d1db7179db841a28ed4cdd5370a8cbd7ca7089","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,209,219,113,121,219,132,26,40,237,76,221,83,112,168,203,215,202,112,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
