The new high-performance LEDs require a new level of knowledge to manage their higher light output, power requirements, and thermal management. Written by authorities in the field, this practical guide helps readers navigate the day-to-day engineering and systems design necessary to build complete LED systems, offering thorough information on the fields of optical performance, power, materials, thermal design, and modeling and measurement.\n\nBeginning with background information on LEDs and lighting, the book then provides in-depth exploration of the optical and electrical characteristics of LEDs; thermal performance and how to manage thermals; and DC and AC drive circuitry. It also looks at system performance and gives detailed examples of lighting design using LEDs. Finally, it covers making measurements of LED and light bulb characteristics, and building simulation models of LEDs.\n\nThis book concentrates on how things are actually done in the lab and in commercial markets. Rather than relying on theory, specific examples are worked out in detail to allow readers to design systems that actually work. Drawings and schematics show how measurements are actually made and how circuits really perform. Everyone from engineers and managers who design LED systems to undergraduates in electronics, electronics lab, and power supply courses to hobbyists will gain the knowledge to implement practical designs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0daf13c7e1a39ee5c624e6a8cee933c7e6293c2a","amp;dn":"Practical+Lighting+Design+with+LEDs+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0daf13c7e1a39ee5c624e6a8cee933c7e6293c2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,175,19,199,225,163,158,229,198,36,230,168,206,233,51,199,230,41,60,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
