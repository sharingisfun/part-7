For nearly 2,000 years, the Christian faith has remained at or near the center of Western moral debate and conceptions of human identity, just action, and ultimate meaning. It has both shaped history and responded to history, showing an extraordinary adaptability within greatly differing cultures.

How did a persecuted sect in 1st-century Palestine rise to command such a massive influence on human culture, imagination, and spirit? How did Christianity weather the first critical stages of its historical development and attain its fundamental and enduring cultural role?\n\n\n01 - The Historical Study of Christianity\n02 - The First Cultural Context-Greece and Rome\n03 - The First Cultural Context-Judaism\n04 - The Jesus Movement and the Birth of Christianity\n05 - Paul and Christianity's First Expansion\n06 - The Diversity of Early Christianity\n07 - The Unpopular Cult-Persecution\n08 - Forms of Witness-Martyrdom and Apologetic\n09 - Extreme Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd Centuries\n10 - The Shaping of Orthodoxy\n11 - Institutional Development before Constantine\n12 - The Beginnings of Christian Philosophy\n13 - Imperial Politics and Religion\n14 - Constantine and the Established Church\n15 - The Extension of Christian Culture\n16 - Monasticism as Radical Christianity\n17 - The Emergence of Patriarchal Centers\n18 - Theological Crisis and Council-The Trinity\n19 - Theological Crisis and Council-Christology\n20 - The Distinctive Issues of the Latin West\n21 - Expansion beyond the Boundaries of Empire\n22 - The Court of Justinian and Byzantine Christianity\n23 - The Rise of Islam and the Threat of Iconoclasm\n24 - Eastern Orthodoxy-Holy Tradition\n25 - From Roman Empire to Holy Roman Empire\n26 - Benedictine Monasticism and Its Influence\n27 - Evangelization of Western Europe\n28 - The Great Divorce between East and West\n29 - Monastic Reform\n30 - Cathedrals and Chapters\n31 - The Crusades\n32 - Papal Revolution\n33 - Universities and Theology\n34 - The Great Plague\n35 - Corruption and the Beginnings of Reform\n36 - The Ever-Adapting Religion\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:593eab063445a4628faae05810fd644c9555d7f7","amp;dn":"TTC+Audio+-+The+History+of+Christianity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"593eab063445a4628faae05810fd644c9555d7f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,62,171,6,52,69,164,98,143,170,224,88,16,253,100,76,149,85,215,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
