Sorry, Marvel, somethinâ€™ happened to your copy guy. Anyway, this is my first prose novel, and they got this dude Stefan Petrucha to write it. Heâ€™s good people. Heâ€™s written novels (Ripper and Dead Mann Walking) and comics (Power Rangers and X-Files). But hereâ€™s the thing: This book is about dogs. Dogs that turn into big nasty monsters. And then I gotta kill â€™em. Thing is, I like killing peopleâ€”the ones that deserve it, anywayâ€”but I wonâ€™t kill dogs. No way. So thatâ€™s what we call a character dilemma. Now in GraphicAudio! I was unaware that that was a thing until now, but as long the check clears. Know what Iâ€™m saying, ladies?\r\n\r\n\r\n[256kbps]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87885bf8a3b9d7ea4bddcc113314ad90789176e0","amp;dn":"%5BMARVEL%5D+Deadpool%3A+Paws+by+Stefan+Petrucha+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87885bf8a3b9d7ea4bddcc113314ad90789176e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,136,91,248,163,185,215,234,75,221,204,17,51,20,173,144,120,145,118,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
