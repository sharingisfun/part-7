I've also added a lot of data that wasn't there before.\n\nThis torrent consists of every soundtrack heard in the revived series of Doctor Who up until Series 6 (inclusive). The metadata available includes:\n\n-Title\n-Artist\n-Album Artist\n-Composer\n-Disc\n-Number of Discs\n-Track Number\n-Total Number of Tracks\n\nIn the original torrent, much of the songs were misnamed, examples include:\n-Roso's Theme (typo of Rose's Theme)\n-Adult in the TARDIS (typo of Adrift in the TARDIS)\n-Westmintr Brige (typo of Westminster Bridge)\n\nThere were also countless grammar errors, especially with capitalisation mid-title. I've had to change things like &quot;The Wedding Of River Song&quot; to &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot; an overwhelming number of times.\n\nThe entire process took around three hours; I'm hoping this won't go to waste. Please share and seed!\n\nCredits of the original torrent go to user Burn10110.\n\nThank you!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c76bb77ce4da69597e6cba9ea4dc50ba0d1cf16b","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+Revived+Series+1-6+Soundtracks+%2B+Specials+%28Complete+w","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c76bb77ce4da69597e6cba9ea4dc50ba0d1cf16b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,107,183,124,228,218,105,89,126,108,186,158,164,220,80,186,13,28,241,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
