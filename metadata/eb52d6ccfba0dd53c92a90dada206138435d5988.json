It was perhaps the car that appealed to the boy racer and, forever after, meant that young blokes could show off by spinning their wheels on a mod-ed up second-hand run-around. The humble Ford Escort might have been created as a family car, but when it was taken rallying a legend was born. Its victory in the 1970 London to Mexico Rally launched the Escort Mexico and British roads were never the same again. Now it's down to Phil Glenister and Ant Anstead to find, rescue and restore a rare Ford Escort Mexico back to the level that would make any boy racer proud.\n\n2)  Land Rover Series 1 \nThe Land Rover Series 1 is a seriously iconic British car. Born in 1948 it went on to conquer the world. Rugged, simple, but with only just 39,000 ever made, examples of this national treasure of automotive pride are getting harder and harder to find. Philip and Ant hope to find, rescue and restore a Landie back to as good as new. Unfortunately the only example they can get their hands on has been sitting in a barn for over 41 years - un-driven and covered in cat poo. Philip meets the fanatical Landie lovers who eat, drink and sleep these cars - from trialers who gather in damp woods early on Sunday mornings to thrash their cars in the most basic form of motor sport, to a real life Lawrence of Arabia who depended on the Series 1 to keep him alive in the desert.\n\n3)  Triumph Stag \nThe Triumph Stag is a car that represents the best and worst of British motoring. Launched in 1970 with continental good looks and a punchy V8 engine, it was the perfect car for the G&amp;T set. With more than a hint of the middle-aged playboy about its design, the glamour faded rather quickly as the car became synonymous with overheating engines and unexpected breakdowns and ceased production after seven years. Philip Glenister and Ant Anstead hope to find, rescue and rehabilitate a Stag back to better than new. Ant finds one under a tarpaulin at the back of a scrapyard. Philip meets members of the Stag owners' club in an attempt to understand whether the Stag's reputation for unreliability is fair.\n\n4)  Mini Cooper Mk1 \nThe Mini Cooper Mk1 was the car that changed everything. From its revolutionary design and front wheel drive, to its conquering record as a track and rally car, it was the small car with the big heart driven by royalty, 60s superstars and the man and woman on the street. Everyone loved the Mini and it is widely considered to be one of the greatest cars ever built. Now it's down to Philip Glenister and internationally renowned car designer Ant Anstead to find, rescue and restore one back to its former glory. But no ordinary model - Phil has set his hopes on an incredibly rare Mk 1 Cooper. Ant finally tracks one down in Dublin; a rusting heap at the back of a barn. Philip explores the story of the Mini and meets Stirling Moss. He throws one around one of the most dangerous roads in the county and the show concludes with a Mini flash mob.\n\n5)  MG-TC \nThe 1945 MG-TC was the little car that broke America, paving the way for the mass export of British sporty two-seaters for the next 30 years. It was the forerunner of the modern sports car, and the MGs that are universally admired today. Philip Glenister and car designer Ant Anstead are determined to find, rescue and restore a MG-TC back to its former glory. Philip must confront his own fears of driving a car that feels more like a museum piece than a sporty little runaround.\n\n6)  DeLorean DMC-12 \nPhilip Glenister and Ant Anstead try to restore a DeLorean DMC-12, an epic car that stands as a tribute to the excess of the 1980s. Philip goes to the US to research the fascinating and infamous story of the car with the unique design that was a star of the Back to the Future movies. Very few DeLoreans were ever made, after the company collapsed following serious allegations of improper conduct. Philip meets former workers at the original production site and also superfans of the car. He also meets with John DeLorean's daughter.\n\n7)  The Auction \nPhilip and Ant put their pride and joy collection of classic cars up for sale at one of the country's leading car auctions. Philip and Ant know their cars are loved, but will that mean anything in the altogether more hardnosed commercial world of the classic car auction, were love takes a back seat to business? The episode ends as the auction room fills with some familiar faces as the Ford Escort, the Mini Cooper, Triumph Stag, Land Rover Series 1, MG and DeLorean all go under the hammer.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/6099/vnzgt.jpg&quot;
