For instance it's about twice as fast as UNetbootin, Universal USB Installer or Windows 7 USB download tool, on the creation of a Windows 7 USB installation drive from an ISO. It is also marginally faster on the creation of Linux bootable USB from ISOs.

Once downloaded, the application is ready to use.\n\nI will take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the translators who made it possible for Rufus, as well as this webpage, to be translated in various languages. If you find that you can use Rufus in your own language, you should really thank them!\nUsage\n\nDownload the executable and run it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no installation is necessary.\n\nThe executable is digitally signed and the signature should state:\n\n    &quot;Akeo Consulting&quot; (v1.3.0 or later)\n    &quot;Pete Batard - Open Source Developer&quot; (v1.2.0 or earlier)\n\nNotes on DOS support:\n\nIf you create a DOS bootable drive and use a non-US keyboard, Rufus will attempt to select a keyboard layout according to the locale of your system. In that case, FreeDOS, which is the default selection, is recommended over MS-DOS, as it supports more keyboard layouts.\nNotes on ISO Support:\n\nAll versions of Rufus since v1.1.0 allow the creation of a bootable USB from an ISO image (.iso).\n\nCreating an ISO image from a physical disc or from a set of files is very easy to do however, through the use of a CD burning application, such as the freely available CDBurnerXP or ImgBurn.\nNotes on UEFI &amp; GPT support:\n\nSince version 1.3.2, Rufus support UEFI as well as GPT for installation media, meaning that it will allow you to install Windows 7, Windows 8 or Linux in full EFI mode.\nHowever, Windows Vista or later is required for full UEFI/GPT support. Because of OS limitations, Windows XP restricts the creation of UEFI bootable drives to MBR mode.\n\nThis is a generous person whom asks that you support other programers that need the financial assistance\n\nScanned (With Kaspersky) And 100% Clean.\n\nPlease Leave A Comment Confirming This Pack\n\nPLEASE SEED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\n        This is a exe.
