He is responsible of firing almost half the employees in London and implement major cut-downs. In the turmoil that follows he decides to sack the manager RUBY, a 29-year-old seductress with whom he has been having an affair that affects his personal as well as his professional life. After a day of ultimate stress Joy finally decides to finish off all his paperwork and stand proud in front of his partners for a board meeting that will definitely change his life. Almost after 5 hours of the firing incident, the final two hours in the office is a stressful event. The real time depiction of the horrific time spent by JOY at the empty office filled with the curse of people who have been recently fired is the crux of the film FIRED. It's a supernatural influence that keeps JOY haunted in his own empty office, and also the twin demons of PROZAC and insecurity that turn a happy go lucky man into a stark-raving suicidal guy. In a matter of couple of hours the strong man Joy turns into a pleading mad guy seeing ghosts of his lover and her kid at every nook and corner. Everything around in the seemingly nondescript office become the targets of his paranoia, fed by the crazy hallucinatory effects of his anti depressant pills. FIRED is a real time depiction of the last two hours in the life of a CEO who has recently fired almost half his employees, set in an empty office space, which also acts as a major character, enhancing the suspense of the film Written by Anonymous\n\n::Trackers::\nCode: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.istole.it/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.istole.it/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80\nudp://tracker.ccc.de:80\nudp://tracker.publicbt.com:80\nudp://tracker.istole.it:80 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInfo Hash:078C8631083C15305A0CDA4760BEE33CB248FDCD \n\n::Screen Shots::\n[img]http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/7525/12546408.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/7516/56903735.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img805.imageshack.us/img805/7717/24878840.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/8236/90877225.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img407.imageshack.us/img407/6696/39645960.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img845.imageshack.us/img845/7743/47200314.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/3555/49611459.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/3373/38435130.png[/img]\n\nwe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n\n::Greetz::\nTo All Silver RG Encoders,AliBaloch,Emad,Torrentstate,Kingdom RG &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n::Note::\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silvertorrents.me,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\n::Support::\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:078c8631083c15305a0cda4760bee33cb248fdcd","amp;dn":"Fired+2010+Hindi+480p+BDRip+Ali+Baloch+Silver+RG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"078c8631083c15305a0cda4760bee33cb248fdcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,140,134,49,8,60,21,48,90,12,218,71,96,190,227,60,178,72,253,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
