In making the selection, I thought for some time before opting to include such works as the Sharpe books of Bernard Cornwell, Ellis Peters' Cadfael series and the Michael Jecks Coroner novels. However, I was assured by someone with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the Napoleonic Wars that the Sharpe stories contain surprisingly accurate historical detail. As such authors as Ellis Peters, Lindsey Davis and Michael Jecks seem to be equally careful with their research, I saw no reason to exclude them or to deny them the same exposure as that offered to other authors using a historical template, just because they chose a criminal core for their stories.\n\nI have, however, decided to avoid the avowed fantasy novels of David Gemmell and any suggestion of alternative realities.\n\nI shall not try here to list all the books included; but the authors are:\n\nAlex Haley\nAlison Weir\nBernard Cornwell\nBoris Pasternak\nC J Sansom\nChris Bradford\nChristian Cameron\nColleen McCullough\nConn Iggulden\nDorothy Dunnett\nEiji Yoshikawa\nElizabeth Chadwick\nEllis Peters\nErich Maria Remarque\nGary Jennings\nGeorgette Heyer\nJames Clavell\nJean M Auel\nJean Plaidy\nJeff Shaara\nKen Follett\nLarry McMurtry\nLaura Joh Rowland\nLeon Uris\nLindsey Davis\nMary Renault\nMary Stewart\nMaurice Druon\nMichael Jecks\nMichael Shaara\nPhilippa Gregory\nRobert Graves\nRobert Harris\nSharon K Penman\nSimon Scarrow\nSir Walter Scott\nSteven Pressfield\nSteven Saylor\nTim Severin\nTom Holt\nValerio Massimo Manfredi\nWilbur Smith\n\nAll are MOBIs; but the collection does not contain all the historical novels by the listed authors and there is therefore plenty of scope for interested readers to search out further gems.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e83ecd96f56febfe7c7bbd9c6959ea85bf28aa76","amp;dn":"The+Historical+Novels+Collection++%28mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e83ecd96f56febfe7c7bbd9c6959ea85bf28aa76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,62,205,150,245,111,235,254,124,123,189,156,105,89,234,133,191,40,170,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
