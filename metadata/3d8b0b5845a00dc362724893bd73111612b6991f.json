New material on slender columns, seismic design, anchorage using headed deformed bars, and reinforcing slabs for shear using headed studs has been added. The notation has been thouroughly updated to match changes in the ACI Code.\nThe text also presents the basic mechanics of structural concrete and methods for the design of individual members for bending, shear, torsion, and axial force, and provides detail in the various types of structural systems applications, including an extensive presentation of slabs, footings, foundations, and retaining walls.\n\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 816 pages\nPublisher: McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math; 13 edition (2003)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0070598541\nISBN-13: 978-0070598546","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d8b0b5845a00dc362724893bd73111612b6991f","amp;dn":"Design+of+Concrete+Structures+13th+Edition+by+Arthur+Nilson%2C+Dav","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d8b0b5845a00dc362724893bd73111612b6991f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,139,11,88,69,160,13,195,98,114,72,147,189,115,17,22,18,182,153,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
