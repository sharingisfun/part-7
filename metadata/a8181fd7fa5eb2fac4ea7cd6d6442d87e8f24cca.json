The save stores the unit positions which are demonstrated in the preview map when you load the battle. The date and time is always visible in the battle briefing to have exact knowledge of the campaign situation.\nNote: Unit actions such as charge or retreat are not saved.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Final battle Statistics: When you finish the campaign you get the final report for all the units that fought the battle via Order of Battle or Full Unit list.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Menu music: Added music to main menu. Other music tracks pending to be added.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Easier custom battle unlock: After completing a battle phase you unlock the rest custom battles of the same phase.

In particular the AI is now better in handling artillery, reinforcing areas and flanking. Additionally all personalities will be aggressive enough to push for an assault when it is needed to win the battle.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Gameplay balance fine tunes: Several important changes to all the battle mechanics, especially to morale, combat lethality and battle pace with aim to increase realism and challenge.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Artillery targeting major improvement: Issues that were reported should be now fixed.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Melee mechanics improvement: Melee will last longer and will be more bloody.\n\nTEXT/CAMPAIGN BATTLE FLOW\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The multi-day battle is now finalized including 4th day.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Numerous fixes in texts.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Battle Flow improvements.\n\nBUG FIXES\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed several bugs that could result in game freezes.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed freeze when pushing out of map units that were still in reinforcement movement mode.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed melee tremble (flag and soldiers to move very fast left-right).\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed units cancelling their reinforcement path to target enemies from far distance, issue especially annoying for AI artillery.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed morale not regenerating fast enough in some cases.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed issues that could result in wrong retreat paths.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed all remaining Decision room maps that were not visible.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Partial fix of units not firing enemies near them.\n---------------------\n\nThe tutorial videos we wrote about in the preview notes of the patch will be available in the next update.
