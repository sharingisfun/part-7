The restÃ¢â‚¬â€96 percent of the universeÃ¢â‚¬â€is completely unknown.\n\nRichard Panek tells the dramatic story of how scientists reached this conclusion, and what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing to find this &quot;dark&quot; matter and an even more bizarre substance called dark energy. Based on in-depth, on-site reporting and hundreds of interviewsÃ¢â‚¬â€with everyone from BerkeleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feisty Saul Perlmutter and Johns HopkinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meticulous Adam Riess to the quietly revolutionary Vera RubinÃ¢â‚¬â€the book offers an intimate portrait of the bitter rivalries and fruitful collaborations, the eureka moments and blind alleys, that have fueled their search, redefined science, and reinvented the universe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:676035dd1e13d7e7b7d2fb9aed2bfcb0da0455ef","amp;dn":"The+4+Percent+Universe+%5BRichard+Panek+2011%5D.epub+%7BCharm-Quark%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"676035dd1e13d7e7b7d2fb9aed2bfcb0da0455ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,96,53,221,30,19,215,231,183,210,251,154,237,43,252,176,218,4,85,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
