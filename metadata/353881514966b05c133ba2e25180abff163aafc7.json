It is the band's best-selling career disc, spending 330 weeks on the Billboard 200 album chart (more than any other compilation album, except for Bob Marley's 'Legend' disc, in history).\n\n\n Greatest Hits is an excellent, thorough 14-track collection containing all of Journey's big hits, from 1978's &quot;Wheel in the Sky&quot; to 1986's &quot;I'll Be Alright Without You.&quot; Although the songs aren't presented in chronological order and a handful of minor hits (&quot;Suzanne,&quot; &quot;Walks Like a Lady&quot;) aren't included, it doesn't matter, since every essential Journey single -- &quot;Only the Young,&quot; &quot;Don't Stop Believin',&quot; &quot;Any Way You Want It,&quot; &quot;Separate Ways,&quot; &quot;Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin',&quot; &quot;Open Arms,&quot; &quot;Send Her My Love&quot; -- is here, which means that it's all most casual fans will ever need.
