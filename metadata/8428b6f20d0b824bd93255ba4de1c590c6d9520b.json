Being transported to some weird dimension full of goblins, dwarves, swamplings, stupid wizards and sleeping giants is definitely one of them. \n\nWhen Simon discovers the tuneless bard, the repulsive Rapunzel and a pair of demons with a serious attitude problem, it could just prove to be one clichÃƒÂ© too far.\n\nWith a Nobel prize for attempted humour and puzzles so fiendish you'll certainly need help from the wise owl, Simon the Sorcerer is guaranteed to provide a distraction from the drudgery of modern life.\n\nYou can choose between subtitled and full talkie version of the game.\n\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8428b6f20d0b824bd93255ba4de1c590c6d9520b","amp;dn":"Simon+the+Sorcerer+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8428b6f20d0b824bd93255ba4de1c590c6d9520b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,40,182,242,13,11,130,75,217,50,85,186,77,225,197,144,198,217,82,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
