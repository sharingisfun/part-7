WITHOUT MERCY, WITHOUT SENSE, BUT NEVER WITHOUT HEART... SABRINA: He was supposed to be my big break Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not my total breakdown. Interviewing Anton Ivankov, the infamous kingpin, was my chance to outrun my broken past. I came ready, determined, but nothing truly could've prepared me for him. Anton wasn't supposed to be so damned handsome. He wasn't supposed to have a heart. And he definitely wasn't supposed to make me a pawn in his prison break. Now, he's making me question everything I've ever known, replacing common sense with raw desire. Can I escape before he's done playing wrecking ball Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or will this mad need to leap into his bed ruin me forever? ANTON: I never knew looks could blindside a man until I saw her. Sabrina was destined to be my ticket outta this hellhole and a secret weapon in our street war. Except I'm not working for family fortune anymore. Every time we touch, it's lightning, dangerous and divine. Hurricane Sabrina's blinding me to the mission. Her twisted uncle needs to pay big time, but she's got me so distracted I can barely think. I'll kill for this girl, anything to hear her beg for one dirty, reckless, unforgettable night. Good thing I never fail. I'll do whatever it takes to finish this war and end this Romeo and Juliet crap for good. The only happy ending here is making sure her panties, her heart, her everything are mine, and I'm gonna have it all. I always do","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9928bab3bfc43eeb797a28d351bfb6449e6fd9a","amp;dn":"Recklessly+His+by+Nicole+Snow+%28Bad+Boy+Mafia+%231%29+ePub+-+Xetron","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9928bab3bfc43eeb797a28d351bfb6449e6fd9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,146,139,171,59,252,67,238,183,151,162,141,53,27,251,100,73,230,253,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
