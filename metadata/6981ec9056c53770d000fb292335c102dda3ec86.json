Stenesh (Wiley, 1989).pdf\r\n\r\nIn response to the expansion of knowledge in biochemistry and molecular biology, the Second Edition of this reference has been completely revised and updated, with approximately 16,000 new entries. Names of specific compounds and other substances have been substantially enlarged, and definitions have been expanded for clarity and precision. Information is drawn from over 500 books and 1,000 articles, including recommendations of the Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, and the International Union of Biochemistry. Terms used by biochemists from a broad range of sciences, such as chemistry, immunology, genetics, virology, biophysics, and microbiology, are included. Abbreviations, both standard and nonstandard, are also provided, as well as cross-referenced synonymous expressions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6981ec9056c53770d000fb292335c102dda3ec86","amp;dn":"Dictionary+of+Biochemistry+and+Molecular+Biology+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6981ec9056c53770d000fb292335c102dda3ec86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,129,236,144,86,197,55,112,208,0,251,41,35,53,193,2,221,163,236,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
