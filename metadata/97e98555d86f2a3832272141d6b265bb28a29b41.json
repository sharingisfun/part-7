Told in a sentimental tone, Burns weaves a lyrical tale of the great metropolis that encompasses not only the city&amp;#039;s streets, but also that of the history of America. Though around fourteen hours in length, this epic documentary presents a thoughtful, entertaining look at our relatively young country.\n\nI have a very slow connection so please share and if you can upload it to file storing servers that&amp;#039;s even better. Just add links in comments.\n\n\n\n\nxxxyyyzzz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97e98555d86f2a3832272141d6b265bb28a29b41","amp;dn":"New+York%2C+A+Documentary+Film+-+04+-+The+Power+And+The+People","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97e98555d86f2a3832272141d6b265bb28a29b41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,233,133,85,216,111,42,56,50,39,33,65,214,178,101,187,40,162,155,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
