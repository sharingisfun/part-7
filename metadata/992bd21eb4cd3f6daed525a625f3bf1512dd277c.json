Macy\nKyra Sedgwick\nKathy Baker\n\nWritten by William H. Macy &amp; Steven Schachter\n\nRuntime: 90 min\nLanguage: English\n\nNominated for 2 Golden Globes. Another 12 wins &amp; 11 nominations\n\nBased on the true story of Bill Porter, A man with cerebral palsy is determined to become a salesman.\nMovies today are so full of meanness, of violence, of generally nasty people, that this small movie about a man who insisted on earning his own way in life just shines like a beacon. William H. Macy's performance is award caliber. Actually everyone in the film is believable, and most are likeable and all are interesting. Bill Porter is a hero for modern America; this movie is inspiring.\n\nVideo: Xvid 624x464 23.98fps\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 111kbps\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274468/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274468/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:992bd21eb4cd3f6daed525a625f3bf1512dd277c","amp;dn":"Door+To+Door+William+H+Macy+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"992bd21eb4cd3f6daed525a625f3bf1512dd277c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,43,210,30,180,205,63,109,174,213,37,166,37,243,191,21,18,221,39,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
