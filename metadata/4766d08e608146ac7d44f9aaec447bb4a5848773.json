However, this serenity does not last for long and, when a silenced gunshot narrowly misses Webb's head; the Bourne Persona reawakens in him yet again. Bourne's first objective is to get to his long time friend and handler at the CIA, Alex Conklin. However, unbeknownst (as yet) to Bourne, a Hungarian by the name of Stephan Spalko has now drawn Jason into a webÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½one which he cannot escape as easily as his professorial faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade.\n\n\n== The Bourne Betrayal (2007) ==\nason Bourne takes a mission to rescue his only friend in the CIA, Martin Lindros, who disappeared in Africa while tracking shipments of yellowcake uranium. Once safely back in America, Lindros persuades Bourne to help track the money trail of terrorists buying the nuclear material in Odessa. But once there, Bourne is hampered by confusing flashbacks of unfamiliar places and events and he wonders: Is someone brainwashing him in order to throw him off the trail? Worse, is the man he saved in Africa really Martin Lindros? Now, Bourne must gather evidence while trying to stay one step ahead of the terrorists who won't let anyone stand in their way of destroying the U.S.\n\n\n== The Bourne Sanction (2008) ==\nJason Bourne returns to Georgetown University and the mild world of his alter ego, David Webb, hoping for normalcy. But after so many adrenaline-soaked years of risking his life, Bourne finds himself chafing under the quiet life of a linguistics professor. \n  Aware of his frustrations, his academic mentor, Professor Specter, asks for help investigating the murder of a former student by a previously unknown Muslim extremist sect. The young man died carrying information about the group's terrorist activities, including an immediate plan to attack the United States. \n  The organization, the Black Legion, and its lethal plot have also popped up on the radar of Central Intelligence, where new director Veronica Hart is struggling to assert her authority. Sensing an opportunity to take control of CI by showing Hart's incompetence, National Security Agency operatives plan to accomplish what CI never could-hunt down and kill Bourne. \n  In Europe, Bourne's investigation into the Black Legion turns into one of the deadliest and most tangled operations of his double life-the pursuit of the leader of a murderous terrorist group with roots in the darkest days of World War II-all while an assassin as brilliant and damaged as himself is getting closer by the minute . . \n\n\n== The Bourne Deception (2009) ==\nThe seventh novel in the Jason Bourne series created by Robert Ludlum. It is Lustbader's fourth Bourne novel, following The Bourne Sanction that was published in 2008.\nThe Bourne Deception picks up where The Bourne Sanction left off. Jason Bourne's nemesis, Arkadin, is still hot on his trail and the two continue their struggle, reversing roles of hunter and hunted. When Bourne is ambushed and badly wounded, he fakes his death and goes into hiding. In safety, he takes on a new identity, and begins a mission to find out who tried to assassinate him. Jason begins to question who he really is, how much of him is tied up in the Bourne identity, and what he would become if that was suddenly taken away from him. Meanwhile, an American passenger airliner is shot down over Egypt by what seems to be an Iranian missile. A massive global investigative team is assembled to get at the truth of the situation before it can escalate into an international scandal. Jason Bourne's search for the man who shot him intersects with the search for the people that brought down the airliner, leading Bourne into one of the most deadly and challenging situations he has ever encountered. With the threat of a new world war brewing, Bourne finds himself in a race against time to uncover the truth and find the person behind his assault, all the while being stalked by his unknown nemesis.\n\nFollowing this novel, Eric Van Lustbader has revealed at his official website, that the eighth Jason Bourne novel's working title is: The Bourne Objective (scheduled for June 2010).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4766d08e608146ac7d44f9aaec447bb4a5848773","amp;dn":"THE+BOURNE+SERIES+-+Eric+Van+Lustbader+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4766d08e608146ac7d44f9aaec447bb4a5848773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,102,208,142,96,129,70,172,125,68,249,170,236,68,123,180,165,132,135,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
