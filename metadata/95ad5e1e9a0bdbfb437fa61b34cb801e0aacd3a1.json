LevinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Liberty and Tyranny appeared in the early months of the Obama presidency, Americans responded by making his clarion call for a new era in conservatism a #1 New York Times bestseller for an astounding twelve weeks. As provocative, well-reasoned, robust, and informed as his on-air commentary, with his love of our country and the legacy of our Founding Fathers reflected on every page, LevinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s galvanizing narrative provides a philosophical, historical, and practical framework for revitalizing the conservative vision and ensuring the preservation of American society.\n\nIn the face of the modern liberal assault on Constitution-based values, an attack that has resulted in a federal government that is a massive, unaccountable conglomerate, the time for reinforcing the intellectual and practical case for conservatism is now. In a series of powerful essays, Levin lays out how conservatives can counter the tyrannical liberal corrosion that has filtered into every timely issue affecting our daily lives, from the economy to health care, global warming to immigration, and more.\n\nAmeritopia\n\nThe man of system . . . is apt to be very wise in his own conceit; and is often so enamoured with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it. He goes on to establish it completely and in all its parts, without any regard either to the great interests or to the strong prejudices which may oppose it. He seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chess-board. . . .  Ã¢â‚¬â€Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, 1759\n\nIN THIS INTELLECTUALLY BRACING #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER, leading conservative thinker Mark R. Levin draws astoundingly relevant parallels to the Obama eraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dangerous utopian ideals from PlatoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Republic, Thomas MoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Utopia, Thomas HobbesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Leviathan, Karl MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Communist Manifesto, and from the critical works of John Locke, Charles Montesquieu, Alexis de Tocqueville, and other philosophical pioneers who brilliantly diagnosed the nature of man and government.\n\nThe Liberty Amendments\n\nMARK R. LEVIN HAS MADE THE CASE, IN NUMEROUS NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING BOOKSÃ¢â‚¬â€MEN IN BLACK, LIBERTY AND TYRANNY, AND AMERITOPIAÃ¢â‚¬â€THAT THE PRINCIPLES UNDERGIRDING OUR SOCIETY AND GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM ARE UNRAVELING. IN THE LIBERTY AMENDMENTS, HE TURNS TO THE FOUNDING FATHERS AND THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF FOR GUIDANCE IN RESTORING THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC.\n\nFor a century, the Statists have steadfastly constructed a federal Leviathan, distorting and evading our constitutional system in pursuit of an all-powerful, ubiquitous central government. The result is an ongoing and growing assault on individual liberty, state sovereignty, and the social compact. Levin argues that if we cherish our American heritage, it is time to embrace a constitutional revival.\n\nThe delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and the delegates to each stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ratification convention foresaw a time whenÃ¢â‚¬â€despite their best efforts to forestall itÃ¢â‚¬â€the Federal government might breach the ConstitutionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s limits and begin oppressing the people. Agencies such as the IRS and EPA and programs such as Obamacare demonstrate that the FramersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fear was prescient. Therefore, the Framers provided two methods for amending the Constitution. The second was intended for our current circumstancesÃ¢â‚¬â€empowering the states to bypass Congress and call a convention for the purpose of amending the Constitution. Levin argues that we, the people, can avoid a perilous outcome by seeking recourse, using the method called for in the Constitution itself.\n\nThe Framers adopted ten constitutional amendments, called the Bill of Rights, that would preserve individual rights and state authority. Levin lays forth eleven specific prescriptions for restoring our founding principles, ones that are consistent with the FramersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ design. His proposalsÃ¢â‚¬â€such as term limits for members of Congress and Supreme Court justices and limits on federal taxing and spendingÃ¢â‚¬â€are pure common sense, ideas shared by many. They draw on the wisdom of the Founding FathersÃ¢â‚¬â€including James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and numerous lesser-known but crucially important menÃ¢â‚¬â€in their content and in the method for applying them to the current state of the nation.\n\nNow is the time for the American people to take the first step toward reclaiming what belongs to them. The task is daunting, but it is imperative if we are to be truly free.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95ad5e1e9a0bdbfb437fa61b34cb801e0aacd3a1","amp;dn":"Mark+R.+Levin-Liberty+Collection+%5BLiberty+%26amp%3B+Tyranny-Ameritop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95ad5e1e9a0bdbfb437fa61b34cb801e0aacd3a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,173,94,30,154,11,219,251,67,127,166,27,52,203,128,30,10,172,211,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
