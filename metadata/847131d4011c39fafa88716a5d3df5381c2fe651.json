In TeslaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own words, are such topics as wireless transmission of power, death rays and radio-controlled airships. In addition rare material on German bases in Antarctica and South America, and a secret city built at a remote jungle site in South America by one of TeslaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s students, Guglielmo Marconi. MarconiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s secret group claims to have built flying saucers in the 1940s and to have gone to Mars in the early 1950s! Incredible photos of these Tesla craft are included. The Ancient Atlantean system of broadcasting energy through a grid system of obelisks and pyramids is discussed and a fascinating concept comes out of one chapter that the Egyptian engineers had to wear a protective metal head-shields while in these power-plants, hence the Egyptian PharoahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s head covering as well as the Face on Mars! Contains: Tesla's plan to transmit free electricity into the atmosphere; How electrical devices would merely have small antennas on them; Why unlimited power could be utilized anywhere on earth; How his inventions could utilize this free energy in the atmosphere; How anti-gravity airships could draw power from the towers he was building; How radio and radar technology can be used as death-ray weapons in Star Wars; An appendix of Supreme Court documents on dismantling of his free-energy towers. 210 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:847131d4011c39fafa88716a5d3df5381c2fe651","amp;dn":"Childress+-+Fantastic+Inventions+of+Nikola+Tesla+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"847131d4011c39fafa88716a5d3df5381c2fe651","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,113,49,212,1,28,57,250,250,136,113,106,93,61,245,56,28,47,230,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
