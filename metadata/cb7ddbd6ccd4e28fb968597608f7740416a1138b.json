And there's nothing more disheartening and irritating than that murky closet from the netherworld, where boxes tumble down on our heads whenever the door opens, where the sheer clutter makes it impossible to identify what's inside, much less retrieve the item you need. Consumer desperation is why entire companies have sprung up devoted to closet organizing-it's the reason homeowners sometimes spend literally thousands of dollars to have a custom closet organizer designed and installed.\n\nOr, they can buy this book and do it themselves for a fraction of the cost. Today, virtually all the materials and hardware used by custom closet fabricators is available to consumers on the racks of home centers and hardware stores. Build Your Own Custom Closet is the first book to show consumers all the inside tips on designing a custom closet, and how to install it using materials they can buy themselves. This is the book that will lift readers from closet purgatory into the heaven of the well-organized closet-without selling their souls.\n\n\nBy Gillett Cole\nPublished by Creative Publishing in 2010\nEPUB, Retail, 144 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb7ddbd6ccd4e28fb968597608f7740416a1138b","amp;dn":"Build+Your+Own+Custom+Closet%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb7ddbd6ccd4e28fb968597608f7740416a1138b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,125,219,214,204,212,226,143,185,104,89,118,8,247,116,4,22,161,19,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
