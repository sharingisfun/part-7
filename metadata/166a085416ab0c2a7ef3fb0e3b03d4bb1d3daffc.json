An outcast at his high school, Dan is excited to finally make some friends in his last summer before college. But when he arrives at the program, Dan learns that his dorm for the summer used to be a sanatorium, more commonly known as an asylum. And not just any asylumÃ¢â‚¬â€a last resort for the criminally insane.\n\nAs Dan and his new friends, Abby and Jordan, explore the hidden recesses of their creepy summer home, they soon discover it's no coincidence that the three of them ended up here. Because the asylum holds the key to a terrifying past. And there are some secrets that refuse to stay buried.\n\nFeaturing found photos of unsettling history and real abandoned asylums and filled with chilling mystery and page-turning suspense, Madeleine Roux's teen debut, Asylum, is a horror story that treads the line between genius and insanity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:166a085416ab0c2a7ef3fb0e3b03d4bb1d3daffc","amp;dn":"Asylum+-+Madeleine+Roux+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"166a085416ab0c2a7ef3fb0e3b03d4bb1d3daffc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,106,8,84,22,171,12,42,126,243,251,14,59,3,212,187,29,61,175,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
