Diagnostics, or fault finding, is an essential part of an automotive technician's work, and as automotive systems become increasingly complex there is a greater need for good diagnostics skills. For students new to the subject, this book will help to develop these skills, but will also assist experienced technicians in further improving their performance and keeping up with recent industry developments. In full colour and including examples of the latest technology, this is the guide that no student enrolled on an automotive maintenance and repair course should be without.\n\n\n. Automotive courses in the UK attract more than 28,000 students\n. Packed with photographs, flow charts, detailed diagrams and quick reference tables to engage students' interest\n.
