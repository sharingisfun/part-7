I always laugh when he smiles that beaver-grin way he does with his front teeth bucking out. Awful.\n\nI especially like the part where Ladd tells Lake not to run, otherwise &quot;they will know you're not a man.&quot; Nice line.  We also see a favorite film-noir setting, the railyard, used to good advantage. For another use of the railyard, see The Setup, http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5248666/The_Setup_(1949_film_noir)\n\nAnd is there something Fritz Lang-ish about the big set for the office?\n\n*********\n\nPlease, please seed. Thank you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd548c8e524e592aec24b98f633c9a8f5cf12eb5","amp;dn":"This+Gun+For+Hire+%281942+film+noir%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd548c8e524e592aec24b98f633c9a8f5cf12eb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,84,140,142,82,78,89,42,236,36,185,143,99,60,154,143,92,241,46,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
