The training uses a non-jargon approach to teaching the backbone concepts of OOP which have been field tested in years of university-level teaching. While Visual Studio and C# form the instruction environment, the course is language agnostic as possible so the concepts are easily applied to other popular OOP languages and platforms.\n\nIn this course, you will learn:\nThe history of programming\nAbout Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism\nHow class properties and methods are used\nAbout object state and property methods\nThe difference between rvalues and lvalues\nHow design is important to the programming task\nHow to derive &quot;IS A&quot; classes\nWhat are delegates and interfaces","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72f83c72479b78e80969a953458a5278642eeff4","amp;dn":"AppDev+-+Object+Oriented+Programming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72f83c72479b78e80969a953458a5278642eeff4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,248,60,114,71,155,120,232,9,105,169,83,69,138,82,120,100,46,239,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
