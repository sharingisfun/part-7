It was written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by Brent Anderson.\n\nThe story concerns a minister, the Reverend William Stryker, stirring up religious anti-mutant fervor and kidnapping Professor X in an attempt to eradicate all mutants. The heroes do not fight any costumed super-villains in the story.  Although Magneto is featured in the graphic novel, he is not the X-Men's foe here, but rather forms an alliance with them against William Stryker. The X-Men members featured in this story are:  Professor X; Cyclops; Storm; Wolverine; Nightcrawler; Colossus; and Ariel.  Other characters who appear are:  Colossus' sister, Illyana Rasputin (after she is aged by Belasco, but before she adopts the identity of Magik and/or joins the New Mutants;) and the X-Men's civilian ally and friend, Stevie Hunter.\n\nNOTE:  These are not my scans.  All praise and glory to the original scanners (and authors/artists/publishers,) please.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8929cee252cdffa5bb53bd14d76196ce3ab73f9d","amp;dn":"Marvel+Graphic+Novel+No.+5%3A++The+X-Men+%26quot%3BGod+Loves%2C+Man+Kill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8929cee252cdffa5bb53bd14d76196ce3ab73f9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,41,206,226,82,205,255,165,187,83,189,20,215,97,150,206,58,183,63,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
