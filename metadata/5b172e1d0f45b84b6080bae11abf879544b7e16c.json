Tolkien. It includes searchable PDFs of the first nine volumes of The History of Middle Earth, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and the Tolkien Reader. Also it includes commercial EPUBs of the rest of his Middle-Earth writings. The scans new--not the old OCR EPUBs. Also included are high resolution scans in case anyone wants to make proper EPUBs, though given the formatting it won't be easy. I would be interested in scans of the last three volumes if anyone has them.\n\nIncluded are:\nThe History of Middle-Earth #1-9 (new PDFs)\nSir Gawain and the Green Knight (new PDF)\nThe Tolkien Reader (new PDF)\nTales from the Perilous Realm (commercial EPUB)\nThe Children of Hurin (commercial EPUB)\nThe Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun (commercial EPUB)\nThe Hobbit (Enhanced) (commercial EPUB)\nThe Fellowship of the Ring (commercial EPUB)\nThe Two Towers (commercial EPUB)\nThe Return of the King (commercial EPUB)\nThe Lord of the Rings (Omnibus) (commercial EPUB)\nThe Silmarillion (commercial EPUB)\nUnfinished Tales (commercial EPUB)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b172e1d0f45b84b6080bae11abf879544b7e16c","amp;dn":"History+of+Middle-Earth+and+Assorted+Writings+by+J.R.R.+Tolkien","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b172e1d0f45b84b6080bae11abf879544b7e16c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,23,46,29,15,69,184,75,96,128,186,225,26,191,135,149,68,183,225,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
