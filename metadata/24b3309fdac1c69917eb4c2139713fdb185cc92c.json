Signed to RSO Records shortly after his wildly experimental (and occasionally engaging) 1974 Elektra album, No Other, which is often cited as his masterpiece, Clark and producer Thomas Jefferson Kaye released this. Two Sides is a much lower-key affair, and it succeeds on many more levels than the more heralded No Other. Clark's explorations into country music are much more at home on this album, as tracks such as &quot;Mary Lou&quot; and &quot;Kansas City Southern&quot; demonstrate. Oddly, one of the highlights of this record is a non-Clark composition, the traditional &quot;In the Pines,&quot; which showcases Clark's brilliant (and underrated) vocal ability. The following year would see Clark team up with ex-Byrd mates Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman on the forgettable McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman project. Two Sides shows Clark in full command of his awesome gifts. Essential for Gene Clark enthusiasts. ~ Matthew Greenwald, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24b3309fdac1c69917eb4c2139713fdb185cc92c","amp;dn":"Gene+Clark+-+Two+Sides+To+Every+Story+%281977%2FVBR%29vinyl-rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24b3309fdac1c69917eb4c2139713fdb185cc92c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,179,48,159,218,193,198,153,23,235,76,33,57,113,63,219,24,92,201,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
