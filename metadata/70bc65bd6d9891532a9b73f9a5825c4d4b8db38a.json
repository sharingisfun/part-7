Derrick Cabrera, like all skaters, has a dream of being sponsored and one day going pro. He is an up and coming skater with all the talent but has the world against him. Parents, friends and schoolmates can't understand how Derrick has so much passion for something that has no future in their eyes. His crew of friends that are skaters is the only place he is truly accepted. But, as he gets better and better, the skater he looked up to the most becomes his worst enemy. In the sport of skateboarding a single trick that has never been done or conceived can bring you stardom in an instant. Derrick has that trick, if only he can make it. As he attempts to make this trick he is faced with skateproofing, a jealous friend and cops who have it in for him. Derrick finally gets arrested for skating on private property. After that his parents lay down the law and try to force him to quit skateboarding. Adding insult to injury, his girlfriend forces an ultimatum on him as well: &quot;The skateboard or life with her.&quot; At that point, Derrick gives up everything and runs away with his friends to the Tampa Am contest in Florida. This is a weekend that can turn an unknown skateboarder into a future star. He sees it as his only shot to make it in skateboarding. Derrick's rivalry comes to a head in Florida when his crew of friends abandons him because of his jealous mentor. A top amateur's sister rescues Derrick by giving him a place to stay and convincing him to believe in himself. With all the world of skateboarding watching, Derrick finally makes the trick that shocks the entire skate world and instantly thrusts him into the spotlight. His dream of being sponsored has come true.\n\n\n\n\nNFO:\n\nResolution: 600x338\n\nLanguag: English\n\nFormat: AVI\n\nDuration: 01:30:09\n\nAudio: MP3 @ 128kbps\n\nVideo: XviD @ 1394kbps\n\nFrame Rate: 29fps\n\nSample Size: 24 bit\n\nOverall Birate:1522\n\n\n\n\n\nCast:\n\nPaul Rodriguez...................
