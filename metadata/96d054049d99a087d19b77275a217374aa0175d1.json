It isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exactly mind-mapping softwareÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more like a freeform text editor that allows you to make notes anywhere on the page and to connect them using straight lines or arrows. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever scribbled down ideas all over a piece of paper and drawn lines between related thoughts, then you already know what Scapple does.\n\nScapple doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t force you to make connections, and it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect you to start out with one central idea off of which everything else is branched. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no built-in hierarchy at all, in factÃ¢â‚¬â€in Scapple, every note is equal, so you can connect them however you like. The idea behind Scapple is simple: when you are roughing out ideas, you need complete freedom to experiment with how those ideas best fit together.\n\nCreating notes is as easy as double-clicking anywhere on the canvas and then typing; making connections between ideas is as painless as dragging and dropping one note onto another. And unlike paper, you can move notes around and never run out of space.\n\nFEATURES\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ SimpleÃ¢â‚¬â€and funÃ¢â‚¬â€to use\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Completely freeform\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Write notes anywhere on the virtual paper\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Connect notes using drag and drop\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Move and arrange notes easily\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Create background shapes to group notes\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Customise the appearance of notes including font style, colours and a choice of border styles\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Stack notes in columns of related ideas\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ MathType support\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Full screen mode (Lion and above)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ iCloud support (10.8 and above)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Export to popular formats or print your ideas\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Easily drag notes into Scrivener for further development","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96d054049d99a087d19b77275a217374aa0175d1","amp;dn":"Scapple+1.0+OS+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96d054049d99a087d19b77275a217374aa0175d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,208,84,4,157,153,160,135,209,155,119,39,90,33,115,116,170,1,117,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
