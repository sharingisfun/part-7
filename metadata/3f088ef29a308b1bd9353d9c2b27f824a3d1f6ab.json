Everclear's sound reflected the rock, post-punk, and singer/songwriter influences of frontman Alexakis, including acts like X, the Replacements, the Pixies, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and Elvis Costello. Also instrumental to Everclear's success was the group's obsessive touring schedule and aggressive self-promotion tactics.\n\nArt Alexakis (b. Apr. 12, 1962, West Los Angeles, CA) was raised in a lower-middle-class household by his single mother. His father left the family during Alexakis' childhood, an incident that would later pepper many of Everclear's most popular songs. The dual deaths of his brother and girlfriend (his brother by heroin overdose; his girlfriend by suicide) convinced him to kick his own cocaine habit in the mid-'80s, and he later formed a country-punk band named Colorfinger in San Francisco. The group released one LP on Alexakis' own Shindig label, but the album (and an EP) became out of print after distributor Rough Trade folded. The band subsequently imploded, and Alexakis moved to his girlfriend's hometown of Portland, OR. In 1992, he met Craig Montoya (b. Sept. 14, 1970) and Everclear's first drummer, Scott Cuthbert; the trio recorded a demo EP for $400 and released the disc on Portland's Tim/Kerr label. Alexakis grew frustrated with the company's lack of promotion, so he hired an independent promoter to push the EP and personally mailed copies to media outlets and distributors. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tCapitol\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.So Much For The Afterglow\n02.Everything To Everyone\n03.Ataraxia (Media Intro)\n04.Normal Like You\n05.I Will Buy You A New Life\n06.Father Of Mine\n07.One Hit Wonder\n08.El Distorto De Melodica\n09.Amphetamine\n10.White Men In Black Suits\n11.Sunflowers\n12.Why I Don't Believe In God\n13.Like A California King\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f088ef29a308b1bd9353d9c2b27f824a3d1f6ab","amp;dn":"Everclear+-+So+Much+For+The+Afterglow+%281997%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f088ef29a308b1bd9353d9c2b27f824a3d1f6ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,8,142,242,154,48,139,27,217,53,61,156,43,39,248,36,163,209,246,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
