But before he becomes an operator again, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to get Jennifer Cahill into the Taskforce as well, though no one else seems willing to give a female civilian a shot. Jennifer herself would rather focus on setting up their new company, Grolier Recovery Services, an archaeological research agency that Pike hopes will also serve as a sophisticated cover for future Taskforce missions. When Grolier receives its first job offer to check out a site in Roswell, New Mexico, Jennifer convinces Pike to go. But once they arrive itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot more going on than a simple search for Indian artifacts, and uncovering the secrets carefully guarded out in the desert could not only cost them their future with the Taskforce, but their very lives.\n\nTo leave a Request please visit My Release Thread.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Rose88-My-Book-Uploads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Rose88-My-Book-Uploads&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThank You.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d294df7a51a8de8fbbdacd587c5234c2a259065","amp;dn":"The+Dig+by+Brad+Taylor+%5BA+Taskforce+Story%5D+%28Retail%29+%7BRose88%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d294df7a51a8de8fbbdacd587c5234c2a259065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,41,77,247,165,26,141,232,251,189,172,213,135,197,35,76,42,37,144,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
