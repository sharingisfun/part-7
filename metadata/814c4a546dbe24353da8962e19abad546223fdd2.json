CurveEQ shows you the actual filter response you are designing by means of a spline (a smooth curvy line) plus it shows the spectrum, so you can readily see what the EQ is doing with the sound. This, in turn, allows you to get the best from your mix and your tracks. CurveEQ perfectly suits the needs of mastering.\n\nAdditionally, CurveEQ implements spectrum matching technology that allows you to transfer spectrumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shape of one recording to another. In other words, this allows you to Ã¢â‚¬Å“copyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ frequency balance of existing time-proven mixes so that other mixes that are still in the works may have a chance to sound better. This technology also greatly helps in music mastering since it easily lessens any dramatic differences in the area of frequency balance between various tracks.\n\nCurveEQÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s filters can be switched between linear- and minimum-phase modes. CurveEQ also features a deeply-customizable spectrum analyzer like the one found in Voxengo GlissEQ and SPAN plug-ins. You can also display, save and load static spectrum plots for comparison and matching purposes.\n\n\nApplications:\n-Mastering equalizer\n-Spectrum matching equalizer\n-Stereo, mid-side, 5.1 surround equalizer\n-Transparent equalizer\n-FFT spectrum analyzer\n-Also featured in Steinberg Cubase 7+\n\n\nFeatures:\n-3 EQ curves per channel group\n-Freeform EQ curve drawing mode\n-Stereo and multi-channel processing\n-Mid/side processing\n-Undo/redo history\n-All sample rates support\n-Linear- and minimum-phase filtering\n-CSV file import/export\n-Internal channel routing\n-64-bit floating point processing\n-A/B comparisons\n-53 ms compensated processing latency\n-Spectrum matching\n-Real-time FFT spectrum analyzer\n-Channel grouping\n-Preset manager\n-Contextual hint messages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:814c4a546dbe24353da8962e19abad546223fdd2","amp;dn":"Voxengo+CurveEQ+v3.3+MacOSX+Incl.+Keygen-R2R+%5BATOM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"814c4a546dbe24353da8962e19abad546223fdd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,76,74,84,109,190,36,53,61,168,150,46,25,171,173,84,98,35,253,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
