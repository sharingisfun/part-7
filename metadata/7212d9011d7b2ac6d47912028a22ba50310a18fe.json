That same year signed a contract with MBI and released their first album titled &quot;Paula&quot;. In 1976 he released his second album entitled &quot;Iron Man.&quot; With the release of this disc and the contract expires with the MBI.\nAt that time the fun way slowly changing and the so-called &quot;commercial&quot; song gaining ground. The 2002 GR still appear in clubs, but they are conscious of the music industry. To 1982 and the re-flowering of Greek pop and rock music, which lasts for a long time. Several bands then they know great success. On that year formed definitively composers 2002 GR: Asvestopoulos Elias, John Chatzisoglou, Sotiris guard and Stelios Karaindrou. At the same time, renewed their contract with MBI and released their third album titled &quot;VOL 3&quot;. This album goes gold before we even spend six months of the date of release. Here are 4 disks: &quot;Amomoria&quot; (1984), &quot;2002GR&quot; (1986), &quot;Say to Crazy&quot; (1989), &quot;Bananas&quot; (1990). In 1990 his contract expires with the MBI.

While leaving the complex Stelios Karaindrou and added Andriotis George (drums) and George Serngkelidis (keyboards). In the summer of 1993 the album &quot;The next evening,&quot; and in the spring of 1995 returned to the recordings &quot;The best of ... 1995&quot;, which includes songs that were a great success in the past, but new.\nThe songs, &quot;said he,&quot; &quot;Magic yard&quot;, &quot;Anna&quot;, &quot;What can I offer you,&quot; &quot;Metro&quot; as the 2002 GR orchestrated again without departing from their original melodic lines, just using the features of modern technology, adding positive elements. The interpretive maturity that gave time to the Elias Asvestopoulos (soul group) is evident and gives another dimension to these songs.\nComposition:\nElias Asvestopoulos: Song\nJohn Chatzisoglou: Guitars, vocals\nSotiris guard: Bass, guitar, vocals\nStelios Karaindrou: Drums, vocals[/b]\n[center][img]https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTHlp_7OspCmJ-VBwcBLu6UrG4XNy5cwXt6D9UphwMo_L6Coos6gA[/img][img]https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQOgKOLF_Kwc8Xu_ZF83bcy4C4zagObuYdbqJl_QhOi2fcUBreHxw[/img][img]https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQnPfLVgH6fX4vWAt_yTmjOFVsQ-Xiyl9tAKzMBzTpHoUnKbEmE7w[/img][img]http://wiki.kithara.gr/images/9/99/2002GR.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7212d9011d7b2ac6d47912028a22ba50310a18fe","amp;dn":"2002+GR+-+Best+Of.greek+music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7212d9011d7b2ac6d47912028a22ba50310a18fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,18,217,1,29,123,42,198,212,121,18,2,138,34,186,80,49,10,24,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
