Written by Susan Hill; Full-cast dramatisation starring Robert Glenister, John Woodvine, Jane Marlow, Jason Done and Paula Tilbrook; Dramatised by Jon Strickland.\n\nEel Marsh house stands alone, surveying the windswept salt marshes beyond Nine Lives Causeway. Once, Mrs Alice Drablow lived here as a recluse. Now, Arthur Kipps, a junior solicitor with a London firm, is summoned to attend her funeral, unaware of the tragic and terrible secrets which lie behind the house's shuttered windows.\n\nIt is not until he glimpses a young woman with a wasted face, dressed all in black, at the funeral, that a sense of profound unease begins to creep over him and take hold, a feeling deepened by the reluctance of the locals to talk about the woman in black or what happens whenever she is seen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d0e9ad26832866e37278b05ce10ffd751c6f681","amp;dn":"Susan+Hill+-+The+Woman+in+Black+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d0e9ad26832866e37278b05ce10ffd751c6f681","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,14,154,210,104,50,134,110,55,39,139,5,206,16,255,215,81,198,246,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
