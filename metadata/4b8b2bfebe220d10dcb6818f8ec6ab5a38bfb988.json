Featuring leading scientists, social scientists, environmentalists and others, the film explores the scope, the causes, and the predicted global impact of a mass extinction occurring on a scale not seen since the disappearance of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.\n\nIf current trends continue, scientists warn that half or more of all plant and animal species on Earth will become extinct within the next few decades. Entirely caused by human activities, this contemporary mass extinction is disrupting and destroying the complex, interconnected biological systems that support life on earth.\n\nThrough interviews with eminent biologists and ecologists, the film examines the primary drivers of species loss: habitat destruction, global warming, pollution, and invasive species, all compounded by the expanding human population and our consumption patterns.\n\nCall of Life tells the story not only of a crisis in nature, but also in human nature. In interviews with psychologists, anthropologists, and historians, the film looks beyond the immediate causes of the mass extinction to consider how cultural and economic myths, along with deep-seated behavioral patterns have allowed this crisis to develop, continue to reinforce it, and even determine our response to it.\n\nCall of Life examines the collective and individual choices we have before us, and how the decisions we make -- or fail to make -- in the next decade will affect the habitability of Earth possibly for millions of years to come.\n\nAmong the scientists and other authorities featured in the film are:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Derrick Jensen, author of Endgame, radical-ecology philosopher\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Richard Leakey, famed paleonanthropologist and author of The Sixth Extinction\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Norman Myers, renowned Oxford University authority on biodiversity, author of The Sinking Ark\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Stuart Pimm, Chair of Conservation Ecology at Duke University, author of A Scientist Audits the Earth\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Gretchen Daly, Director of the Stanford Center for Conservation Biology, author of The New Economy of Nature\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Paul Ehrlich, Stanford University conservation biologist and author of The Population Bomb\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Mary Evelyn Tucker, Co-Director, Yale University Forum on Religion and Ecology\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A documentary in the manner of An Inconvenient Truth. Quite well doneÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Call of Life features a stellar list of scientists.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n- John Laumer, Field Biologist\n\n&quot;A fascinating and informative film, Call of Life provides an unusually rigorous, in-depth analysis of the importance of biological diversity and the devastating consequences of the current, out-of-control extinction rate. Serious, rich and challenging, Call of Life rises far beyond the superficial jeremiads of many environmental documentaries and explores its subject in commendable depth. Fronted by some of the best-respected, most articulate names in ecology and environmental science, it should be required viewing for anyone with a vested interest in maintaining the diversity of life on Earth Ã¢â‚¬â€ and that, as the film explains so convincingly, means all of us.&quot; - Reel Earth Film Festival, New Zealand\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b8b2bfebe220d10dcb6818f8ec6ab5a38bfb988","amp;dn":"Call+of+Life%3A+Facing+the+Mass+Extinction+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b8b2bfebe220d10dcb6818f8ec6ab5a38bfb988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,139,43,254,190,34,13,16,220,182,129,143,142,198,171,90,56,191,185,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
