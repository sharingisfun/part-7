The two previously paired up in a previous Live from DarylÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s House and now Todd returns the favor, with some down-home hospitality that includes an old-fashioned Luau Show, burying a pig in the dirt, serving up some amazing poi, with fire, hula dancers and a special performance with local musicians of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBang on the Drum.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always great when friends come all the way out here to visit,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ laughed Todd. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even better when they come to play.
