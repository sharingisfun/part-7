With the advent or programmable shaders, a wide variety of new algorithms have arisen and evolved over the past few years.\nThis edition discusses current, practical rendering methods used in games and other applications. It also presents a solid theoretical framework and relevant mathematics for the field of interactive computer graphics, all in an approachable style.
