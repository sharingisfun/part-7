Vol 1\nToday there are untold voices in print, on television, and online calling for our attention, and so many of these mock or belittle our faith. From coworkers to those calling themselves Christians, the tone has become one of reproach, disparaging the character of God and undermining the authority of the Bible. For those who have a heart for God, it can be intimidating and discouraging.\n\nHow Do We Know the Bible is True? is based on the absolute authority of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Word, not man-centered explanations. Clearly presented, it will help bring clarity in a world filled with increasingly vague notions of truth. Over 20 relevant issues are discussed including:\n\nIs the Bible totally without error?\nDid the resurrection really happen?\nHow do we know that the 66 books of the Bible are from God?\nDoes the Bible contradict itself?\nHow were people saved before Jesus came?\nWhat is the purpose and meaning of life?\nDid miracles really happen?\nWas Genesis derived from ancient myths?\nHow should we interpret the Bible; should Genesis be literal?\nDo you have to believe in a young earth to be saved?\nWithin these pages you will find responses to those honest questions of faith, helping to build a confidence in GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Word and inspiring your daily walk in His grace and peace.\n\n\nHow Do We Know the Bible is True? Vol 2\nIf you were asked how you know the Bible is true, do you have an answer?\n\nOver 29 issues addressed, including:\n\n- Who made God; where did God come from?\n- Has NoahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ark been found?\n- Hasn't Bible text been changed over the years?\n- Is Hell real?\n- Did the ten plagues of Egypt really happen?\n\nWe are an increasingly skeptical society Ã¢â‚¬â€ whether it comes to politics, science, or even faith. People see conflict everywhere, even about fundamental aspects of the Bible. When church leaders are at odds about biblical truth and scriptural authority, believers are left confused and uncertain, needing clear biblical truth.\n\nAddressing topics from popular culture like the Shroud of Turin, or Ã¢â‚¬Å“missingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ books of the Bible, and even what makes GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Word unique among holy books, How Do We Know the Bible is True? Vol. 2 is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“must haveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ resource for churches, libraries, and home study.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:275c5970c33214dfa7e832c0e3a4d9c1e2000f8f","amp;dn":"How+Do+We+Know+The+Bible+Is+True%3F%2C+Vol.1-2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"275c5970c33214dfa7e832c0e3a4d9c1e2000f8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,92,89,112,195,50,20,223,167,232,50,192,227,164,217,193,226,0,15,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
