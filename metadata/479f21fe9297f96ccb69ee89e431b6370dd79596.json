Distantly related from birth, they were born in widely separated parts of the world. Both Peter and Phil come from Indiana and Ohio, while Phil and David are native Californians, a fact which is often overlooked.\n\nPhil, the hostile Aries, is a professional actor, as is Phil, the funny Leo. David is the intellectual and poet of the group, and Peter knows how to drive. Two of them are Sagittarians.\n\nThe four first met at the now-famous Oz Film Festival Colloquium, sponsored by KPFK. Others will remember their frequent interferences on KRLA, via Radio Free Oz, and their many tours of riots, layoffs and Love-ins throughout the state of Los Angeles. Peter attained some strictly local fame as The Wizard of Oz, while the other three are internationally unknown, except to an equally small circle of intimates. This is, however, their first appearance on Vinyl.\n\nDavid, Peter and Phil have traveled extensively, while Phil has not. Individually, The Theater has logged thousands of hours en route to the Soviet Union, India, Europe and The Middle East and West. They expect to resume their travels as soon as they can get out of the country and their contract.\n\nLiving together in an abandoned oleomargarine factory high in the Hollywood Hills (except for Phil, who doesn't), they have become the leading exponents of The Firesign Philosophy of hard work and no pay makes no Jack at all, which has swept the country under the rug.\n\nProduced by Gary Usher and The Firesign Theatre\nEngineering: Jack Lattig, Tom May","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:479f21fe9297f96ccb69ee89e431b6370dd79596","amp;dn":"Firesign+Theater+-+2+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"479f21fe9297f96ccb69ee89e431b6370dd79596","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,159,33,254,146,151,249,108,203,105,238,137,228,49,182,55,13,215,149,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
