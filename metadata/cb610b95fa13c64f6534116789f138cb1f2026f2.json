If this isn't everything you've always wanted to know about the space program, but were afraid to ask, it comes close.\n\nContents: (all files EPUB)\n\nApollo: Race to the Moon - Charles A. Murray\nA book for those who were part of Apollo and want to recapture the experience and for those of a new generation who want to know how it was done.\n\nFailure is Not an Option - Gene Kranz\nA breathtaking, first-hand account of the early days of the NASA space program, through the eyes of the man who held it all together. Inside accounts of the efforts to save Apollo 13.\n\nFallen Astronauts: Heroes Who Died Reaching for the Moon - Colin Burgess\nThis book enriches the saga of mankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest scientific undertaking, Project Apollo, and conveys the human cost of the space race Ã¢â‚¬â€œ by telling the stories of those sixteen astronauts and cosmonauts who died reaching for the moon.\n\nFalling to Earth - Al Worden\nNine months after his return from the moon, Al Worden, command module pilot for Apollo 15, received a phone call telling him he was fired and ordering him out of his office by the end of the week. He refused to leave.\n    What happened in those nine months, from being honored with parades and meetings with world leaders to being unceremoniously fired, has been a source of much speculation for four decades. Worden has never before told the full story around the dramatic events that shook NASA and ended his spaceflight career. Readers will learn them here for the first time, along with the exhilarating account of what it is like to journey to the moon and back. It's an unprecedentedly candid account of what it was like to be an Apollo astronaut, with all its glory but also its pitfalls.\n\nFirst Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong - J.R. Hansen\nIn a penetrating exploration of American hero worship, Hansen addresses the complex legacy of Neil Armstrong, the First Man, as an astronaut and an individual.\n\nInto That Silent Sea - Colin Burgess\nA book that tells the intimate stories of the men and women, American and Russian, who made the space race their own and gave the era its compelling character. \n\nThe Last Man on the Moon - Eugene Cernan\nCernan's career spanned the entire Gemini and Apollo programs, from being the first person to spacewalk all the way around our world to the moment when he left man's last footprint on the Moon as commander of Apollo 17.  This is the astronaut story never before told - about the fear, love and sacrifice demanded of the few men who dared to reach beyond the heavens for the biggest prize of all--the Moon.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n__________________________   .________\n__    ___/  _____/   _    |   ____/\n  |    | /     ___/  /_   |____   \n  |    |     _    _/   /       \n  |____|  ______  /_____  /______  /\n\n                 /       /       / \n\nHave fun.
