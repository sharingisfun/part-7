The band comprised David Byrne, Chris Frantz, Tina Weymouth and Jerry Harrison. Auxiliary musicians also frequently made appearances in concert and on the group&amp;#039;s albums.\nThe avant-garde musical style of Talking Heads combined elements of punk rock, new wave, pop, funk, world music and art rock. Frontman and songwriter David Byrne contributed whimsical, esoteric lyrics to the band&amp;#039;s songs, and emphasized their showmanship through various multimedia projects and performances. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes Talking Heads as being &quot;one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the &amp;#039;80s, while managing to earn several pop hits.&quot;\nIn 2002, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of the band&amp;#039;s albums appeared on Rolling Stone magazine&amp;#039;s 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and the Channel 4 100 Greatest Albums poll listed one album (Fear of Music) at number 76. Their concert film Stop Making Sense is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of the genre.\nThis torrent is compiled from most of Talking Heads albums and include demos / outtakakes and alternative versions so in some cases there may be 3 versions of the same track. This is a fans compilation ~ ok I might just have put all the albums on but this is a best of from my own personal view. All I can say is I hope your views are the same as mine and enjoy peeps.\nUnionjack\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          Talking Heads -  All time Ultimate Compilation\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n   1.
