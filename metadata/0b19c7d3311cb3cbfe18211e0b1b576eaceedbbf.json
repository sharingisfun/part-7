It's a great recording of Bukowski reading some of his best poems to a raucous crowd, with plenty of banter and Bukowski getting drunker and more violent towards the audience as the recording progresses.\nI  ripped it from a CD I found at the local record store. I had to up the original volume, and find out the names of a few of the poems. Track 6 (&quot;You Got Drunk&quot;) is the only one with a possibly incorrect name. \nAlso, I couldn't find the correct artwork anywhere online, so I used the DVD cover of the film made for the performance.\n\nEnjoy this amazing poet, and please re-seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b19c7d3311cb3cbfe18211e0b1b576eaceedbbf","amp;dn":"Charles+Bukowski+-+Live+Poetry+Reading+At+The+Viking+Inn%2C+1979","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b19c7d3311cb3cbfe18211e0b1b576eaceedbbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,25,199,211,49,28,179,203,254,24,33,30,11,27,87,110,172,238,219,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
