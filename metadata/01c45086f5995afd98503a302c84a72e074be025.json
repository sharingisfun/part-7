It features the eponymous Danger Mouse, an English mouse who works as a superhero/secret agent. The show is a loose parody of British spy fiction, particularly James Bond and the Danger Man series starring Patrick McGoohan. The show originally ran in the United Kingdom from 28 September 1981 to 19 March 1992. In the English-language version, the titular hero was voiced by David Jason.\n\n01 - DM - Rogue Robots\n02 - DM - Who stole the bagpipes\n03 - DM - Trouble with ghosts\n04 - DM - Chicken run\n05 - DM - The martian misfit\n06 - DM - The dream machine\n07 - DM - Lord of the bungle\n08 - DM - Die laughing\n09 - DM - The world of machines\n10 - DM - Ice station camel\n11 - DM - Custard, episode 1-5\n12 - DM - Close encounters of the absurd kind, episode 1-5\n13 - DM - The duel, episode 1-5\n14 - DM - The day of the suds, episode 1-5\n15 - DM - The bad luck eye of the little yellow god, episode 1-5\n16 - DM - The four tasks of Danger Mouse, episode 1-5\n17 - DM - The invasion of Colonel K, episode 1-5\n18 - DM - Danger Mouse saves the world...again!, episode 1-5\n19 - DM - The odd ball runaround, episode 1-5\n20 - DM - The strange case of the ghost bus\n21 - DM - The trip to America\n22 - DM - The Wild, Wild Goose Chase!, Episode 1-5\n23 - DM - The return of Count Duckula!, Episode 1-5\n24 - DM - Demons aren't dull!, Episode 1-5\n25 - DM - 150 million years lost, Episode 1-5\n26 - DM - The Planet of the Cats, Episode 1-5\n27 - DM - Four heads are better than two, Episode 1-5\n28 - DM - Tower of Terror, Episode 1-5\n29 - DM - The Great Bone Idol, Episode 1-5\n30 - DM - Public Enemy No. 1, Episode 1-5\n31 - DM - Long Lost Crown Affair\n32 - DM - By George, It's a Dragon!\n33 - DM - Tiptoe Through the Penfolds\n34 - DM - Project Moon\n35 - DM - The next ice age begins at midnight!\n36 - DM - The aliens are coming!\n37 - DM - Remote-Controlled Chaos\n38 - DM - The man from Gadget\n39 - DM - Tampering with time tickles\n40 - DM - Nero Power\n41 - DM - Once upon a time slip\n42 - DM - Viva Danger Mouse\n43 - DM - Play it again, Wufgang!\n44 - DM - Hear!
