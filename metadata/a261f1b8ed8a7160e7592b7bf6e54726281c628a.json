A thicket of materials, ranging from scholarly to popular, have been written, compiled, produced, and published about his life and his teachings. Among the ocean of EinsteiniaÃ¢â‚¬â€scientific monographs, biographies, anthologies, bibliographies, calendars, postcards, posters, and Hollywood filmsÃ¢â‚¬â€however, there is a peculiar void when it comes to the connection that the brilliant scientist had with the African American community. Virtually nowhere is there any mention of his relationship with Paul Robeson, despite EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s close friendship with him, or W.E.B. Du Bois, despite EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s support for him.\n\nThis unique book is the first to bring together a wealth of writings by Einstein on the topic of race. Although his activism in this area is less well known than his efforts on behalf of international peace and scientific cooperation, he spoke out vigorously against racism both in the United States and around the world.\n\nCombining the scientistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s letters, speeches, and articles with an engaging narrative that places his public statements in the context of his life and times, this important collection not only brings attention to EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s antiracist public activities, but also provides insight into antiracist struggles in America.\n\n\n\n[b] Editorial Reviews [/b]\n\n\n&quot;For many people around the world, Einstein's name is a household word, and yet Fred Jerome and Rodger Taylor's important new book reveals in startling ways how little we know about his profound insights into the realities of race and racism. Who knew? Fortunately for all of us, Einstein's ideas and insights on this issue are as timely and instructive as his most advanced scientific contributions. We owe Fred and Rodger a huge debt of gratitude.\n&quot;\n(Danny Glover 20990101)\n\n&quot;In Einstein on Race and Racism, the authors remind us that it is significant to achieve consciousness through education. Through their historical analysis, they unveil the interconnection that existed between Paul Robeson and Einstein, so as to ensure that contemporary scholars understand humanizing pedagogy and civic responsibilities. This is insightful scholarship that explores race and racism, drawing on the analytical insights of innovative giants of divergent social and professional recognition.\n&quot;\n(Prosper Godonoo Director, Paul Robeson Cultural Center, Rutgers University 20990101)\n\n&quot;Fred Jerome and Rodger Taylor paint a compelling portrait of an Einstein who has been almost completely absent from the public record: the man who co-chaired a committee that pushed for federal anti-lynching legislation, who joined the campaign to save the 'Scottsboro boys,' who helped sponsor the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund, who became a close friend and supporter of Paul Robeson, who frequently strolled through Princeton's African-American neighborhoods-in short, a man not afraid to use his fame to battle the racism that plagued America (and Princeton, both town and university) during his years in the U.S. This is a side-an important side-of the great physicist and pacifist that anyone interested in the man, and his times, will find eye-opening.\n\n&quot;\n(Sharon Begley science writer and coauthor of The Mind and the Brain 20990101)\n\n&quot;This book continues the process of peeling back the politics of Albert Einstein to reveal a vital (and up to now invisible) layer of anti-racism activities. It demonstrates, through Einstein's example, how not to 'stand idly by' in the face of America's most pernicious problem-racism.\n\n&quot;\n(Dorothy M. Zellner civil rights activist, member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee 20990101)\n\n&quot;While Albert Einstein is most famous for his theory of relativity, he held fervently to some moral absolutes, few more precious than his heroic and passionate anti-racist writing and activism. Einstein on Race and Racism brilliantly recovers the engaging, principled, and courageous views of one of history's most famous scientists, whose anti-racist writings have been ignored, overlooked, even hidden from the world by his biographers and custodians. Thanks to Fred Jerome and Rodger Taylor, we have unimpeachable evidence that the 'Man of the Century' wrestled fearlessly and insightfully with what his friend W.E.B. Du Bois termed the century's greatest problem: the color line. This is one of the year's most important books.&quot;\n(Michael Eric Dyson author of The Michael Eric Dyson Reader 20990101) \n\n\n\nPaperback: 224 pages\nPublisher: Rutgers University Press; New edition edition (July 25, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0813539528\nISBN-13: 978-0813539522\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Einstein-Race-Racism-Prof-Jerome/dp/0813539528/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Einstein-Race-Racism-Prof-Jerome/dp/0813539528/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nTags: Albert Einstein, Einstein, nazi, germany, war, ww2, World War 2, World War II, race relations, race, sociology, W.E.B Dubois, antiracism, anti-racism, FAS, nuclear, manhattan, project, princeton, university, education,NAACP, Civil Rights Congress, Southern Conference Educational Fund, japan, hiroshima, physics, physicist,communism, fbi, political science, segregation, jim crow, african american , african american studies, black, oppression, race, racism, brutality, exclusion, white privilege, europe, european, blacks, african, african american, africans, negro, negrophobia, black brute, stereotype, police, brutality, lynching, kkk, white, race, racism, oppression, extrajudicial, crazed, prison, police, ghettoization, fear, guilt, white guilt, racism, discrimination, oppression, bias, psychology, sociology, bad faith, race, black, african, american, african american, AA, african american studies, society, institutional racism, white guilt, white privilige, denial, double standard, profiling, fear, responsibility, cognitive dissonance, freedom, white anxiety, abuse, disparity, disparities, slavery, experimentation, tuskeegee, unconscious, subconscious,","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a261f1b8ed8a7160e7592b7bf6e54726281c628a","amp;dn":"Einstein+on+Race+and+Racism+%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a261f1b8ed8a7160e7592b7bf6e54726281c628a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,97,241,184,237,138,113,96,231,89,43,123,246,229,71,38,40,28,98,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
