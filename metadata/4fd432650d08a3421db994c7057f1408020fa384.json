But simply acknowledging this fact isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t enough to help us improve. The big question is, how can we eliminate these mistakes from our game, or at least keep them to an absolute minimum?\n\nColin Crouch tackles this vital subject face-to-face. Drawing upon his considerable experience, he looks back at critical moments within games where mistakes are made, and examines how we can recognise the danger signs and avoid making impulsive decisions. The reader is constantly challenged by exercises, which provide perfect training for real over-the-board battles.\nAbout the Author\n\nDr Colin Crouch is an International Master, a tremendously experienced tournament player, a highly regarded chess writer and a regular columnist for British Chess Magazine.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Lose-Chess-Everyman/dp/1857446364/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304101843&amp;sr=8-7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Lose-Chess-Everyman/dp/1857446364/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304101843&amp;sr=8-7&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fd432650d08a3421db994c7057f1408020fa384","amp;dn":"Why+We+Lose+at+Chess+%28Everyman+Chess%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fd432650d08a3421db994c7057f1408020fa384","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,212,50,101,13,8,163,66,29,185,148,199,5,127,20,8,2,15,163,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
