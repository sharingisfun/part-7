Three generations. Three men. One bizarre and shocking universe. \n\n&quot;Oh my god! I just got out from seeing Taxidermia at MIFF 2006 and I was literally speechless. As I was one of the first to leave the theatre, I took it upon myself to stand out the front and watch the expressions on the faces of other patrons as they exited. Most were laughing in disbelief at what they had just seen, some were white as ghosts and some looked plain baffled. Whatever way you look at it, Taxidermia will certainly make a strong impact on you.&quot;\n\nIMDB info: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410730/\n\nI've hardcoded the subs in again, and the file size has decreased slightly but the quality is still tip-top!\n\nThanks guys and dont forget to seed for a bit!!!\n\n(Lang: Hung/Aust/Rus) Sub (Eng)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e5e1965f6f466d1f160bb4ff87a894854aac9ba","amp;dn":"Taxidermia+%282006%29+-+Hardcoded+English+Subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e5e1965f6f466d1f160bb4ff87a894854aac9ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,94,25,101,246,244,102,209,241,96,187,79,248,122,137,72,84,170,201,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
