ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a matter of efficiency. Professionals who arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sure how to punctuate take more time than necessary to write, as they fret about the many inconsistent and contradictory rules theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve picked up over the years.

Weak punctuation results in time-wasting confusion, questions about professionalism, and some times even serious and costly miscommunication.\n\nWithout using the jargon of grammar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and providing 18 common sense principles to live by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Punctuation at Work shows busy professionals exactly how the marks can be used to make meaning clear and emphasize ideas.
