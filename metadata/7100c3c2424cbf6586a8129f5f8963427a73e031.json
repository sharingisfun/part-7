We listened to the increasing demand of instructors for more flexibility with teaching materials. Sociology in Modules provides an appealing alternative for those instructors who feel that breaking up each chapter into 2-4 modules would allow them to assign the content they want in the order that they want.\nThis modular format was also created to cater to the way in which students learn. Using an adaptive diagnostic tool to help students identify what they know and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know, Sociology in Modules helps students move towards an understanding of the foundations (theory) of sociology by presenting material in more manageable chunks. Instead of facing long and daunting chapters, modules encourage student reading and end of module pedagogy reinforces key concepts.\n\nRichard Schaefer has adapted his proven content to meet the changing needs of instructors and students. Sociology in Modules is the most flexible program for teaching and learning sociology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7100c3c2424cbf6586a8129f5f8963427a73e031","amp;dn":"Sociology+in+Modules%2C+2E-+Schaefer+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7100c3c2424cbf6586a8129f5f8963427a73e031","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,0,195,194,66,76,191,101,134,168,18,159,95,137,99,66,122,115,224,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
