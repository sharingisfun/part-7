The 10 projects include over 75 patterns. Simple enough to make in a day, each pattern uses readily available store-bought materials and comes with full-color photographs and step-by-step instructions.\n\nAbout the Author\nJessica Peck lives in Wisconsin with her favorite three redheads: her husband and two young children. All of her designs are created on the playroom floor. From conception to completion of each project, her children inspire her creativity.\nBefore launching her first line of sewing patterns, Sweetie Pie Bakery, Jessica graduated from Harrington College of Design in Chicago with a degree in interior design. You can see her eye for color and structure, as well as an expertise for construction, throughout her designs. Her passions for architecture and sewing were a natural combination for pattern design.\nWhen Jessica is not sewing, she enjoys baking, photography, and relaxing with her family.
