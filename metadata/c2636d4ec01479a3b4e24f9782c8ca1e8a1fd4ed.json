The Legendary Canadian Poet and Songwriter is in the Same Class as Bob Dylan and Serge Gainsbourg, but Never Had the Kind of Mass Exposure and Celebration that the Other Two have Experienced, Except in Influential Circles. Doubtless There Will One Day Be a Vehicle (Movie, Cover Version) which Will Elevate Cohen to the Commercial Level of his Contemporaries. In the Meantime, You Can Enjoy this Selection by People who Know his Music Backwards and Forwards and Delve Into the Psyche of a True Genius with this Collection. It Will Only Leave You Yearning for More, So Get Ready to Open Up Your Pocketbook to his Catalog.\n\n \n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Suzanne\n[02] Sisters Of Mercy\n[03] One Of Us Cannot Be Wrong\n[04] The Old Revolution\n[05] Seems So Long Ago, Nancy\n[06] Bird On The Wire\n[07] Joan Of Arc\n[08] Famous Blue Raincoat\n[09] Diamonds In The Mine\n[10] Chelsea Hotel No. 2\n[11] I Tried To Leave You\n[12] Who By Fire\n[13] Iodine\n\nPlay Time - 00h:52m:30s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] The Smokey Life\n[02] Dance Me To The End Of Love\n[03] Hallelujah\n[04] If It Be Your Will\n[05] I'm Your Man\n[06] Take This Waltz\n[07] Tower Of Song\n[08] Light As The Breeze\n[09] The Gypsy's Wife [Live Version]\n[10] That Don't Make It Junk\n\nPlay Time - 00h:51m:35s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 01h:44m:05s\nTotal File Size....................... 567mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
