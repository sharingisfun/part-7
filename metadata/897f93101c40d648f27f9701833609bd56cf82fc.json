All cover art and accompanying liner notes scanned are scanned and included in the torrent. Music is in MP3 format, 192kbps. \n\nVolume 1:\nThis first disc takes its title, Au bord de l?eau, from the famous song which became FaurÃƒÂ©?s calling-card, and presents a generous programme of mÃƒÂ©lodies of an aquatic nature. The songs are performed in the order of their composition (this rationale of chronology within a general theme will be applied across the other volumes of the series to make up four self-contained and individually satisfying recitals), and alongside several perfect miniatures we here encounter three of the major cycles: the five ?Venetian? songs (to the poetry of Paul Verlaine), L?horizon chimÃƒÂ©rique, and Mirages, written for Madeleine Grey in thanks for her advocacy of the cycle La chanson d?ÃƒË†ve.\n\nVolume 2:\nThis second installment in this series encompassing all FaurÃƒÂ©?s songs takes its title from the opening line of Clair de lune ? ?Votre ÃƒÂ¢me est un paysage choisi? (?Your soul is a chosen landscape?) ? which is regarded by many as representing the pinnacle of FaurÃƒÂ©?s considerable achievement in the genre. Here we have songs reflecting the various seasons of the year, atmospheric landscapes from Tuscany to Versailles, and the various mystical symbols of Van Lerberghe?s Le jardin clos.\n\nVolume 3: \nThis third installment in the series encompassing all FaurÃƒÂ©?s songs takes its title from the famous Silvestre setting Chanson d?amour and guides the listener on a journey through the panoply of human emotion. Alongside finely chiselled miniatures we have the early cycle PoÃƒÂ¨me d?un jour (to poetry by Grandmougin), the suite from the Shakespeare/ Haraucourt drama Shylock (which includes some notable rarities in the form of two-piano arrangements made with FaurÃƒÂ©?s blessing by the composer LÃƒÂ©on BoÃƒÂ«llmann), and what is surely the apotheosis of the mÃƒÂ©lodie genre: La bonne chanson.\n\nVolume 4:\nThis fourth?and final?instalment in the series encompassing all FaurÃƒÂ©?s songs takes as its title a line from La chanson d?ÃƒË†ve, the matchless cycle which confirmed its composer?s status as the master of French song and which concludes the Hyperion intÃƒÂ©grale.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:897f93101c40d648f27f9701833609bd56cf82fc","amp;dn":"CLASSICAL+-+The+Complete+Songs+of+Gabriel+Faure+%5B4CD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"897f93101c40d648f27f9701833609bd56cf82fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,127,147,16,28,64,214,72,242,127,151,1,131,54,9,189,86,207,130,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
