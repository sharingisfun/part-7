(1961) [2015 Official Digital Download 24bit/192kHz]\n FLAC 24bit/192kHz (tracks) | Cover Only | 1.37 GB | 30:35 minutes\nVocal, Jazz | Studio Master, Official Digital Download | Hosted On: NirtoFlare &amp; Oboom\n\n The album is Sinatra's final swing session with Capitol Records. This album is possibly unique for the orchestral arrangement and stereophonic set-up by Billy May. Due to Capitol's signature &quot;full-spectrum Stereo sound,&quot; the audience can distinctly hear the placement of specific orchestral pieces in the studio at the time of the recording.\n\n\n Arranged by Billy May, Come Swing with Me! was Frank Sinatra's final swing session for Capitol Records. The album falls somewhere between the carefree Come Fly with Me and the hard-swinging Come Dance with Me!, borrowing elements of the humor of Fly and the intense, driving rhythms of Dance. Recorded without strings or saxes, the brass-heavy sound of the album was noticeable, but it wasn't nearly as distinctive as the ping-ponging stereo effects of the album. With its extreme stereo separation, Come Swing with Me! has a bizzare, off-kilter feel that is accentuated by Sinatra's restless vocals. At the time of recording the album, Sinatra was also recording I Remember Tommy for Reprise and his affections were with his new label. That doesn't mean he sounds careless on Come Swing with Me! -- in fact, his intense, speedy energy gives the album an edge that distinguishes the record. The album might not be as special as his two previous May collaborations, but it does have enough genuine gems to make it necessary.
