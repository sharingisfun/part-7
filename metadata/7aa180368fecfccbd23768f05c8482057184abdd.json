Along the way he'll meet the disciples of Route 66, from seasoned &quot;roadies&quot; to first-timers living the dream. He'll also learn about key figures and events that have shaped the richly diverse culture and character of the US past and present.\n\nBilly says: &quot;How many other roads do you know that people sing about? It's just one of those places you long to see. Ever since I was a wee boy in Glasgow I have fantasised about getting my kicks on Route 66. &quot;This will be a tale in tarmac of presidents and paupers, cowboys and Indians, diners and drive-thrus, framed in a landscape from 100 movies with a soundtrack of the greatest music in the world - rock n roll. We're going to have lots of fun, meet lots of people and see lots of things.&quot;\n\nA BluRay, DVD and Official CD Soundtrack are available.\n\n\n1)  Chicago to St Louis \nBilly begins his journey in Chicago, where he heads to the top of America's tallest building, discovers one of Al Capone's most notorious speakeasies and attends a gospel service in the suburb where rock and roll was born. Leaving the city behind, Billy visits the home of Abraham Lincoln, meets Illinois's champion pie-maker and encounters a 20-foot tall roadside giant. Finally, he heads into Amish country, where he takes the reins for a horse-drawn buggy ride.\n\n2)  St Louis to Oklahoma City \nBilly continues his journey in St Louis, Missouri, by climbing the Gateway Arch - the highest man-made monument in America. He lunches at a restaurant where the chef is a soul music legend, and visits a wolf sanctuary, where he feeds the endangered animals. Billy's final stop is in Oklahoma City, where he visits the memorial to the 168 victims of the Oklahoma City bombing.\n\n3)  Oklahoma City to Monument Valley \nThis episode sees Billy in cowboy country as he joins ranch-hands on a cattle drive to Oklahoma City. Over the border in Texas, he stops off at the ghost town of Glenrio. In Los Alamos, New Mexico, Billy meets two men who helped create the atomic bomb. Driving off-route, he finds himself in Monument Valley, a sacred Navajo site and a location familiar from countless westerns.\n\n4)  Monument Valley to Santa Monica \nBilly marvels at a massive meteorite crater in Arizona before heading to the Grand Canyon, which he reaches by a steam train fuelled with discarded vegetable oil. He meets an 84-year-old barber, dubbed the 'Godfather of Route 66', who tirelessly campaigns to keep the historic route alive. Entering LA, Billy checks out some of the city's coolest lo-rider cars, then soars over the gridlocked freeways in a helicopter. Reaching the end of the road overlooking the Pacific Ocean at Santa Monica, Billy reflects on his extraordinary 3,000-mile journey.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img695.imageshack.us/img695/5427/route66screen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img695.imageshack.us/img695/5427/route66screen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/5010/route66screen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/5010/route66screen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img408.imageshack.us/img408/7921/route66screen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img408.imageshack.us/img408/7921/route66screen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img38.imageshack.us/img38/4684/route66screen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img38.imageshack.us/img38/4684/route66screen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6038/route66screen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6038/route66screen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img651.imageshack.us/img651/4491/route66screen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img651.imageshack.us/img651/4491/route66screen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/7290/route66screen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/7290/route66screen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1303/route66screen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1303/route66screen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/4621/route66screen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/4621/route66screen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/224/route66screen9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/224/route66screen9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img810.imageshack.us/img810/7024/route66screen10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img810.imageshack.us/img810/7024/route66screen10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/7223/route66screen11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/7223/route66screen11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/673/route66screen12.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/673/route66screen12.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/5043/route66screen13.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/5043/route66screen13.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/7107/route66screen14.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/7107/route66screen14.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4589/route66screen15.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4589/route66screen15.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img219.imageshack.us/img219/7024/route66screen16.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img219.imageshack.us/img219/7024/route66screen16.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/8987/route66screen17.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/8987/route66screen17.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (5248Kbps average)\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778:1\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 45 mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 1.71 GB (average)\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: JungleBoy\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.itv.co","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aa180368fecfccbd23768f05c8482057184abdd","amp;dn":"ITV+Billy+Connollys+Route+66+4of4+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aa180368fecfccbd23768f05c8482057184abdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,161,128,54,143,236,252,203,210,55,104,240,92,132,130,5,113,132,171,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
