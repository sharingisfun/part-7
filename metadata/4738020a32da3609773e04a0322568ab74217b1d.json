Basic twisted stitches, complex interpretations of cables, reversible cables, adding texture and color, turning stitches around, constructing cables with I-cord, and wrapping stitches to create the illusion of cables are some of the integrated techniques detailed in this guide. Contained within are more than 15 original cable patterns for pullovers, jackets, bags, socks, and accessories. Also included is information on a new charting system for predicting cable behavior as well as tips on cabling without a cable needle, choosing the best yarns for specific cable effects, and designing original cable patterns.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4738020a32da3609773e04a0322568ab74217b1d","amp;dn":"+Power+Cables%3A+The+Ultimate+Guide+to+Knitting+Innovative+Cables","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4738020a32da3609773e04a0322568ab74217b1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,56,2,10,50,218,54,9,119,62,4,160,50,37,104,171,116,33,123,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
