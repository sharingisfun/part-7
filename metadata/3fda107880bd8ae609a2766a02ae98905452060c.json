(1972)\n\nMp3 @192 kbps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the exits of bassist/producer Felix Pappalardi and keyboardist Steve Knight, remaining Mountain members Leslie West (guitar)and Corky Laing (drums)forged a new alliance with ex-Cream bassist Jack Bruce.\n\nThe hard rock supergroup's debut LP, Why Dontcha, appeared in 1972, followed a year later by Whatever Turns You On. The Bruce, West and Laing trio proved short-lived, however, dissolving prior to the 1974 release of the Live 'n' Kickin' concert set.\n\nWhy Dontcha is West, Bruce and Laing's first studio album.\n\nThe album features &quot;The Doctor,&quot; which received heavy FM radio airplay upon the album's release and became a signature song in live performance for the band. Other noteworthy tracks include &quot;Out Into the Fields,&quot; which Jack Bruce continued to perform in concert following West, Bruce and Laing's breakup (and which he re-recorded for his 2002 album Shadows in the Air), and &quot;Love is Worth the Blues,&quot; a song loosely based on the chords and structure of The Rolling Stones' &quot;Play With Fire&quot;.\n\nWhy Dontcha was West, Bruce and Laing's most successful album, reaching #26 on the Billboard U.S. album chart.\n\n\nSide one\n\n   1. &quot;Why Dontcha&quot; (West/Bruce/Laing) - 3:04\n   2. &quot;Out Into the Fields&quot; (West/Bruce/Laing/Brown) - 4:41\n   3. &quot;The Doctor&quot; (West/Bruce/Laing/Palmer) - 4:29\n   4. &quot;Turn Me Over&quot; (West/Bruce/Laing) - 2:45\n   5. &quot;Third Degree&quot; (Eddie Boyd/Willie Dixon*) - 5:14\n   \n* Credited to Boyd alone on original pressings of the album.\n\n\n[edit] Side two\n\n   1. &quot;Shake Ma Thing (Rollin' Jack)&quot; (West/Bruce/Laing) - 3:17\n   2. &quot;While You Sleep&quot; (West/Bruce/Laing) - 3:24\n   3. &quot;Pleasure&quot; (West/Bruce/Laing/Brown) - 4:01\n   4. &quot;Love is Worth the Blues&quot; (West/Bruce/Laing) - 4:12\n   5. &quot;Pollution Woman&quot; (West/Bruce/Laing/Brown) - 4:28\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n* Leslie West: vocals, producer, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, Dobro,\n\n* Jack Bruce: bass, organ, harmonium, harp, vocals, choir, chorus, producer, synthesizer, acoustic guitar, harmonica, piano\n\n* Corky Laing: drums, rhythm guitar, vocals, producer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fda107880bd8ae609a2766a02ae98905452060c","amp;dn":"West%2C+Bruce+%26+Laing+-+Why+Dontcha+%281972%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fda107880bd8ae609a2766a02ae98905452060c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,218,16,120,128,189,138,230,9,162,118,106,2,174,152,144,84,82,6,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
