This eruption covered the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum in ash and pumice, killing all those trapped between the volcano and the sea. The documentary accurately portrayed the different phases of the eruption although the digitally created images of the city itself are not entirely accurate. It was directed by Peter Nicholson and written by Edward Canfor-Dumas. It was a BBC/TVE co-production.\n\n\nVideo:\n\nCodec: XVID MPEG-4\nDimensions: 704 x 384\nFramerate: 25 frams per second\n\nAudio:\n\nCodec: Dolby Digital (AC-3)\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBit Rate: 224 kbps\n\n\nApologies for the slow seeding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:227205248c5245526852d0c0db388b8c9af639f6","amp;dn":"Pompeii%3A+The+Last+Day+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"227205248c5245526852d0c0db388b8c9af639f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,114,5,36,140,82,69,82,104,82,208,192,219,56,139,140,154,246,57,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
