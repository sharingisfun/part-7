Each time you install a new program, the registry changes. Most times you uninstall a program, junk is left behind in the registry.\r\n\r\nOver time, the Windows registry gets cluttered and fragmented. RegClean Pro's registry scanner locates old and incorrect information, and fixes the errors. The software repairs registry problems, and defrags the entire registry.\r\n\r\nThis results in faster system performance and a Windows PC that resists crashes. RegClean Pro is simple and safe to use. Run RegClean Pro every month, and your computer will remain stable and reliable.\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\n\r\nFaster System Speed\r\nBy removing registry errors, RegClean Pro makes Windows run more efficiently. After optimizing your registry, Windows will no longer try to work with hardware and software that are no longer installed on your computer.\r\n\r\nBy defragmenting your registry, RegClean Pro makes your computer more responsive. A fragmented registry forces Windows to search for information in dozens or hundreds of different places on your hard drive. RegClean Pro removes this fragmentation and makes your registry run much more quickly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nSmooth Operation\r\nNothing slows down a PC more than system crashes. A clean Windows registry means fewer crashes, and a faster computer.\r\n\r\nRegClean Pro makes your Windows PC more stable and reliable. And that makes your computing experience more efficient and pleasant.\r\n\r\nStable Systems\r\n\r\nComputer crashes occur when the Windows registry sends the operating system chasing after hardware and software that is no longer installed on your computer. Run the registry optimizer every month, and your computer will be more stable.\r\n\r\nFewer Error Messages\r\nRegClean Pro minimizes the strange error messages that seem to pop up randomly on your screen. These errors arise because outdated information in the Windows registry doesn't match the reality of the software and hardware that you have running on your computer.\r\n\r\nRegClean Pro identifies and fixes these inconsistencies. And that means fewer error messages interrupting your workflow.\r\n\r\nSafe and Reliable\r\nSystweak has been developing and marketing Windows registry cleaners and optimizers since 1999. Our software is safe and reliable.\r\n\r\nBefore fixing registry errors or cleaning your registry, RegClean Pro automatically makes a backup copy of your old registry. In the unlikely event that there is a problem with the optimized and cleaned registry, it's quick and easy to restore the backup registry.\r\n\r\nHomepage http://www.systweak.com/registry-cleaner/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce34b807054c78cf5788cf601802856dde7f4fee","amp;dn":"SysTweak+Regclean+Pro+7.2.72.362+%28Install+%2B+Portable%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce34b807054c78cf5788cf601802856dde7f4fee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,52,184,7,5,76,120,207,87,136,207,96,24,2,133,109,222,127,79,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
