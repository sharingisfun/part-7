Like most of them, Morse possesses an uncanny intelligence, especially in matters of crime and crosswords, but Dexter has always made sure that his detective remains fully a man--flawed and uncertain despite an outward bravado.\n\nLike the work of few other mystery writers, Dexter's Morse series has consistently blended the dignity of high art with the grimness of crime and punishment. While it's a clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© to say that he transcends the genre, he has certainly expanded its range to novels that entertain while they instruct--even when that instruction is grammatical.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca0312e06b4c6524d8768ace2430d727791346c2","amp;dn":"13+Inspector+Morse+Novels+-+Colin+Dexter++%28LIT%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca0312e06b4c6524d8768ace2430d727791346c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,3,18,224,107,76,101,36,216,118,138,206,36,48,215,39,121,19,70,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
