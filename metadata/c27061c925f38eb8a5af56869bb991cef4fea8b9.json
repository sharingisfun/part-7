But they are found out, arrested and then bailed. While out on bail, they decide to prove their innocence by actually making a film. They hire a former nightclub bouncer, now a self-made micro-budget gangster film director. In 2011, Paul Knight makes their movie for under Â£100,000 with a cast of soap and gangster movie stars including Danny Midwinter, Marc Bannerman and Loose Women's Andrea McLean. The film's title is A Landscape of Lies. But the cinematic alibi does not convince the jury when the trial runs in 2013. The producers are convicted of tax fraud and given long sentences.\r\nA comic British crime caper and classic heist movie, but in this movie the heist IS the movie.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/The-Great-Gangster-Film-Fraud-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/42/The-Great-Gangster-Film-Fraud-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c6/The-Great-Gangster-Film-Fraud-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/30/The-Great-Gangster-Film-Fraud-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c2/The-Great-Gangster-Film-Fraud-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/08/The-Great-Gangster-Film-Fraud-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9b/The-Great-Gangster-Film-Fraud-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d3/The-Great-Gangster-Film-Fraud-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/The-Great-Gangster-Film-Fraud-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 23 (~2462Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~120Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 83 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.50 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Container: MP4\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06yrf2t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c27061c925f38eb8a5af56869bb991cef4fea8b9","amp;dn":"BBC+Storyville+2016+The+Great+Gangster+Film+Fraud+1080p+x264+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c27061c925f38eb8a5af56869bb991cef4fea8b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,112,97,201,37,243,142,184,165,175,86,134,155,185,145,206,244,254,168,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
