Directed by Motoyoshi Oda, and featuring special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya, the film starred Hiroshi Koizumi, Setsuko Wakayama, and Minoru Chiaki. The 2nd film in the Godzilla series, this was a direct sequel quickly put into production to capitalize on the box office success of Godzilla the previous year. This was the first film in the series to feature a &quot;monster vs. monster&quot; scenario, as it introduced Godzilla's first foe, the quadruped monster Anguirus. This scenario of Godzilla battling other giant monsters would become a staple for the rest of the series.\n\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States in the Summer of 1959 by Warner Brothers as Gigantis, the Fire Monster. This American version of the film was heavily edited as it not only gives Godzilla a modified roar and a new origin, but also changes his name from &quot;Godzilla&quot; to &quot;Gigantis&quot;, trying to pass the monster off as a completely new character. This move was considered a failure, and all subsequent American cuts of Godzilla films would use the character's proper name.\n\nDirector:\n Motoyoshi Oda \n\nWriters:\n Shigeaki Hidaka, Shigeru Kayama (novel) \n\nStars:\n Hiroshi Koizumi, Setsuko Wakayama, Minoru Chiaki\n\nB/W\nEnglish\nSize: 705 mb\nres: 720x576\n23 f/sec\ndata: 1024 kbps\nbit: 1152 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:658e614d56163dfca127ac0ce6add61f2ddd8a66","amp;dn":"Godzilla+Raids+Again+%281955%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"658e614d56163dfca127ac0ce6add61f2ddd8a66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,142,97,77,86,22,61,252,161,39,172,12,230,173,214,31,45,221,138,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
