But they've been sold a lie! Actually, they have been tricked into also making false bibles for someone else. Most don't know that Christian translators are being trapped into helping create a One-World Bible! And all the translation work is paid for by contributions from Bible believers like you. And Who is that &quot;someone,&quot; and what do they believe? They will tell you, in their own words!\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDavid Daniels, B.A., M.Div., is trained in Bible, theology and linguistics. After twenty years of searching the Hebrew and Greek scriptures and studying the history of the Bible, he concluded that the King James Bible is God's preserved words in English.
