The movie is (mostly) in Hebrew and is not available on DVD as far as I could tell. It is a VHS capture, hence the limited quality. I did my best to crop/enhance/color-correct the files. The movie itself came on 2 videocassettes (in PAL), so the upload contains two XVid files. I kept the commercials in the beginning for nostalgic value.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3a992652aeb9e2c8c03defe7fb12c3082367779","amp;dn":"Kvalim.VHS.Hebrew.1992","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3a992652aeb9e2c8c03defe7fb12c3082367779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,169,146,101,42,235,158,44,140,3,222,254,127,177,44,48,130,54,119,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
