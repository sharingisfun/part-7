This collection actually bests the previous version by including a few more excellent album tracks like &quot;Silence Is Golden,&quot; &quot;Marlena,&quot; and the group's excellent take on Maurice Williams &amp; the Zodiacs' &quot;Stay.&quot; Still, it's the hits most people are looking for and featured here are classics including &quot;Sherry,&quot; &quot;Big Girls Don't Cry&quot; and &quot;Dawn Go Away, &quot; as well as such Valli solo cuts as &quot;Can't Take My Eyes Off You&quot; and &quot;Grease.&quot; While there are adequate budget-oriented compilations available, listeners looking for a well-rounded anthology of the Four Seasons material needn't look any further than Definitive Pop.\n\n01 - Sherry\n02 - Big Girls Don't Cry\n03 - Walk Like A Man\n04 - Candy Girl\n05 - Marlena\n06 - Stay\n07 - Dawn (Go Away)\n08 - Silence Is Golden\n09 - Ronnie\n10 - Rag Doll\n11 - Save It For Me\n12 - Big Man In Town\n13 - Bye, Bye, Baby (Baby, Goodbye)\n14 - Girl Come Running\n15 - Don't Think Twice (It's All Right) Wonder Who\n16 - Let's Hang On (To What We've Got)\n17 - The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)\n18 - Working My Way Back To You\n19 - Opus 17 (Don't You Worry 'Bout Me)\n20 - I've Got You Under My Skin\n21 - Tell It To The Rain\n22 - Beggin'\n23 - Can't Take My Eyes Off You\n24 - C'mon Marianne\n25 - Will You Love Me Tomorrow\n26 - My Eyes Adored You\n27 - Swearin' To God\n28 - Who Loves You\n29 - December, 1963 (Oh, What A Night)\n30 - Grease\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9700501890c91dbe2fe338dc1087cc7e66298800","amp;dn":"Frankie+Valli+%26amp%3B+The+4+Seasons+-+The+Definitive+Pop+Collectio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9700501890c91dbe2fe338dc1087cc7e66298800","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,0,80,24,144,201,29,190,47,227,56,220,16,135,204,126,102,41,136,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
