The film stars Giorgio Albertazzi as an unnamed \n\nsophisticate attempting to convince a similarly nameless woman (Delphine Seyrig) that they met and were romantically \n\ninvolved a year ago in the same enormous, baroque European hotel. In the end, it hardly matters -- they're not characters \n\nso much as pawns anyway. Hypnotically dreamlike, Last Year at Marienbad is a surrealist parody of Hollywood melodrama, \n\na high-fashion romance with a dark, alien underbelly. According to screenwriter Alain Robbe-Grillet, the movie is a pure \n\nconstruction, without a frame of reference outside of its own existence -- the lives of its characters begin when the lights \n\ngo down, and conclude when they come back up.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : L'Annee derniere a Marienbad.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 29mn\n      Bit rate : 2177 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 6.72 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : English\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 29mn\n      Bit rate : 1981 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 304 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 2.35\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.301\n      StreamSize : 1.24 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 29mn\n      Bit rate : 191 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 123 MiB\n\nFrench audio, English, Spanish and Portuguese (Brazil) .srt subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c30f68672e3677e92391cc83f2ea1beedd8432c","amp;dn":"L_annee+derniere+a+Marienbad+-+Last+Year+at+Marienbad+-+Resnais","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c30f68672e3677e92391cc83f2ea1beedd8432c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,48,246,134,114,227,103,126,146,57,28,200,63,46,161,190,237,216,67,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
