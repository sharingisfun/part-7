Published through the efforts of writer Walker Percy (who also contributed a foreword) and Toole's mother, the book became first a cult classic, then a mainstream success; it earned Toole a posthumous Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1981, and is now considered a canonical work of modern literature of the Southern United States.[1]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59c2168e689f4e2ece46df79e25cf2e7c96c3c57","amp;dn":"119881___toole__john_kennedy_-_a_confederacy_of_dunces.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59c2168e689f4e2ece46df79e25cf2e7c96c3c57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,194,22,142,104,159,78,46,206,70,223,121,226,92,242,231,201,108,60,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
