It was released on March 25, 1983 and was the group&amp;#039;s first #1 on the UK Albums Chart. The album, produced by Chris Hughes and Ross Cullum, showcased synthesizer-based songs with lyrics reflecting Roland Orzabal&amp;#039;s bitter childhood and upbringing. The Hurting can be considered Tears for Fears&amp;#039; only true concept album, as references to emotional distress and primal therapy are found in nearly every song. The album itself was a big success and had a lengthy chart run (65 weeks) in the UK, where it reached no.1 - also reaching the Top 20 in several countries and yielded the international hit singles &quot;Mad World&quot; (top 5 hit in South Africa), &quot;Change&quot; (top 30 hit in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Italy and South Africa), and a re-recorded version of &quot;Pale Shelter&quot; (all of which were top 5 in the UK).\n\nThe album was remastered and reissued in 1999.
