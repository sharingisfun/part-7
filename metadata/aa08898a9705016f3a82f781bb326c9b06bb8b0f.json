It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineÃ¢â‚¬â€modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. Advanced users employ BlenderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s API for Python scripting to customize the application and write specialized tools; often these are included in BlenderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future releases. Blender is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process. Examples from many Blender-based projects are available in the showcase.\nBlender is cross-platform and runs equally well on Linux, Windows and Macintosh computers. Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent experience. To confirm specific compatibility, the list of supported platforms indicates those regularly tested by the development team.\n\nAs a community-driven project under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the public is empowered to make small and large changes to the code base, which leads to new features, responsive bug fixes, and better usability. Blender has no price tag, but you can invest, participate, and help to advance a powerful collaborative tool: Blender is your own 3D software.\n\n\n\nThe Blender Foundation and online developer community is proud to present Blender 2.71. Much awaited new features for Cycles renderer include deformation motion blur, fire/smoke and volume rendering and a baking API. User interface now allows for draggable popups and resizable preview widgets. Animation has new interpolation types with Ã¢â‚¬Å“easing equationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ presets. Modeling now allows to Ã¢â‚¬Å“split normalsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Sculpting/Painting has new HSL color wheel and constant detail in dyntopo. Game development now allows deactivating logic bricks, multi-threaded animations, cast only materials and Ã¢â‚¬Å“unlimitedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ action layers. Freestyle NPR rendering has a new textured strokes feature, along with line sorting options.\n\n\nThis file is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8.\nReleased 26 June 2014.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa08898a9705016f3a82f781bb326c9b06bb8b0f","amp;dn":"Blender+2.71+-+Windows+-+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa08898a9705016f3a82f781bb326c9b06bb8b0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,8,137,138,151,5,1,111,58,130,247,129,187,50,108,155,6,187,139,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
