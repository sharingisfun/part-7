It includes a number of features, including a built in protection monitor that blocks malicious processes before they even start. Malwarebytes Anti-Malware monitors every process and stops malicious processes before they even start. The Realtime Protection Module uses our advanced heuristic scanning technology which monitors your system to keep it safe and secure. In addition, we have implemented a threats center which will allow you to keep up to date with the latest malware threats.\n\nWhat's new\n\nIssues Fixed:\nÃ‚Â· Fixed crash during Heuristic Analysis phase when scanning\nÃ‚Â· Fixed SDK database load errors by making a change to temporarily ignore the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Check for updates before scanningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ setting for Scheduled Scans\nÃ‚Â· Fixed crash when editing or removing an Access Policy if the name and description fields in the policy were different\nÃ‚Â· Fixed issue where the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Restart computer when required for threat removalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ setting did not appear correctly on Add or Edit Schedule dialogs\nÃ‚Â· Updated end user license agreement\n\nKnown Issues:\nÃ‚Â· The fix for the SDK database load error issue referenced above is not a permanent fix, but rather a work-around as we continue to investigated these errors. As soon as we have a more permanent solution we plan to roll back the work-around and again honor the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Check for updates before scanningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ setting. We should hopefully have this ready for our next release, which will be coming soon.\nÃ‚Â· If you continue to see these errors after installing 2.1.6, then please reduce the overall number of scheduled scans and updates you have set up. If you stick with the default daily Threat Scan and one scheduled Update Check every couple hours, then you should be fine.\n\nHome Page www.malwarebytes.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c21f516c3920b298b398f73c08b850ca7273a0d2","amp;dn":"Malwarebytes+Anti-Malware+Premium+2.1.6.1022","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c21f516c3920b298b398f73c08b850ca7273a0d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,31,81,108,57,32,178,152,179,152,247,60,8,184,80,202,114,115,160,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
