It's where we come\nfrom. It's called KONA TOWN...The number one exporter\nof the Stone Love Sound. We licked it back, and look\nwhat we found: alive, all Live and thriving in our home\nstomping ground...Grown here, not flown here...\nBefore we came In With The Old...\nWe harvested this...sssmokin...\nKONA GOLD\n\nWhen we are far from The Islands, they are never far\nfrom us. This is an arsenal of favorites from the back of\nthe bus...delivered live and direct 2,000 miles away\nfrom The Rock we grew up on to the Boulder where we\nstay. After a decade of touring, after ten years on the\nroad, we still take Hawaii Nei with us wherever we go.\nPan-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic...\nthere's still no place like home!\nSo we packed you this fatty...\nEnjoy KONA GOLD\n\nLive album by rock-reggae band Pepper.\nAll files MP3 @ 320kbps.
