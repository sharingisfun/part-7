But when she splits up with her boyfriend Arthur, she is heartbroken and only MaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«l seems to understand her. The only problem is MaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«l is Arthur's best friend. In a world of IPods and MSN, Lol and her friends are feeling their way through tenth grade, speaking a language peppered with text message shortcuts and dodging their often divorced and largely overwhelmed parents. After an affair with her ex-husband, LolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mum Anne, is being courted by a police detective. When she &quot;accidentally&quot; reads her teenage daughter's journal, she realises just how wide the communication gap has become. But Lol and AnneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s differences are resolved as they join forces to save MaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«l's musical dream. \n\n\n\nTHIS TORRENT HAS SUBTITLES IN ENGLISH, SPANISH AND BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE.\n\n\nThanks to those helping me seed.
