Things really got moving, though, when DeWilde was replaced by sultry singer Mariska Veres, whose sexy presence and solid singing brought the band a second Netherlands hit, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Send Me a Postcard,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and then a huge international smash with Ã¢â‚¬Å“VenusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 1970 after the group had signed to Jerry Ross' Colossus Records imprint. Although Shocking Blue's albums (1968Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Shocking Blue, 1969Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s At Home, 1970Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s ScorpioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dance, 1971Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s 3rd Album, 1972Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Inkpot, 1972Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Attila, 1973Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Dream on Dreamer, and 1974Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Good Times) featured progressive rock elements and inventive arrangements thanks to VanLeeuwen's writing and production skills, the band was essentially marketed as a pop singles unit, and while they scored several subsequent hits in their homeland, none of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s releases approached the massive saturation success of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Venus.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Veres left Shocking Blue in 1974 to pursue a solo career, and while there have been various reunions and different touring incarnations of the band over the years (including a version fronted by Veres in the '90s), its creative history ended then. VanLeeuwen later re-surfaced in the folk/jazz group Galaxy-Lin, while his most famous composition, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Venus,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ continued to see play on oldies stations. Veres died of cancer in 2006 at the age of 59.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Venus\n02.Mighty Joe\n03.Send Me A Postcard\n04.Long And Lonesome Road\n05.Never Marry A Railroad Man\n06.Ink Pot\n07.Rock In The Sea\n08.California Here I Come\n09.Dream On Dreamer\n10.Hello Darkness\n11.Shocking You\n12.I'm A Woman\n13.Deamon Lover\n14.Sally Was A Good Old Girl\n15.Blossom Lady\n16.Out Of Sight Out Of Mind\n17.Eve And The Apple\n18.I'll Write Your Name Through The Fire\n19.Let Me Carry Your Bag\n20.Oh Lord\n21.This America\n22.Good Times\n23.Gonna Sing Me A Song\n24.Love Is In The Air\n25.Lucy Brown Is Back In Town\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Roll Engine Roll\n02.I Boll Weevil\n03.Pickin' Tomatoes\n04.Waterloo\n05.Harley Davidson\n06.Love Machine\n07.Fireball Of Love\n08.Hot Sand\n09.Wild Wind\n10.Keep It If You Want It\n11.Give My Love To The Sunshine\n12.Love Buzz\n13.I Saw You In June\n14.Is This A Dream\n15.I Like You\n16.Broken Heart\n17.When I Was A Girl\n18.In My Time Of Dying\n19.Everything That's Mine\n20.Where The Picknick Was\n21.I Won't Be Lonely Long\n22.Come My Way\n23.What You Gonna Do\n24.Get It On\n25.Fix Your Hair Darling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
