In the Australian outback, a kangaroo's hop is key to finding water in a desert of over a million square kilometres. On an English farm, an insect's ultimate ejector seat accelerates it to 700G with help from a clutch in its crotch. And high above the jungles of Borneo, a leaping snake's unique shape allows it to glide, even without wings.\r\n\r\n2)  Masters of the Sky \r\nThis episode looks at powered flight, revealing why peregrine falcons can top 200 miles an hour, how a hummingbird is a slave to its own rather manic lifestyle and that the albatross's secret to flying for free is its nose. Heavyweight beetles break the rules to find love, a devious sparrow-hawk uses agility to execute a lightning-fast raid on his prey and half a million mother bats dominate the sky above, and below, the ground with a dazzling display of aerial prowess.\r\n\r\n3)  Crowded Skies \r\nThis episode features a creature that creates sound out of thin air with the world's fastest courtship display and arguably the world's most aggressive bird. In a South American jungle, there's 'hunt and evasion' flying during the night, as bats and moths fight for the upper hand in one of the world's oldest arms races. Plus a camera films a giant flock to unlock the secrets that keep half a million birds from colliding in the same air space.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fd/Life-in-the-Air-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/27/Life-in-the-Air-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/Life-in-the-Air-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/Life-in-the-Air-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/Life-in-the-Air-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c1/Life-in-the-Air-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8a/Life-in-the-Air-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bc/Life-in-the-Air-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9e/Life-in-the-Air-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/45/Life-in-the-Air-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/Life-in-the-Air-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/28/Life-in-the-Air-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b3/Life-in-the-Air-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5b/Life-in-the-Air-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/46/Life-in-the-Air-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Life-in-the-Air-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3023 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 58mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.28 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b076ywc6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52b02d4c9e06dc6ee1a3798eda6a24d1053b310f","amp;dn":"BBC+Life+In+The+Air+Series+1+3of3+Crowded+Skies+720p+x264+AAC+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52b02d4c9e06dc6ee1a3798eda6a24d1053b310f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,176,45,76,158,6,220,110,225,163,121,142,218,106,36,209,5,59,49,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
