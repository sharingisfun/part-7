Its 39 half-hour episodes were originally screened on ITV in the UK and in syndication in the USA. The scriptwriters included Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, Alan Fennell, and Dennis Spooner. Barry Gray composed the music, and Derek Meddings was the special effects director.\n\nStingray was the first Supermarionation show to be filmed in colour, and also the first in which marionettes had interchangeable heads with different facial expressions. It was also the first British television programme to be filmed entirely in colour.\n\nStingray, a highly sophisticated combat submarine built for speed and manoeuvrability, is the flagship of the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP), a 21st Century security organisation based at Marineville in the year 2065. She is capable of speeds of up to 600 knots and advanced pressure compensators allow her to submerge to depths of over 36,000 feet, which permits cruising to the bottom of any part of any ocean in the world.\n\nMarineville is located somewhere on the California coast of the United States. In the event of attack, the entire base can descend on hydraulic jacks into underground bunkers. Marineville is 10 miles inland, and Stingray is launched from the base's &quot;Pen 3&quot; through a tunnel leading to the Pacific Ocean.\n\n&quot;Action Stations,&quot; &quot;Launch Stations,&quot; and &quot;Battle Stations&quot; are sounded not by sirens but by a rapid drum-beat, composed and recorded by series composer Barry Gray, played over the Marineville public address system.\n\nThe pilot of Stingray is the square-jawed Captain Troy Tempest, the Supermarionation puppet who was accidentally modelled on James Garner, accompanied by Dixie navigator Lieutenant George Lee &quot;Phones&quot; Sheridan, nicknamed &quot;Phones&quot; because of his job as Stingray's hydrophone operator. His real name, George Sheridan, is referred to in the show's publicity material, but is never mentioned on-screen. \nTroy and Phones board Stingray by sitting down in their side-by-side command chairs in the stand-by lounge, which are lowered rapidly into the submarine on long tubular poles called injector tubes. An additional seat and pole is situated just behind theirs, for use by a third crew member, usually Marina, or a passenger. \nThey take their orders from the crusty, &quot;hoverchair&quot;-bound Commander Samuel Shore, whose daughter, Lieutenant Atlanta Shore, is also a WASP operative and is enamoured of Troy. Sub-Lieutenant John Fisher also regularly takes shifts at Marineville Control. The reason Shore is confined to a hoverchair is revealed in the episode The Ghost of the Sea. As a security agent for a deep sea mining platform, he was attacked by a submarine. He managed to ram his attacker in return, and then escape to the surface with scuba gear, but in so doing, he lost the use of his legs. \nAll this took place five years before the time in which Stingray is set.\n\nDuring the course of the series, Stingray encounters a number of underwater races, both hostile and otherwise. The &quot;aquaphibians,&quot; a submarine warrior race, appear frequently, often under the command of King Titan, whose puppet was accidentally modelled on Laurence Olivier, and who is the ruler of the underwater city of Titanica.\n \n\n\nVideo: 720x536 xVid 29.97fps\nAudio: 48K 224Kbps AC3 2-channel stereo (L/R)\n\nEnjoy!\n\nComments welcome.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e8630b00a6cf2e26948a84e022d5ece755e8b65","amp;dn":"Stingray+TV+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e8630b00a6cf2e26948a84e022d5ece755e8b65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,134,48,176,10,108,242,226,105,72,168,78,2,45,94,206,117,94,139,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
