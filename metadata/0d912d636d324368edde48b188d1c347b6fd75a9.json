Plunge into a world of knights and ladies, popes and emperors, lords and vassals, and other important players on the medieval stage including Francis of Assisi and Frederick II.\n\nFinally, to complete your grasp of this historical period, you look at the years between 1300 and 1500Ã¢â‚¬â€during which the seeds of modernity were planted.
