It was first released in August 2001, and is the most popular version of Windows, based on installed user base. The name &quot;XP&quot; is short for &quot;eXPerience.&quot;\nWindows XP was the successor to both Windows 2000 and Windows Me, and was the first consumer-oriented operating system produced by Microsoft to be built on the Windows NT kernel and architecture. Windows XP was released for retail sale on October 25, 2001, and over 400 million copies were in use in January 2006, according to an estimate in that month by an IDC analyst. It was succeeded by Windows Vista, which was released to volume license customers on November 8, 2006, and worldwide to the general public on January 30, 2007. Direct OEM and retail sales of Windows XP ceased on June 30, 2008. Microsoft continued to sell Windows XP through their System Builders (smaller OEMs who sell assembled computers) program until January 31, 2009. XP may continue to be available as these sources run through their inventory or by purchasing Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Pro, Windows Vista Ultimate or Windows Vista Business, and then downgrading to Windows XP.\n\nThe most common editions of the operating system were Windows XP Home Edition, which was targeted at home users, and Windows XP Professional, which offered additional features such as support for Windows Server domains and two physical processors, and was targeted at power users, business and enterprise clients. Windows XP Media Center Edition has additional multimedia features enhancing the ability to record and watch TV shows, view DVD movies, and listen to music. Windows XP Tablet PC Edition was designed to run stylus applications built using the Tablet PC platform.\n\nWindows XP was eventually released for two additional architectures, Windows XP 64-bit Edition for IA-64 (Itanium) processors and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition for x86-64. There is also Windows XP Embedded, a component version of the Windows XP Professional, and editions for specific markets such as Windows XP Starter Edition. By mid 2009, a manufacturer revealed the first Windows XP powered cellular telephone.\n\nThe NT-based versions of Windows, which are programmed in C, C++, and assembly, are known for their improved stability and efficiency over the 9x versions of Microsoft Windows. Windows XP presented a significantly redesigned graphical user interface, a change Microsoft promoted as more user-friendly than previous versions of Windows. A new software management facility called Side-by-Side Assembly was introduced to ameliorate the &quot;DLL hell&quot; that plagues 9x versions of Windows. It is also the first version of Windows to use product activation to combat illegal copying. Windows XP had also been criticized by some users for security vulnerabilities, tight integration of applications such as Internet Explorer 6 and Windows Media Player, and for aspects of its default user interface. Later versions with Service Pack 2, Service Pack 3, and Internet Explorer 8 addressed some of these concerns.\n\nEditions\n\nThe two major editions are Windows XP Home Edition, designed for home users, and Windows XP Professional, designed for business and power-users. XP Professional contains advanced features that the average home user would not use. However, these features are not necessarily missing from XP Home. They are simply disabled, but are there and can become functional. These releases were made available at retail outlets that sell computer software, and were preinstalled on computers sold by major computer manufacturers. As of mid-2008, both editions continue to be sold. A third edition, called Windows XP Media Center Edition was introduced in 2002 and was updated every year until 2006 to incorporate new digital media, broadcast television and Media Center Extender capabilities. Unlike the Home and Professional edition, it was never made available for retail purchase, and was typically either sold through OEM channels, or was preinstalled on computers that were typically marketed as &quot;media center PCs&quot;.\n\nTwo different 64-bit editions were made available, one designed specifically for Itanium-based workstations, which was introduced in 2001 around the same time as the Home and Professional editions, but was discontinued a few years later when vendors of Itanium hardware stopped selling workstation-class machines due to low sales. The other, called Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, supports the x86-64 extension. x86-64 was implemented first by AMD as &quot;AMD64&quot;, found in AMD's Opteron and Athlon 64 chips, and later implemented by Intel as &quot;Intel 64&quot; (formerly known as IA-32e and EM64T), found in Intel's Pentium 4 and later chips.\n\nWindows XP Tablet PC Edition was produced for a class of specially designed notebook/laptop computers called tablet PCs. It is compatible with a pen-sensitive screen, supporting handwritten notes and portrait-oriented screens.\n\nMicrosoft also released Windows XP Embedded, an edition for specific consumer electronics, set-top boxes, kiosks/ATMs, medical devices, arcade video games, point-of-sale terminals, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) components. In July 2006, Microsoft released Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs, a thin client version of Windows XP Embedded which targets older machines (as early as the original Pentium). It is only available to Software Assurance customers. It is intended for corporate customers who would like to upgrade to Windows XP to take advantage of its security and management capabilities, but can't afford to purchase new hardware.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMinimum Hardware Requirements\n\n\nProcessor: 233 MHz\n\nMemory: 64 MB RAM\n\nHard Drive Free Space: 4.2 GB\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPhysical Memory (RAM) Limits In 32-bit Windows\n\n\nWindows XP Professional: 4 GB\n\nWindows XP Home Edition: 4 GB\n\nWindows XP Media Center Edition: 4 GB\n\nWindows XP Tablet PC Edition: 4 GB\n\nWindows XP Starter Edition: 512 MB\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPhysical Memory (RAM) Limit In 64-bit Windows\n\n\nWindows XP Professional: 128 GB\n\nWindows XP Home Edition: N/A\n\nWindows XP Media Center Edition: N/A\n\nWindows XP Tablet PC Edition: N/A\n\nWindows XP Starter Edition: N/A\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99310ff0188935a48ddc47b1964921a2f3fcc5f0","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+Professional+SP3+%2832+Bit%29+x86+%28December+2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99310ff0188935a48ddc47b1964921a2f3fcc5f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,49,15,240,24,137,53,164,141,220,71,177,150,73,33,162,243,252,197,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
