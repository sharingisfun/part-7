Check it out :)\nBuy it if you like it!\n\n\n\n\nBeastmilk have created an irradiated gem, forged in the fires of a dying world.\n\nClimax is an off-kilter masterpiece, a true homage to the futility of human strugglings; we do all die anyway. But in the end one is left with a sliver of hope. In the forlorn but resolute words of the singer Kvohst: &quot;Holding on to love in a cold world/I'm holding on to love/Crying out in a dead universe/I'm holding on to love&quot;.\n\n- http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/60001/Beastmilk-Climax/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c97a36c82ad2bfb327cff39f12ed46b732642b1","amp;dn":"Beastmilk+-+Climax+%282013%29+%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c97a36c82ad2bfb327cff39f12ed46b732642b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,151,163,108,130,173,43,251,50,124,255,57,241,46,212,107,115,38,66,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
