It is for both professional traders and undergraduates studying the basics of finance. Assuming no prior knowledge of probability, Sheldon M. Ross offers clear, simple explanations of arbitrage, the Black-Scholes option pricing formula, and other topics such as utility functions, optimal portfolio selections, and the capital assets pricing model. Among the many new features of this third edition are new chapters on Brownian motion and geometric Brownian motion, stochastic order relations, and stochastic dynamic programming, along with expanded sets of exercises and references for all the chapters.\n\n-This book combines accuracy and easy to understand mathematical arguments\n-Assumes almost no technical knowledge, but presents all needed preliminary material\n-The third edition is completely revised with two new chapters of material and additional exercises\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Probability\n2. Normal random variables\n3. Geometric Brownian motion\n4. Interest rates and present value analysis\n5. Pricing contracts via arbitrage\n6. The Arbitrage Theorem\n7. The BlackÃ¢â‚¬â€œScholes formula\n8. Additional results on options\n9. Valuing by expected utility\n10. Stochastic order relations\n11. Optimization models\n12. Stochastic dynamic programming\n13. Exotic options\n14. Beyond geometric motion models\n15. Autoregressive models and mean reversion.\n\n\nAuthor\n\nSheldon M. Ross, University of Southern California\nSheldon M. Ross is the Epstein Chair Professor at the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Southern California. He received his Ph.D. in statistics at Stanford University in 1968 and was formerly a Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1976 until 2004. He has published more than 100 articles and a variety of textbooks in the areas of statistics and applied probability, including Topics in Finite and Discrete Mathematics (2000), Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists, Fourth Edition (2009), A First Course in Probability, Eighth Edition (2009), and Introduction to Probability Models, Tenth Edition (2009), among others.
