If freed, he may train as a Viking warrior, and come to know the glories of true brotherhood and the horrors of unspeakable evil. In the world of Vikings, a warrior's destiny is forged in the heat of battle. If the fates decree it, Hafdan may emerge as a new hero . . . a new myth . . . and perhaps a new legend.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:830ce0306052c29014c3e32d8642c5b106f2b0f2","amp;dn":"Viking+Warrior+-+%5BThe+Strongbow+Saga%2C+%231%5D+-+Judson+Roberts.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"830ce0306052c29014c3e32d8642c5b106f2b0f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,12,224,48,96,82,194,144,20,195,227,45,134,66,197,177,6,242,176,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
