He participated in meetings with top-level military and civilian players, where strategy was made and managed. At the same time, he regularly carried a rifle alongside rank-and-file soldiers in combat actions, unusual for a general. Now, as a witness to all levels of military command, Bolger offers a unique assessment of these wars, from 9/11 to the final withdrawal from the region. Writing with hard-won experience and unflinching honesty, Bolger makes the firm case that in Iraq and in Afghanistan, we lost Ã¢â‚¬â€ but we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to. Intelligence was garbled. Key decision makers were blinded by spreadsheets or theories. And, at the root of our failure, we never really understood our enemy. Why We Lost is a timely, forceful, and compulsively readable account of these wars from a fresh and authoritative perspective","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f7f53a7a6844f5c30bbc0d5cb627222b3d167fa","amp;dn":"Why+We+Lost%3A+the+Iraq+and+Afghanistan+Wars+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f7f53a7a6844f5c30bbc0d5cb627222b3d167fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,127,83,167,166,132,79,92,48,187,192,213,203,98,114,34,179,209,103,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
