You will need VLC Player to listen to it (or Winamp I am told).\n\nDo burn to a CD you can use CDRTFE which is free, very lightweight and you can download here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdrtfe.sourceforge.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdrtfe.sourceforge.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe two MP3s added in this download is an extended version of Mystic Ruins, and the other is a track that for whateber reason isn't even on this album. That one is titled Nights into Dreams.\n\nEnjoy everybody! I will seed at least 250% and as long as I still have this computer I should be able to reseed upon request via pm. DO NOT PM ME IF THERE IS STILL A SEEDER, only if there are no seeders.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a14760f767f85f7da5cb6708d9a7df8a93fa0eb","amp;dn":"Sonic+Adventure+OST+Soundtrack+FLAC+LOSSLESS%21+VERY+VERY+RARE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a14760f767f85f7da5cb6708d9a7df8a93fa0eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,20,118,15,118,127,133,247,218,92,182,112,141,154,125,248,169,63,160,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
