Sex fiends! Gangsters! Mad scientists! Tentacles! Yes, this MEGAPACK has them all, no less than 25 lurid tales ripped from the pages of pulp fiction magazines. For The Pulp Fiction Megapack, we selected stories with great pulp titles. (Where else are you going to find stories like &quot;Blood for the Vampire Dead,&quot; &quot;Mistress of Snarling Death,&quot; or &quot;When Super-Apes Plot&quot;?) Of course, these stories were all written in a different time, with different standards of what was acceptable. They are decidedly NOT politically correct by modern standards. Please go into them aware of this fact, and if you are offended by racism, stereotypes, bad writing, sadism, or anything else prevalent in cheap literature of the early 20th century...well, this may not be the right ebook for you. But if you can sit back and enjoy these stories for what they areÃ¢â‚¬â€simple titlations from another eraÃ¢â‚¬â€you may find some surprising treats.\n\nGruesome &amp; grisly, shudder-filled &amp; TERRIFIC!!! \nJanuary 31, 2013\nBy Librarian TOP 1000 REVIEWER\n\nThis is one terrific Megapack. It's exactly as the publisher describes it, so there should be no unpleasant surprises (though it does contain many PLEASANT ones). Everyone knows in advance not to expect it to contain so-called &quot;great&quot; works of literature, nor should anyone take umbrage at the level of political incorrectness; you were forewarned.\n\nWhat IS surprising, however, is just how well-written many of these lurid works actually are. These guys sure knew how to tell a story! Despite being paid-by-the-word in a profession where quantity often trumped quality, many pulp authors proved to be talented and creative wordsmiths who were particularly adept at masterfully manipulating the English language to create thrilling tales--all the while tallying and, whenever possible, increasing their word count to boost their profits (which is why colorful, descriptive adjectives abound). Such padding could easily yield inferior results (and very often did), but in the hands of a skillful writer, a truly fanciful, entertaining and well-constructed story could still emerge--as many of the authors in this delectable collection of grisly tales so vividly demonstrate.\n\nNamed for the inexpensive, low-grade, wood-pulp paper on which they were printed in the magazines that originally published them, these 25 pulp pieces are particularly remarkable inasmuch as the compilers of this collection deliberately sought tales with outrageously provocative titles. A great title, of course, is no guarantee the story to which it is attached will be equally as good (and oftentimes a powerful title was deliberately created to disguise an otherwise weak tale), but in the case of this Megapack, most of the stories really ARE equal to their titillating titles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed3d8691812042b7e2e10a20c34cb484e853ea02","amp;dn":"The+Pulp+Fiction+Megapack+-+Various+Authors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed3d8691812042b7e2e10a20c34cb484e853ea02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,61,134,145,129,32,66,183,226,225,10,32,195,76,180,132,232,83,234,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
