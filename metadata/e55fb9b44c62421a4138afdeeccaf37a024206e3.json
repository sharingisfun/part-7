It's no wonder AC-DC was one of the first bands to get this new technology. Only the best of the best emerged in 1981.\n\nThis rip is a perfect reproduction of the 1980 release Back in Black. It is amazing the CD ripped with no errors being nearly 35 years old. For you purists, this is what you need.\n\nBig Papi's favorite AC-DC song in high school (1981) was Back in Black, but these days I have to go with Who Made Who, probably because the movie Maximum Overdrive was a killer flick. \n\n- Big Papi\n\nimage\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAC/DC - Back in Black (ATCO 92418)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: AC/DC\nAlbum................: Back in Black (ATCO 92418)\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1980\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 71 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
