Based in traditional string band music, Western swing also incorporated traditional pop melodies, jazz improvisation, blues, and folk, creating a wildly entertaining and eclectic form of American music. Bob Wills and Milton Brown popularized the genre in the '30s, and Wills became known as the father of the genre, since he remained popular for several decades, during which he had a remarkable string of hit singles. Although it sometimes faded away from view, Western swing remained popular throughout the 20th century, occasionally experiencing upswings in popularity, such as in the early '70s and the early '90s.~allmusic\n\nKrazy Kat Records: This is the label that really turned me on to the greatness of Interstate Music. In the '80s, the Krazy Kat imprint highlighted blues, jump-blues and jazz artists. As a CD series in the '90s, it's now dedicated mainly to obscure country and western swing artists... and is uniformly stunning. I have yet to find one of these discs which was not very, very good. The title pretty much says it all... This is not music you're likely to find at the local WalMart anytime soon. Fab old stuff, recorded on microscopic labels with names like RichTone, Tex-Talent, Delta, and Swing... A few tracks are a bit fuzzy, but most have great sound quality! Again, highly recommended!''~slipcue.com\n\n01. The Texas Tophands - 12th Street Rag\n02. Wayne Johnston &amp; His Bluebonnet Playboys - Sweet Lucy\n03.
