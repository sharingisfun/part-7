A decade ago, the deadly illness swept through her nation. Most of the infected perished, while many of the children who survived were left with strange markings. AdelinaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s black hair turned silver, her lashes went pale, and now she has only a jagged scar where her left eye once was. Her cruel father believes she is a malfetto, an abomination, ruining their familyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s good name and standing in the way of their fortune. But some of the feverÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s survivors are rumored to possess more than just scars they are believed to have mysterious and powerful gifts, and though their identities remain secret, they have come to be called the Young Elites.\n\nTeren Santoro works for the king. As Leader of the Inquisition Axis, it is his job to seek out the Young Elites, to destroy them before they destroy the nation. He believes the Young Elites to be dangerous and vengeful, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Teren who may possess the darkest secret of all.\n\nEnzo Valenciano is a member of the Dagger Society. This secret sect of Young Elites seeks out others like them before the Inquisition Axis can. But when the Daggers find Adelina, they discover someone with powers like theyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never seen.\nAdelina wants to believe Enzo is on her side, and that Teren is the true enemy. But the lives of these three will collide in unexpected ways, as each fights a very different and personal battle. But of one thing they are all certain: Adelina has abilities that shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t belong in this world. A vengeful blackness in her heart. And a desire to destroy all who dare to cross her.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f669548bec079cedb8a2334de49235ebeefeb454","amp;dn":"The+Young+Elites","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f669548bec079cedb8a2334de49235ebeefeb454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,105,84,139,236,7,156,237,184,162,51,77,228,146,53,235,238,254,180,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
