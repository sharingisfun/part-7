IF ANYONE CAN FIND THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE UNLABELED ONES, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO POST IN COMMENTS. I TRIED EVERY PROGRAM I KNEW OF TO RECOGNIZE THE FILES, AND THEY COULDNT.\nFEEL FREE TO SHARE THESE FILES IF YOU LIKE.\n\nthis torrent has a variety of different sleep sounds, sleep music that I have narrowed down to be the best, in my opinion of all the sleep cd's i've listened to.\nI have about 35 dvds worth of sleep files. I loaded them onto my computer player, and listened to them all, then narrowed them down simply by deleting the ones that i didn't think were superior.\ni think you will find a great variety and if you burn all these to a dvd, i think you will have plenty to change up from for a long time.\nmy most favorite is the rain one called Ruth Ann Goode, PhD - Heavy Rain and Thunder  if i had to choose one to listen to for life it is this one","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69fa18a4ee9b8de1722f51363475c46c3c42ef39","amp;dn":"Nature+sounds%2C+Sleep+sounds%2C+relaxation%2C++to+make+you+sleepy+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69fa18a4ee9b8de1722f51363475c46c3c42ef39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,250,24,164,238,155,141,225,114,47,81,54,52,117,196,108,60,66,239,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
