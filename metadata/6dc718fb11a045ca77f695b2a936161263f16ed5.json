We love them for their big eyes or furry faces but we also fall for the sounds they make and the way they move - who doesn't love a waddling penguin? These animals have become online celebrities, with millions of us finding and sharing videos every day - a tiny snoring hummingbird or a sneezing panda is just too cute not to share.\n\nGordon Buchanan has dedicated his life to filming wildlife. He wants to understand why we have such a strong emotional response to these particular species. Why a baby panda makes us go all gooey or why a squeaking frog got over 11 million internet hits. Travelling to meet these super cute animals, he reveals the surprising science behind each of the animals we love so much, starting with one of the most iconic animals on the planet, the giant panda. The panda's beautiful markings set it apart, but it's that big round oversized head that makes it so unusual. Although we find the teddy bear look incredibly appealing, for the panda, the size of its head tells the story of millions of years of evolution and survival.\n\nGordon also meets the fennec fox, with big ears that look sweet but are actually crucial to the fennec's survival out in the Sahara. He travels to Kenya to meet young elephants learning how to perfect their trunk skills and discovers the surprising secret behind a penguin's comic waddle. He hangs out with Eli, a five-year-old chimpanzee whose giggle can give us new information about our own evolution, and discovers just why snoring can help a tiny hummingbird conserve enough energy to make it through the night.\n\n   \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b053d3b0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b053d3b0&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n\n\nSuper Cute Animals - (1x60 Minutes)\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Super Cute Animals.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 700 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 58mn 4s\nTotal bitrate               : 1 685 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 58mn 4s\nBitrate                     : 1 486 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.198\nStream size                 : 617 MB (88%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 58mn 4s\nBitrate mode                : Constant\nBitrate                     : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 79.8 MB (11%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave preload          : 504 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 18.6 -b 192","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dc718fb11a045ca77f695b2a936161263f16ed5","amp;dn":"Super+Cute+Animals+-+Documentary+-+Wildlife+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dc718fb11a045ca77f695b2a936161263f16ed5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,199,24,251,17,160,69,202,119,246,149,178,169,54,22,18,99,241,110,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
