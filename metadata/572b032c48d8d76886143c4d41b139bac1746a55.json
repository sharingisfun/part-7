They work on computers, Xbox 360, PS3, WDHD TV, media servers, some blu ray players and some upscaling dvd players.==-\n\n* We believe it is better to test quality with a sample, which we always provide. It's a much better representation of what the release will look like on your TV / monitor.\n\n* Subtitles are provided as often as possible but sometimes the source doesn't include them. If you desperately want subs, there are plenty of places they can be found. Just ensure the run time is the same. \n\n* The occasional cinavia error on the PS3 does not occur on all PS3's. If it happens to you, don't claim it will happen to everyone. \n\n* If you have problems extracting files, check your files thoroughly before making any comments claiming it's a bad download. We test our files properly before sharing them with you. \n\n* Yes, our releases ARE 720p. We just don't waste space by encoding the black bars. If you don't understand this, do research on aspect ratio. The source files are the same or proportionate resolution. \n\n* Comments are meant to thank the encoder and discuss the encode, not for unintelligently bashing the movie itself. If you can't say anything useful, move on. Films should be judged on what they are intended to do, not what you want them to do for you. \n\n* To those smart enough to know all of this already, we salute you!\n\n================================================================\n\nSource: The.Birds.1963.720p.HDTV.DD5.1.x264-NaRB\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 3007M\nPlayTime           : 01:59:28.592\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 1280 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 712 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 23.975fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 115270\nVideoBitRate       : 2866814\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : AC3\nAudioBitRate       : 640000\nAudioChannels      : 6\nAudioSampleRate    : 48000 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056869/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056869/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA wealthy San Francisco playgirl pursues a potential boyfriend\nto a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for\nthe bizarre when birds of all kinds suddenly begin to attack\npeople there in increasing numbers and with increasing viciousness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:572b032c48d8d76886143c4d41b139bac1746a55","amp;dn":"The+Birds+1963+HDTV+XvidHD+720p-NPW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"572b032c48d8d76886143c4d41b139bac1746a55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,43,3,44,72,216,215,104,134,20,60,77,65,177,57,186,193,116,106,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
