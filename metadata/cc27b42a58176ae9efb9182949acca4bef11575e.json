It was first shown in 1955 from January 24 to May 8 at the New York MOMA. Steichens international collection of images, included his focused tour of 11 European countries including France, Switzerland, Austria and Germany.\n\nThe exhibit was turned into a book of the same name, containing all 503 images from the exhibition and an introduction by Carl Sandburg, the 1951 recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry and Steichens brother-in-law. Sandburg states in the prologue of the exhibition: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The first cry of a baby in Chicago, or Zamboango, in Amsterdam or Rangoon, has the same pitch and key, each saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am! I have come through! I belong! I am a member of the Family. Many the babies and grownup here from photographs made in sixty-eight nations round our planet Earth. You travel and see what the camera saw. The wonder of human mind, heart wit and instinct is here. You might catch yourself saying, Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not a stranger here.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe book was reproduced in a variety of formats (most popularly a pocket-sized volume) in the 1950s, and reprinted in large format for its 40th anniversary. The book version of the exhibit has sold more than four million copies.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_of_Man&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_of_Man&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc27b42a58176ae9efb9182949acca4bef11575e","amp;dn":"The+Family+of+Man+-+The+Greatest+Photographic+Exhibition+of+all+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc27b42a58176ae9efb9182949acca4bef11575e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,39,180,42,88,23,106,233,239,185,24,41,73,172,202,75,239,17,87,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
