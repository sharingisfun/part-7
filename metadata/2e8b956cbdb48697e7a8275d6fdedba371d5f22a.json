Yet in all the ongoing debates about creationism and its descendant, intelligent design, one element of the controversy is rarely mentioned: the evidence, the empirical truth of evolution by natural selection. And that evidence is vast, varied, and magnificent, drawn from a huge spectrum of scientific inquiry ranging from genetics, anatomy, and molecular biology to paleontology and geology.\n\nWhy Evolution Is True is a succinct and accessible summary of the facts supporting Darwinian evolution. Scientists today are finding species splitting in two, observing natural selection changing animals and plants before our eyes, and discovering more and more fossils capturing change in the pastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½dinosaurs that have sprouted feathers, fish that have grown limbs. Jerry Coyne eloquently shows that evolution does not destroy the beauty of life but enhances it.\n\nReading this book will explain why so many scientists have dedicated their careers to resolving this debate, and why education administrators fervently fight legislation demanding that science curricula include equal time for anti-Darwinian theories. By demonstrating the indelible stamp of the processes first proposed by Darwin, Jerry Coyne clearly confirms that evolution is more than just a theory: it is a factÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a fact that cannot be doubted by anyone with an open mind. Among the wonders that science has uncovered about the universe, no subject has sparked more fascination and fury than evolution. Yet in all the ongoing debates about creationism and its descendant, intelligent design, one element of the controversy is rarely mentioned: the evidence, the empirical truth of evolution by natural selection. And that evidence is vast, varied, and magnificent, drawn from a huge spectrum of scientific inquiry ranging from genetics, anatomy, and molecular biology to paleontology and geology.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJerry A. Coyne, Ph.D is a Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago and a member of both the Committee on Genetics and the Committee on Evolutionary Biology. Coyne received a B.S. in Biology from the College of William and Mary. He then earned a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology at Harvard University in 1978, working in the laboratory of Richard Lewontin. After a postdoctoral fellowship in Timothy Prouts laboratory at The University of California at Davis, he took his first academic position as assistant professor in the Department of Zoology at The University of Maryland. In 1996 he joined the faculty of The University of Chicago.\n\nCoynes work is focused on understanding the origin of species: the evolutionary process that produces discrete groups in nature. To do this, he uses a variety of genetic analyses to locate and identify the genes that produce reproductive barriers between distinct species of the fruit fly Drosophila: barriers like hybrid sterility, ecological differentiation, and mate discrimination. Through finding patterns in the location and action of such genes, he hopes to work out the evolutionary processes that originally produced genetic change, and to determine whether different pairs of species may show similar genetic patterns, implying similar routes to speciation.\n\nCoyne has written over 110 refereed scientific papers and 80 other articles, book reviews, and columns, as well as a scholarly book about his field (Speciation, co-authored with H. Allen Orr). He is a frequent contributor to The New Republic, The Times Literary Supplement, and other popular periodicals.\n\n\nPraise for Why Evolution is True\n\nCarl Zimmer\n\nEvolution is the foundation of modern biology, and in Why Evolution Is True, Jerry Coyne masterfully explains why. From the vast trove of evidence of evolution scientists have gathered, Coyne has carefully selected some of the most striking examples and explained them with equal parts grace and authority.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Carl Zimmer, author of Microcosm: E. coli and the New Science of Life\n\nChristopher Hitchens\n\nIts ignorant opponents like to say that the process of evolution by natural selection is only a theory. (That is how they prove their ignorance.) Jerry Coyne shows with elegance and rigor that it is a hypothesis that meets and withstands all tests, and strengthens itself as a theory thereby. One could almost say that it had the distinct merit of being true.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Christopher Hitchens, author of God is Not Great\n\nNeil Shubin\n\nWhy Evolution is True is the book I was hoping would be written someday: an engaging and accessible account of one of the most important ideas ever conceived by mankind. The book is a stunning achievement, written by one of the world\\\\\\'s leading evolutionary biologists. Coyne has produced a classic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ whether you are an expert or novice in science, a friend or foe of evolutionary biology, reading Why Evolution is True is bound to be an enlightening experience.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Neil Shubin, author of Your Inner Fish\n\nSam Harris\n\nJerry Coyne has long been one of the world\\\\\\'s most skillful defenders of evolutionary science in the face of religious obscurantism. In Why Evolution is True, he has produced an indispensable book: the single, accessible volume that makes the case for evolution. But Coyne has delivered much more than the latest volley in our culture war; he has given us an utterly fascinating, lucid, and beautifully written account of our place in the natural world. If you want to better understand your kinship with the rest of life, this book is the place to start.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sam Harris, founder of the Reason Project and author of the New York Times best sellers The End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation\n\nSteven Pinker\n\nScientists dont use the word true lightly, but in this lively and engrossing book, Jerry Coyne shows why biologists are happy to use it when it comes to evolution. Evolution is true not because the experts say it is, nor because some world view demands it, but because the evidence overwhelmingly supports it. There are many superb books on evolution, but this one is superb in a new way ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it explains out the latest evidence for evolution lucidly, thoroughly, and with devastating effectiveness.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Steven Pinker, Harvard University, and author of The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature\n\nE.O. Wilson\n\nFor anyone who wishes a clear, well-written explanation of evolution by one of the foremost scientists working on the subject, Why Evolution is True should be your choice.\n\nRichard Dawkins\n\nI once wrote that anybody who didnt believe in evolution must be stupid, insane or ignorant, and I was then careful to add that ignorance is no crime. I should now update my statement. Anybody who doesnt believe in evolution is stupid, insane, or hasnt read Jerry Coyne. I defy any reasonable person to read this marvellous book and still take seriously the breathtaking inanity that is intelligent design, or its country cousin, young earth creationism.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Richard Dawkins, author of The God Delusion\n\n\nGeneral Information\n===================\nTitle............: Why Evolution is True\nAuthor...........: Jerry A.
