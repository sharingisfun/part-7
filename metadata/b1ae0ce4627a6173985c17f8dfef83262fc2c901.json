But the modern oil industry is an amazingly shady meeting ground of fixers, gangsters, dictators, competing governments, and multinational corporations, and until now, no book has set out to tell the story of this largely hidden world.\n\nThe global fleet of some 11,000 tankersÃ¢â‚¬â€that's tripled during the past decadeÃ¢â‚¬â€moves approximately 2 billion metric tons of oil annually. And every stage of the route, from discovery to consumption, is tainted by corruption and violence, even if little of that is visible to the public.\n\nBased on trips to New York, Washington, Houston, London, Paris, Geneva, Phnom Penh, Dakar, Lagos, Baku, and Moscow, among other far-flung locals, The Secret World of Oil includes up-close portraits of a shadowy Baku-based trader; a high-flying London fixer; and an oil dictator's playboy son who has to choose one of his eleven luxury vehicles when he heads out to party in Los Angeles. Supported by funding from the prestigious Open Society, this is both an entertaining global travelogue and a major work of investigative reporting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1ae0ce4627a6173985c17f8dfef83262fc2c901","amp;dn":"The+Secret+World+of+Oil.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1ae0ce4627a6173985c17f8dfef83262fc2c901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,174,12,228,98,122,97,115,152,92,23,248,223,239,131,38,47,194,201,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
