We will be covering the nature of fuel and how itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s used to create the impact of an explosion. We will also cover in detail the sections of fluid attributes like temperature, fuel, and density.\n\nIn addition we will look at the attributes individually and in conjunction to one another. We will address the story and concept with detailed illustrations to have an understanding of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Skeleton of ExplosionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nBy the end of this training you will be equipped to create CG explosions in Maya with a sound understanding of its aesthetic and technical dynamics.\n\n\n1.
