Ingram, Daphne Vince-Prue, Peter J. Gregory\r\nWiley-Blackwell |December 2015 | ISBN-10: 111877843X | 392 pages | PDF | 21.1 mb \nhttp://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111877843X.html\r\n\r\nMost conventional gardening books concentrate on how and when to carry out horticultural tasks such as pruning, seed sowing and taking cuttings. Science and the Garden, Third Edition is unique in explaining in straightforward terms some of the science that underlies these practices. It is principally a book of 'Why' Why are plants green? \r\nWhy do some plants only flower in the autumn? \r\nWhy do lateral buds begin to grow when the terminal bud is removed by pruning? \r\nWhy are some plants successful as weeds? \r\nWhy does climate variability and change mean change for gardeners? \r\nBut it also goes on to deal with the 'How', providing rationale behind the practical advice.\r\n\r\nThe coverage is wide-ranging and comprehensive and includes: the diversity, structure, functioning and reproduction of garden plants; nomenclature and classification; genetics and plant breeding; soil properties and soil management; environmental factors affecting growth and development; methods of propagation; size and form; colour, scent and sound; climate; environmental change; protected cultivation; pest, disease and weed diversity and control; post-harvest management and storage; garden ecology and conservation; sustainable horticulture; gardens and human health and wellbeing; and gardens for science.\r\n\r\nThis expanded and fully updated Third Edition of Science and the Garden includes two completely new chapters on important topics:\r\n-  Climate and Other Environmental Changes\r\n-  Health, Wellbeing and Socio-cultural Benefits\r\n\r\nMany of the other chapters have been completely re-written or extensively revised and expanded, often with new authors and/or illustrators, and the remainder have all been carefully updated and re-edited. Published in collaboration with the Royal Horticultural Society, reproduced in full colour throughout, carefully edited and beautifully produced, this new edition remains a key text for students of horticulture and will also appeal to amateur and professional gardeners wishing to know more about the fascinating science behind the plants and practices that are the everyday currency of gardening.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPreface to third edition, xiii\r\nPreface to second edition, xiv\r\nPreface to first edition, xv\r\n1 Diversity in the plant world, 1\r\n2 The plant body: structure and function, 14\r\n3 Reproduction: Securing the future, 37\r\n4 Naming plants, 45\r\n5 Selecting and breeding plants, 55\r\n6 Summary, 75\r\n7 Soil cultivation and fertility, 86\r\n8 The plant environment: Light and water, 102\r\n9 Plants and seasons, 120\r\n10 Growing plants from seed, 139\r\n11 Vegetative propagation, 149\r\n12 Size and form, 166\r\n13 Colour, scent and sound in the garden, 175\r\n14 Climate and weather, 191\r\n15 Climate and other environmental changes, 206\r\n16 Protected cultivation, 214\r\n17 The diversity of the undesirables, 234\r\n18 Controlling the undesirables, 248\r\n19 Maturation, ripening and storage, 262\r\n20 Garden ecology, 278\r\n21 Garden wildlife and conservation, 292\r\n22 Low-input and low-impact gardening, 299\r\n23 Health, well-being and socio-cultural benefits, 307\r\n24 Gardens for science, 320\r\nGlossary, 329\r\nIndex, 355\r\n \nhttp://s14.postimg.org/ghsoi0yc1/Science_and_the_Garden_The_Scientific_Basis_of.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5167599f15020a31b6a6ceca382a7cd46d7fa18","amp;dn":"Science+and+the+Garden+%283rd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5167599f15020a31b6a6ceca382a7cd46d7fa18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,22,117,153,241,80,32,163,27,106,108,236,163,130,167,205,70,215,250,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
