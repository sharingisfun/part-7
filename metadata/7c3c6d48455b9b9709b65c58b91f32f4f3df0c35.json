She is best known for her work during the 1960s, when she released singles such as &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot; (1963), &quot;You Don't Have to Say You Love Me&quot; (1966) and &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot; (1968), and her most acclaimed album Dusty in Memphis (1969).\nWith her distinctive sensual sound, she is an important white soul singer, and at her peak was one of the most successful British female performers, with 18 singles in the Billboard Hot 100 from 1964 to 1970. Her image, supported by a peroxide blonde beehive hairstyle, evening gowns, and heavy make-up, made her an icon of the Swinging Sixties. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Springfield&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Springfield&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDusty Springfield - The Very Best Of Dusty Springfield\n1998 Mercury Records\n\n01  Dusty Springfield - I Only Want To Be With You\n02  Dusty Springfield - In Private\n03  Dusty Springfield - I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\n04  Dusty Springfield - Give Me Time\n05  Dusty Springfield - Some Of Your Lovin'\n06  Dusty Springfield - Goin' Back\n07  Dusty Springfield - You Don't Have To Say You Love Me (Io che non vivo(senza te))\n08  Dusty Springfield with Pet Shop Boys - What Have I Done To Deserve This?
