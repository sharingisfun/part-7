However the Master is not as dead as the Doctor thinks. The Master's essence escapes and sabotages the TARDIS, the Doctor's time machine causing it to crashland in San Franscisco on December 30th 1999. The Doctor requires a beryllium atomic clock to repair the TARDIS, but is shot as he leaves the Ship. Taken to hospital, the Doctor's seventh regeneration is triggered by a medic, confused by his alien metabolism, while the Master takes over a paramedics body. He needs a Time Lord's body to survive - the Doctors'. Newly regenerated the Doctor must fight to save his own eighth body, and the world when the Master sabotages the TARDIS power-source. By midnight on December 31st 1999, the Earth will be pulled through this power-source, a mini-black hole, and only the Doctor can stop if only he can remember who he is...\n\n==================================================================================\n\n[04/03/2011 00:19:44] AutoGK 2.55\n[04/03/2011 00:19:44] OS: Windows Vista (6.1.7601).2\n[04/03/2011 00:19:44] Job started.\n[04/03/2011 00:19:44] Input file: C:\\Users\\Hidden User\\Desktop\\Doctor Who Movie 1996\\VTS_01_0.IFO\n[04/03/2011 00:19:44] Output file: C:\\Users\\Hidden User\\Desktop\\Doctor Who Movie.avi\n[04/03/2011 00:19:44] Output codec: XviD\n[04/03/2011 00:19:44] Audio 1: English AC3 2ch \n[04/03/2011 00:19:44] Subtitles: none\n[04/03/2011 00:19:44] Format: AVI\n[04/03/2011 00:19:44] Target size: 700Mb\n[04/03/2011 00:19:44] Custom resolution settings: maximum width of 640 pixels\n[04/03/2011 00:19:44] Audio 1 settings: VBR MP3 with average bitrate: 112Kbps\n[04/03/2011 00:19:44] Started encoding.\n[04/03/2011 00:19:44] Demuxing and indexing.\n[04/03/2011 00:23:50] Processing file: C:\\Users\\Hidden User\\Desktop\\Doctor Who Movie 1996\\VTS_01_1.VOB\n[04/03/2011 00:23:50] Processing file: C:\\Users\\Hidden User\\Desktop\\Doctor Who Movie 1996\\VTS_01_2.VOB\n[04/03/2011 00:23:50] Processing file: C:\\Users\\Hidden User\\Desktop\\Doctor Who Movie 1996\\VTS_01_3.VOB\n[04/03/2011 00:23:50] Processing file: C:\\Users\\Hidden User\\Desktop\\Doctor Who Movie 1996\\VTS_01_4.VOB\n[04/03/2011 00:23:50] Processing file: C:\\Users\\Hidden User\\Desktop\\Doctor Who Movie 1996\\VTS_01_5.VOB\n[04/03/2011 00:23:50] Source resolution: 720x576\n[04/03/2011 00:23:50] Found PAL source.\n[04/03/2011 00:23:50] Source aspect ratio: 4:3\n[04/03/2011 00:23:50] Analyzing source.\n[04/03/2011 00:32:32] Source has percentage of interlacing in motion areas: 43.28\n[04/03/2011 00:32:32] Source is considered to be interlaced.\n[04/03/2011 00:32:32] Output will contain 128676 frames\n[04/03/2011 00:32:32] Decoding audio.\n[04/03/2011 00:36:23] Normalizing audio.\n[04/03/2011 00:37:15] Encoding audio.\n[04/03/2011 01:05:32] Using VAQ in XviD\n[04/03/2011 01:05:32] Audio1 size: 65,248,563 bytes (62.23 Mb)\n[04/03/2011 01:05:34] Overhead: 5,147,008 bytes (4.91 Mb)\n[04/03/2011 01:05:34] Video size: 663,607,629 bytes (632.87 Mb)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10274e2bca265e4d60e01620ee7896fddfca6dc7","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+Movie+1996+DVDRip+aXXo+Quality+%5BWith+DVD+Cover%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10274e2bca265e4d60e01620ee7896fddfca6dc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,39,78,43,202,38,94,77,96,224,22,32,238,120,150,253,223,202,109,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
