And now the original game&amp;#039;s sequel is more than good enough to catch PlayStation gamers in \nthe web once more.\n\nEnter Electro&amp;#039;s story follows the plans of that nefarious, electricity-spewing bad guy Electro, who&amp;#039;s trying to tap an energy source that&amp;#039;ll make him much more powerful and \ndangerous. After a training level that familiarizes you with the game&amp;#039;s controls \n(and new abilities such as the web-grab, where Spider-Man can send out a web and \npull an object back toward him), you must web-swing around New York City and stop \nElectro, his goons, and various other villains from Spidey&amp;#039;s infamous rogue&amp;#039;s gallery. \nThe cast of heavies include the Shocker, Hammerhead, the Sandman, the Lizard, and \na few others from the first game.\n\nThe plot this time out is a little tighter than the last game&amp;#039;s mix of stories, \nand the game draws on the villains&amp;#039; well-known personas to make each encounter interesting.\n\nAgain, Spider-Man creator Stan Lee narrates the story in his inimitable style, and the voice acting is strong throughout. \nYou can also seek out a few classic Spider-Man covers hidden throughout the game.\n\nSpider-Man 2: Enter Electro is a great sequel; it adds quite a few new tricks and \nvillains, and succeeds in terms of story and plot. \n\n-------------------\nInFo:\nPublisher: Activision\nPlatform: PlayStation\nRelease Date: Oct 19, 2001\nRelease Region: North America\nDistribution: Retail\n\nReview: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/ps/action/spiderman2enterelectro/index.html?tag=result;title;0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/ps/action/spiderman2enterelectro/index.html?tag=result;title;0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n===============================================================================\n\n-&gt; This is fully working on the pc using the included PS1 Emulator.\nThe best alternative to playing this game,it was never released on the pc.\n\n---------------\nInStRuCtIoNS:\n\nExtract all files with latest Winrar or 7zip.\n\nRun psxfin.exe\nHit file/insert cd image, select Spiderman 2 - Enter Electro.img\nPlay!\n\nTo enter fullscreen mode hit alt+Enter\n\nNote:\nThe keyboard works fine, but i would recommend getting a pc controller.\ncheck out dealextreme as they sell decent controllers for next to nothing.\n================================================================================\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nSome more Spiderman games that might interest you:\n\nSpiderman Game [Sep 17, 2001] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3756734&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3756734&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpiderman The Movie Game [2002] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3798799&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3798799&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpiderman 2   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3911076&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3911076&lt;/a&gt;\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4c07e3f45eec44f3d04e554b8b6076df7dd2f45","amp;dn":"Spider-Man+2%3A+Enter+Electro+%5BPs1+-+Working+On+PC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4c07e3f45eec44f3d04e554b8b6076df7dd2f45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,192,126,63,69,238,196,79,61,4,229,84,184,182,7,109,247,221,47,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
