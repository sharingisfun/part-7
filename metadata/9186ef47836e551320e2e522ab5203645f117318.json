Focusing on intrusion detection systems (IDSs), it explains how to establish security solutions for the range of wireless networks, including mobile ad-hoc networks, hybrid wireless networks, and sensor networks.\n\nThis edited volume reviews and analyzes state-of-the-art IDSs for various wireless ad-hoc networks. It includes case studies on honesty-based intrusion detection systems, cluster oriented-based intrusion detection systems, and trust-based intrusion detection systems.\n\nAddresses architecture and organization issues\nExamines the different types of routing attacks for WANs\nExplains how to ensure Quality of Service in secure routing\nConsiders honesty and trust-based IDS solutions\nExplores emerging trends in WAN security\nDescribes the blackhole attack detection technique\n\nSurveying existing trust-based solutions, the book explores the potential of the CORIDS algorithm to provide trust-based solutions for secure mobile applications. Touching on more advanced topics, including security for smart power grids, securing cloud services, and energy-efficient IDSs, this book provides you with the tools to design and build secure next-generation wireless networking environments.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9186ef47836e551320e2e522ab5203645f117318","amp;dn":"Intrusion+Detection+in+Wireless+Ad-Hoc+Networks+2014+%5BPDF%5D%7EStorm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9186ef47836e551320e2e522ab5203645f117318","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,134,239,71,131,110,85,19,32,226,229,34,171,82,3,100,95,17,115,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
