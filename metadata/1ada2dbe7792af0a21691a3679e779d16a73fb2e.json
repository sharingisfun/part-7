Her dead body is found upstream several \nweeks later, consistent with the accidental death theory. Based on \nincidents around him, her grieving husband, architect Jonathan Rivers, \ndecides several months later to visit with Raymond Price, who approached \nJohn prior to Anna's body being found with news that she was trying to \ncontact him from beyond. At that time, John was skeptical of Raymond's \nclaims of electronic voice phenomena (EVP): that he is contacted from \nthe beyond through electronic means - radio, television - which he is \nable to record. Along with Sarah Tate, another of Raymond's clients \nwhose fiancÃƒÂ© passed away, John becomes obsessed with EVP as he gets\nmore and more audio and video messages, however fuzzy, from Anna from \nbeyond. That obsession takes a slight change in focus when John \nbelieves that Anna is trying to pass along information to help others. \nBut the nature of those messages and their connection to Raymond in \ncombination with John learning that not all good comes through EVP \nleads to the possible belief that he dabbling in EVP in and of itself \nmay be dangerous and the cause of those potentially deadly issues in \nwhich he is supposed to assist in helping. John has to decide whether \nor not to continue with his work in EVP, not continuing which means \nthat he may actually prevent bad things from happening, and \ncontinuing which means that he gets his much wanted connection \nwith Anna.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Michael Keaton.\n=&gt;-Deborah Kara Unger.\n=&gt;-Ian McNeice.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Geoffrey Sax.\n\nWhite Noise 2 The Light.\nAbe Dale witnesses his wife and son's murders, before the attacker turns \nthe gun on himself. Distraught, Abe attempts suicide but is found by a \nfriend and taken to hospital. Abe has a near death experience, and upon \nrecovery he sees white light emanating from some people. He begins to \nexperience electronic voice phenomena when in close proximity to any \nelectrical device. Discovering that those who manifest the light die \nshortly after, Abe develops a new sense of being as a hero, saving those \nemitting the white aura from death. But all is not as it seems, as he \nunravels the mystery surrounding the death of his family while being \nhaunted by angry spirits, realising in the process that no good deed \ngoes unpunished.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Nathan Fillion.\n=&gt;-Katee Sackhoff.\n=&gt;-Craig Fairbrass.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Patrick Lussier.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Drama : Horror : Thriller.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2005 : 2007.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.30 GiB : 1.32 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1906 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 37mn : 1h 39mn.\n=&gt;-White Noise................: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375210/\n=&gt;-White Noise................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/white_noise/\n=&gt;-White Noise 2 The Light....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0496436/\n=&gt;-White Noise 2 The Light....: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/white_noise_2/\n\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 544.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1789 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 200 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ada2dbe7792af0a21691a3679e779d16a73fb2e","amp;dn":"White+Noise+1%2C+2+-+Horror+2005-2007+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ada2dbe7792af0a21691a3679e779d16a73fb2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,218,45,190,119,146,175,10,33,105,26,54,121,231,121,209,106,115,251,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
