DH Lawrence\\'s portrayal of women has long been the subject of debate - so what are we to make of it? A sibling carer is an older brother or sister who looks after their family, perhaps because a parent has died. As a report highlights the vital role they play, Jenni discusses whether they are being failed by social services. Kate Middleton\\'s recent appearance in a fascinator has propelled the look onto the fashion pages, so how, and when, should you wear one? And Tanya Ewing is one of the three businesswomen being followed by Woman\\'s Hour. We eavesdrop on her first meeting with her mentor, Nora Senior.\n\n\nThanks to those helping me seed.
