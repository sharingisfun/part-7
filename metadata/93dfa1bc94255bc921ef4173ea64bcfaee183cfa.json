With little regulation or science, the treatment industry has become a cash cow business that continues to grow while deaths pile up. Through unique access to internationally recognized treatment facilities, as well as emotional stories of addicts and their families, the film reveals how the treatment industry in the United States preys on addicts with little more than promises of hope and a huge bill. The film challenges us to reconsider our assumptions about treating addiction and the human cost we will pay by allowing the industry to continue business as usual","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93dfa1bc94255bc921ef4173ea64bcfaee183cfa","amp;dn":"The.Business.of.Recovery.2015.720p.WEBRip.x264.AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93dfa1bc94255bc921ef4173ea64bcfaee183cfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,223,161,188,148,37,91,201,33,239,65,115,234,100,188,250,238,24,60,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
