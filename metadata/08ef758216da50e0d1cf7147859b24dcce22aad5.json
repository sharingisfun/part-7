Sink your teeth into six classic episodes of the popular Discovery special series and learn the secrets of shark whisperers and lessons of survivors of grisly shark attacks. The Shark Week DVDs in the 2 disc set let you swim shark-infested waters without leaving your living room.\n\n\n\n\n4)  Top Five Eaten Alive \nThis documentary explores the details behind five different but equally grisly shark attacks. We hear from the five different survivors about what they went through and how they survived - one woman describing what it was like to have a limb bitten off by a shark (&quot;there was a pop... then it was gone.&quot;). Re-enactments demonstrate what they did right, but equally important, what they did wrong and how they wound up in these life threatening situations in the first place. We learn about how the sharks reacted and how a few different heroic bystanders interjected to save lives.\n\n5)  Shark Feeding Frenzy \nWith this entry in the series, we learn how food and the need for food control almost every facet of a shark's life. In turn, this leads to feeding frenzies. We learn about Reef, Tiger, Hammerhead, Lemon and Great White Sharks feeding habits. From there, we learn how to best survive a feeding frenzy or, preferably, how to avoid them. Some fantastic footage peppers this documentary quite nicely and really helps drive home just how dangerous and intense a feeding frenzy can get - at one point we witness a shark latch onto a cameraman's arm (thankfully he's wearing a chain mail suit, so he doesn't lose the limb). The documentary also explores the reality behind whether or not sharks really do or do not like to eat people.\n\n6)  Sharkman \nThe last documentary in the collection explores the interesting life of a man named Michael Rutzman, who enjoys swimming (unprotected) with Great White Sharks. He believes they have a passive and non-aggressive side and to prove this he tries to hypnotize them. The results of Rutzman's experiments and theories are varied but surprisingly not invalid. We see, on camera, how Rutzman does succeed in getting the sharks to appreciate his touch and to react to it - now, this doesn't mean they get friendly and want to cuddle, but it does give his theories some basis in reality.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/623/j1dd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/623/j1dd.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img200.imageshack.us/img200/6246/8ru9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img200.imageshack.us/img200/6246/8ru9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/5995/0lli.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/5995/0lli.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/5241/q79r.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/5241/q79r.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/4129/jrdj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/4129/jrdj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/4084/lu88.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/4084/lu88.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/2584/v2f5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/2584/v2f5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/1440/yww0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/1440/yww0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/7653/8852.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/7653/8852.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img441.imageshack.us/img441/5858/fwdm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img441.imageshack.us/img441/5858/fwdm.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/9679/qk0f.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/9679/qk0f.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img90.imageshack.us/img90/4562/h28c.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img90.imageshack.us/img90/4562/h28c.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;85cdece2edc5c9b1abb5&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1340 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: Parts 1, 2, 6 = 84mins 3, 4, 5 42mins\n * Framerate: 29fps\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: average Parts 1, 2, 6 =812 MB - 3, 4, 5= 637 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/27/arts/television/27shar.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/27/arts/television/27shar.html?_r=0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Ocean%20of%20Fear%3A%20Worst%20Shark%20Attack%20Ever&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Ocean%20of%20Fear%3A%20Worst%20Shark%20Attack%20Ever&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08ef758216da50e0d1cf7147859b24dcce22aad5","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+SharkWeek+4of6+Top+Five+Eaten+Alive+DVDRip+x264+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08ef758216da50e0d1cf7147859b24dcce22aad5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,239,117,130,22,218,80,224,209,207,113,71,133,155,36,220,206,34,170,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
