Quimby, &quot;Photonics and Lasers: An Introduction&quot;\nEnglish | ISBN: 0471719749 | 2006 | PDF | 536 pages \n\nThis book evolved from a series of courses developed by the author and taught in the areas of lasers and photonics. This thoroughly classroom-tested work fills a unique need for students, instructors, and industry professionals in search of an introductory-level book that covers a wide range of topics in these areas. Comparable books tend to be aimed either too high or too low, or they cover only a portion of the topics that are needed for a comprehensive treatment.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1003b736ad4f00de012ad97553591283fed2fa3","amp;dn":"Photonics+and+Lasers%3A+An+Introduction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1003b736ad4f00de012ad97553591283fed2fa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,0,59,115,106,212,240,13,224,18,173,151,85,53,145,40,63,237,47,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
