There are songs on her debut mini-album that could have been written by Hank Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­Williams; Shotgun Wedding and Answer in One of These Bottles are so antediluvian in spirit that it's hard to believe they're not cover versions. Add the fact that Rose's bright, bold trill is irresistibly reminiscent of early Loretta Lynn and Wanda Jackson, and the Grand Ole Opry should be Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­calling her any day now. Rose certainly isn't daunted by her heroes, as attested by her gutsy take on Three Cigarettes in an Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­Ashtray, a hit for Patsy Cline. But she is so in thrall to them that it can seem like mimicking. Clearly, this engagingly Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­insouciant personality is still searching for a voice of her own\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e5c9f1ad8f6034420ce3f4078b27ff158d8a614","amp;dn":"Caitlin+Rose...Dead+Flowers%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e5c9f1ad8f6034420ce3f4078b27ff158d8a614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,92,159,26,216,246,3,68,32,206,63,64,120,178,127,241,88,216,166,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
