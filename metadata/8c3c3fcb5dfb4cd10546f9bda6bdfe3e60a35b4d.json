After 15 years as a spiritual teacher, Adyashanti has found that the simpler the teaching, the greater its power to initiate this awakening.\n\nOn Falling into Grace, he shares what he considers fundamental insights to &quot;open ourselves to that mysterious element that enters in the hidden and quiet moments and sparks a revolution in the way that we perceive life.&quot; Wherever you may be on your own spiritual path, you will find in these sessions down-to-earth guidance on breaking the trance of ego, experiencing the raw energy of emotion, cultivating inner stability, transcending the world of opposites, and more.\n\nIn the same way that we fall into the arms of a loved one or drop our heads on the pillow at night, we can surrender into the beauty and truth of who and what we really are. Falling into Grace is a program that gets to the core of why we suffer, and allows us to explore Adyashanti's invitation &quot;to be taken by a moment of grace and fall into a sense of life when it is not separate from you, when life is actually an expression of something indefinable, mysterious, and immense.&quot;\n\nHighlights:\nThe human dilemma - the concept of a separate self and the choice to stop believing the thoughts that perpetuate suffering\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Taking the backward stepÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ into the pure potential of the present moment\nWhy spiritual awakening can be a disturbing process\nIntimacy and availability - feeling absolute union with every part of our experience\nTrue autonomy - the unique expression of our own sense of freedom\n\nThis idea of a book on the &quot;fundamentals of spiritual discovery&quot; became the organizing principle for a series of talks given over five days in the fall of 2009, in Los Gatos, California. These talks were then transcribed and edited into Falling into Grace.\n\nÃ‚Â©2011 Adyashanti (P)2011 Adyashanti","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c3c3fcb5dfb4cd10546f9bda6bdfe3e60a35b4d","amp;dn":"Adyashanti+-+Falling+Into+Grace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c3c3fcb5dfb4cd10546f9bda6bdfe3e60a35b4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,60,63,203,93,251,76,209,5,70,249,189,166,189,254,62,96,163,91,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
