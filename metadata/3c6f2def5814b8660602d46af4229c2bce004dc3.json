The lable said &quot;near mint,&quot; and that was only a slight exaggeration. This is a wonderful sounding pressing of one of my favorite albums. I split the album into five tracks because that is the format to which we are accustomed. I used the preset named &quot;Old Record - Quiet Audio&quot; in Cool Edit Pro's Click/Pop Eliminator on the first 21 seconds.I used Click/Pop Eliminator's &quot;Fill Single Click Now&quot; option to eliminate two other pops. No other noise reduction or editing was done.I also included cue files that divide the album into the twelve tracks that are implied on the album lable. Just open the file &quot;Multiple FLAC (5 files, 12 tracks).cue&quot; with foobar or AutoFLAC if you would like the five files displayed as twelve tracks instead of five.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee the transfer log for a few more details.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe album was transcribed on a Technics SL-1200MK5 turntable with custom \nmodifications by KAB Electro-Acoustics using a Stanton Groove Master II \ncartridge with Pickering elliptical stylus, also from KAB. The preamp was a \nVelleman 8021 Control Amplifier. Analog to digital converson to 24-bit/96kHz was \nwith an E-MU-0202. Recording was on a Sony VAIO desktop computer with a 3.0 GHz \nPentium IV processor using Cool Edit Pro 2.1  at 32-bit/96kHz, floating. Extra \n&quot;silence&quot; at the beginning, end and between sides was trimmed in Cool Edit Pro. \nNo volume adjustment was required. \n\nI found the &quot;static&quot; during the quiet beginning of track one to be distracting, \nso I used the preset named &quot;Old Record - Quiet Audio&quot; in Cool Edit Pro's \nClick/Pop Eliminator on the first 21 seconds (seconds:frames).I used Click/Pop \nEliminator's &quot;Fill Single Click Now&quot; option to eliminate two other pops. No \nother noise reduction or editing was done. Cues were dropped and named and the \nfile saved as a 24-bit 96kHz type 1 wav. This file was opened in GoldWave to \nextract and save the image cue file. Metadata was added to the image cue file \nusing foobar. The multiple files cue was created with CUETools (www.moitah.net). \nBoth image file was split into tracks, compressed to FLAC and tagged in \nfoobar2000. M3u files were created with mp3tag.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c6f2def5814b8660602d46af4229c2bce004dc3","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Wish+You+Were+Here+%281975%29%5BVinyl%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c6f2def5814b8660602d46af4229c2bce004dc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,111,45,239,88,20,184,102,6,2,212,106,244,34,156,43,206,0,77,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
