The lush visuals, orchestral music, European styling, wartime romanticism and cliffhanging chapters all add a certain 1950's charm to the white-knuckle plot. So much of this film relies on surprises and shocking twists that it would be unfair  to detail too many plot threads.  I can only say that this thoughtful, poignant and tremendously rousing adventure -   a thrill ride from start to finish ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ will leave you breathless.  The ensamble cast of this film deliver wonderful performances, especially Carice Van Houten, the magnificent and talented Dutch beauty who plays the lead. \n\nNominated for 20087 BAFTA (British Academy Film Award) in the category Best Film not in the English Language and the 2007 British Independent Film Award in the category Best Foreign Independent Film.\n\nRuntime: 145 minutes\nLangages: English is spoken in the film as well as Dutch, German and Hebrew (with English subtitles)\nThis film was made in The Netherlands\nRated ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“RÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in the USA for some strong violence, graphic nudity, sexuality and language\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389557/\nIMDB Rating: 8.0/10 (19,500 Votes)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17ab0b8dc936d8b159710bfa218ac34b82ce2e88","amp;dn":"The+Black+Book+%28ZwartBoek%29+2006.+DvDrip.Avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17ab0b8dc936d8b159710bfa218ac34b82ce2e88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,171,11,141,201,54,216,177,89,113,11,250,33,138,195,75,130,206,46,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
