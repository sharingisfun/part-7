He also crystallized one of the most important debates of our time: As we enjoy the NetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bounties, are we sacrificing our ability to read and think deeply? \n \n \nNow, Carr expands his argument into the most compelling exploration of the InternetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intellectual and cultural consequences yet published. As he describes how human thought has been shaped through the centuries by Ã¢â‚¬Å“tools of the mindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€from the alphabet to maps, to the printing press, the clock, and the computerÃ¢â‚¬â€Carr interweaves a fascinating account of recent discoveries in neuroscience by such pioneers as Michael Merzenich and Eric Kandel. Our brains, the historical and scientific evidence reveals, change in response to our experiences. The technologies we use to find, store, and share information can literally reroute our neural pathways. \n \n \nBuilding on the insights of thinkers from Plato to McLuhan, Carr makes a convincing case that every information technology carries an intellectual ethicÃ¢â‚¬â€a set of assumptions about the nature of knowledge and intelligence. He explains how the printed book served to focus our attention, promoting deep and creative thought. In stark contrast, the Internet encourages the rapid, distracted sampling of small bits of information from many sources. Its ethic is that of the industrialist, an ethic of speed and efficiency, of optimized production and consumptionÃ¢â‚¬â€and now the Net is remaking us in its own image. We are becoming ever more adept at scanning and skimming, but what we are losing is our capacity for concentration, contemplation, and reflection. \n \n \nPart intellectual history, part popular science, and part cultural criticism, The Shallows sparkles with memorable vignettesÃ¢â‚¬â€Friedrich Nietzsche wrestling with a typewriter, Sigmund Freud dissecting the brains of sea creatures, Nathaniel Hawthorne contemplating the thunderous approach of a steam locomotiveÃ¢â‚¬â€even as it plumbs profound questions about the state of our modern psyche. This is a book that will forever alter the way we think about media and our minds.\n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f27f28f1f506b0ea647bc3c50df393073cb2f546","amp;dn":"%5BPulitzer+finalist%5D+The+Shallows+-+What+the+Internet+Is+Doing+to","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f27f28f1f506b0ea647bc3c50df393073cb2f546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,127,40,241,245,6,176,234,100,123,195,197,13,243,147,7,60,178,245,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
