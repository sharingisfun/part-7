Coming back home to America, Celeste is glad to see the end of the peril she has been inÃ¢â‚¬â€or so she thinks. Danger seems to follow Celeste and she finds it in the shape of Amy. What Celeste feels for Amy scares her more than anything she has faced in war zones. \n\nAmy has the same feelings, but is in denial and vows to marry Josh, CelesteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twin brother, no matter what. When fate brings them together again, will they give in to their mutual attraction or will they once again deny what they feel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64c70f26d5fc9613a1f8a982563ba9670fe82898","amp;dn":"FF+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64c70f26d5fc9613a1f8a982563ba9670fe82898","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,199,15,38,213,252,150,19,161,248,169,130,86,59,169,103,15,232,40,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
