A global crisis extended from England to Japan, and from the Russian Empire to sub-Saharan Africa. North and South America, too, suffered turbulence. The distinguished historian Geoffrey Parker examines first-hand accounts of men and women throughout the world describing what they saw and suffered during a sequence of political, economic and social crises that stretched from 1618 to the 1680s.\n\nParker also deploys scientific evidence concerning climate conditions of the period, and his use of Ã¢â‚¬ËœnaturalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as well as Ã¢â‚¬ËœhumanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ archives transforms our understanding of the World Crisis. Changes in the prevailing weather patterns during the 1640s and 1650s Ã¢â‚¬â€œ longer and harsher winters, and cooler and wetter summers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ disrupted growing seasons, causing dearth, malnutrition, and disease, along with more deaths and fewer births. Some contemporaries estimated that one-third of the world died, and much of the surviving historical evidence supports their pessimism.\n\nParkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demonstration of the link between climate change and worldwide catastrophe 350 years ago stands as an extraordinary historical achievement. And the contemporary implications of his study are equally important: are we at all prepared today for the catastrophes that climate change could bring tomorrow?\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | History","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78935e644a1598d87ee42ac9d2e5dcec41d3f785","amp;dn":"Global+Crisis+by+Geoffrey+Parker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78935e644a1598d87ee42ac9d2e5dcec41d3f785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,147,94,100,74,21,152,216,126,228,42,201,210,229,220,236,65,211,247,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
