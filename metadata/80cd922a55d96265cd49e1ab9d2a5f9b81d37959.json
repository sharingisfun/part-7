RA is very well produced and done in a solid Nashville Sound/mellow country tradition. Like &quot;the Best&quot;, all 11 tracks made the Billboard charts, this batch between 1976 and 1980. This reviewer loved &quot;How to Be a Country Star&quot; which is a tribute to several icons in the field. &quot;Silver Medals and Sweet Memories&quot; is a heartfelt tribute to a dad who never returned from WW2 and I actually used &quot;Your Picture In the Papers&quot; as background for a Toastmasters speech! What's not to like? Statler fans who don't own this one can safely buy it. The curious should be brave and at least click on some of the audio samples. If &quot;Rides Again&quot; won't make you a fan, nothing else will. This is still the original 4 from Staunton, VA; Harold, Phil, Don and the late Lew DeWitt with that trademarked tight harmony. I believe Lew's health problems led to his leaving the group shortly after the time frame that &quot;Rides Again&quot; brackets.[/quote]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/RkWeQhCVxH.jpg[/img]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nStatler Brothers, The - The Best of the Statler Bros.
