Rich with Lewis' own words, framed by BraggÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s richly atmospheric narrative, this is the last great untold rock-and-roll story, come to life on the page","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7627b947c7f1abce546e486bb79446a83f473b5b","amp;dn":"Jerry+Lee+Lewis%3A+His+Own+Story+-+Rick+Bragg+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7627b947c7f1abce546e486bb79446a83f473b5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,39,185,71,199,241,171,206,84,110,72,107,183,148,70,168,63,71,59,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
