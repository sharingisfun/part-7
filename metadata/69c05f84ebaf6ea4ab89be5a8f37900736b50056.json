Exploring the Acropolis and delighting in the tastes of moussaka and baklava, Michael discovers the many influences at play in the creation of modern Greece - from its classical past to the oriental Ottomans and the great European powers of Britain, France and Russia. Along the way, Michael discovers the parlous state of Greek finances at the time of his guidebook. He learns how an aristocratic English poet became a Greek national hero and relives Greek athletic victory at the first modern Olympic games. Travelling through the Corinth Canal, Michael finds out about the surprisingly ancient origins of the modern railway. In Delphi, he discovers how at the turn of the 20th century an entire village was removed in order to excavate the site of the oracle. Boarding one of the narrowest gauge railways in the world, the Little Train of Pelion, Michael travels to the village of Milies, where he learns about the place of the Orthodox church in Greek national life. Michael ends his journey in Thessaloniki, where Greece's King George I was assassinated in 1913.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/18/Great-Continental-Railway-Journeys-Series4-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/74/Great-Continental-Railway-Journeys-Series4-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/df/Great-Continental-Railway-Journeys-Series4-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7a/Great-Continental-Railway-Journeys-Series4-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/91/Great-Continental-Railway-Journeys-Series4-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/92/Great-Continental-Railway-Journeys-Series4-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bd/Great-Continental-Railway-Journeys-Series4-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cd/Great-Continental-Railway-Journeys-Series4-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/03/Great-Continental-Railway-Journeys-Series4-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/12/Great-Continental-Railway-Journeys-Series4-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/95/Great-Continental-Railway-Journeys-Series4-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/28/Great-Continental-Railway-Journeys-Series4-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3243Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Part Size: 1.39 GB (average)\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rdqn7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69c05f84ebaf6ea4ab89be5a8f37900736b50056","amp;dn":"BBC+Great+Continental+Railway+Journeys+Series4+4of6+Athens+to+Th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69c05f84ebaf6ea4ab89be5a8f37900736b50056","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,192,95,132,235,175,110,164,171,137,190,90,143,55,144,7,54,181,0,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
