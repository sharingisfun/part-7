And while one is advised to dive in directly with any one of his Blue Note discs -- especially Soul Station, No Room for Squares, and A Slice of the Top -- this ten-track overview still works well as a launching pad. \nBacked by a stellar array of &quot;Blue Note&quot; regulars like Lee Morgan, Curtis Fuller, Billy Higgins, Freddie Hubbard, and Horace Silver, Mobley ranges effortlessly from early hard bop favorites (&quot;Funk in a Deep Freeze&quot;) to mature, solo-rich material from the mid-'60s (&quot;The Turnaround&quot;). \nIn between, there are two stunning originals from his banner year of 1960 (&quot;This I Dig of You,&quot; &quot;Take Your Pick&quot;) and one of the best of his several bossa nova numbers (&quot;Recado Bossa Nova&quot;). \nFor listeners who just want a taste, this best-of collection will do the trick just fine.
