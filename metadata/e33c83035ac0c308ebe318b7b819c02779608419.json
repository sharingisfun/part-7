STOP READING IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED YET&gt;\n\n\n\nThe finale of How I Met Your Mother was unforgivable. \n\nThey ruined Barney and Robin. They took a beautiful, poignant relationship situation with Ted and his soul mate and shoehorned in some bullshit with Robin.\n\nOn and on. The finale was terrible.\n\nI fixed it.\n\nThe divorce? Gone. The blue horn? Gone. \n\nIt's still a little rough and I struggled with whether to leave the baby stuff in there with Barney, but it's implied now that Barney and Robin fix their shit and somehow, magically, have a baby. I thought it showed that Barney grew up one more little bit. I think it should feel like Robin is just a crazy work-a-holic.\n\nMost importantly it now ends focused on Ted and his soul mate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e33c83035ac0c308ebe318b7b819c02779608419","amp;dn":"How+I+Met+Your+Mother+-+S09E23+S09E24+-+Last+Forever+A+Second+Op","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e33c83035ac0c308ebe318b7b819c02779608419","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,60,131,3,90,192,195,8,235,227,24,183,184,25,192,39,121,96,132,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
