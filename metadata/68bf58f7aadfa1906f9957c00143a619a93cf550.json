The program, even in basic application, can predict handload chamber pressure and resulting ME, MV and trajectory based on  identification of handload components used, even if the cartridge is a wildcat creation or a new factory release.\n\nI&amp;#039;ve used QuickLOAD to develop initial loads for the 358-378 RG wildcat project, as well as for the 270 WSM when few published loads were available. I&amp;#039;ve even used QuickLOAD in parallel with published handloading manuals, so I would have a better understanding of what I was feeding into a firearm that would be discharged close to my head; not protection of a exceptionally valuable asset, but still.... \n\nQuickLOAD is not a single tool solution for the creation of handloads, it is made to be used conservatively and in concert with all live fire testing and routine handloading precautions. While there are several program limitations, the author openly addresses and explains each within QuickLoad documentation. As an example, QuickLOAD does not work as well with long cylindrical cartridges; the longer the case, the less accurate the results  - typically the program overstates pressure. QuickLOAD can&amp;#039;t always predict the pressure of powder used at pressure levels beyond the powder&amp;#039;s intended use (i.e. shotgun powder designed for 15,000 PSI used in handguns at 40,000 PSI). The QuickLOAD book that accompanies QuickLOAD offers some excellent insight into these and other handload dynamics.\n\nQuickLOAD is data heavy, it comes with built in databases for: specific brands and types of smokeless powder, bullet lists and specs from virtually every manufacturer and a huge list of cartridges including cartridge dimensions and capacity. This information is dynamically linked, so changing the overall length of a cartridge will result in a change in case capacity, which will be reflected in a pressure change. When you work up a handload, QuickLoad will provide everything from  a reference SAAMI and CIP pressure specifications to the probable percent of powder burned before a bullet leaves the barrel. The program&amp;#039;s results even include temperature of combustion. If you don&amp;#039;t find the cartridge or components of your choice, you can add your own entries to the applicable database, QuickLOAD will make it a permanent record that will survive even future updates.  Powder files are an exception, where new products can be added if enough product information is available, but the original files will also remain intact.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the March 14th update is that the program is now distributed on CD rather than floppy disk. Thank God, my computer always made odd faces whenever I went in search of its floppy drive. The update process was an easy deal, taking only a few minutes. Cartridge listings have been significantly revamped. They now include the everything from the .19 Calhoun and .204 Ruger to all of the Super Short Magnums and 500 S&amp;W. Bullets lists have likewise been overhauled up through the Barnes TSX product. Again, QuickLOAD users can update any of the databases with the own components. For people who hate to let go of anything; pieces of string, bottle caps, etc. QuickLOAD writes older version files into a directory labeled &quot;old&quot;. Each subsequent update results in an additional backup file directory, appended with a numeric progression.\n\nQuickLOAD appears to have played a little database catch up on some mature products. As an example, the Accurate Arms listing was really filled out as indicated below; not really new products, but certainly items not included in the prior release. Hodgdon&amp;#039;s Retumbo unfortunately didn&amp;#039;t make the new list, but I&amp;#039;ll survive the disappointment, QuickLOAD carries powder listing from virtually every worldwide source even if  they are not widely distributed in all regions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68bf58f7aadfa1906f9957c00143a619a93cf550","amp;dn":"Quikload+3.2+internial+Ballistics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68bf58f7aadfa1906f9957c00143a619a93cf550","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,191,88,247,170,223,161,144,111,153,87,192,1,67,166,25,169,60,245,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
