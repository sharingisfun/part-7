This thriller stars a rogue Polish-American cop (Mickey Rourke) out to not only keep Chinatown safe for the local consumers, but to dismantle its deep-rooted crime and drug cartels as well. No one backs the crusading cop in the latter objective, and as he faces a suave and wily crime boss (John Lone of The Last Emperor) and a libidinous newscaster (Ariane), he may be taking on more than he can handle. At least his wife thinks so, and the guys at City Hall think so -- but mayhem and murder will strew the streets with corpses before the smoke clears and the dust settles, and a vague, unresolved future sets in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Mickey Rourke, John Lone, Ariane\r\nDIRECTOR......: Michael Cimino\r\nWRITERS.......: Oliver Stone, Michael Cimino\r\nGENRE.........: Crime | Drama | Action\r\nRATING........: 6.9/10  10,292 votes\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090350\r\nRUNTIME.......: 2h 14mn\r\nSIZE..........: 5.50GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x816\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 2.35:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 5000 Kbps (3 pass)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO 1.......: English DTS 5.1 768kbps\r\nAUDIO 2.......: Commentary with Michael Cimino\r\nSOURCE........: Year.of.the.Dragon.1985.1080p.Bluray.Remux.DTS-HD.AVC\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG  \r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2016-06-12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSample video/screens included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa639d6b60cd15342ce71d1b12434e9835877352","amp;dn":"Year.Of.The.Dragon.1985.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa639d6b60cd15342ce71d1b12434e9835877352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,99,157,107,96,205,21,52,44,231,29,27,18,67,78,152,53,135,115,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
