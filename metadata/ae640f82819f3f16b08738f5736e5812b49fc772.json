But when he finds Lex, he also finds someone he wasn't looking for: his sister-in-law, Kitty, who along with Myron's brother abandoned the Bolitar family long ago.\n\nAs Myron races to locate his missing brother while their father clings to life, he must face the lies that led to the estrangement - including the ones told by Myron himself. If we thought we knew Myron Bolitar, Coben now proves we didn't. An electric, stay-up-all night thriller that unfolds at a breakneck pace, Live Wire proves that Harlan Coben still has the ability to shock us anew","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae640f82819f3f16b08738f5736e5812b49fc772","amp;dn":"Harlan+Coben+Live+Wire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae640f82819f3f16b08738f5736e5812b49fc772","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,100,15,130,129,159,63,22,176,135,56,245,115,110,88,18,180,159,199,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
