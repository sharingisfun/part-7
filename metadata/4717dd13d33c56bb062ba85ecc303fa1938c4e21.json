Unlike the other two, Sergei Eisenstein and V. I. Pudovkin, Dovzhenko was Ukrainian and worked mostly in Odessa and Kiev, which allowed him a bit more freedom as he wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t constantly under StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nose in Moscow.\n\nDovzhenko's great rural trilogy (Arsenal in 1929, Zemlya in 1930, and Ivan in 1932) seems to move beyond the immediate political concerns of the Revolution into a personal and emotional realm; feeling triumphs over agitprop.\n\nArsenal is, of course, first and foremost, a war picture, dealing with the civil strife following the overthrow of the Czar. In keeping with his conception of cinema as poetry, Dovzhenko developed a unique style replete with symbols, metaphors, and poetic intertitles, somewhat removed from the conventions of cinematic narrative Ã¢â‚¬â€ even those pioneered by other Soviet filmmakers.\n\nSet in the bleak aftermath and devastation of World War One, a recently demobbed soldier, Timosh, returns to his hometown Kiev, after having survived a train wreck. His arrival coincides with a national celebration of Ukrainian freedom, but the festivities are not to last.\n\n\nVideo: XviD, 528x400, 25.000 fps, 1097 kbps, 01h28m02\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 224 kbps\n\nOptional subtitles: English\n                    Spanish\n                    Portuguese-BR\n                    Galician\n                    Persian\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EadmeAAGB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EadmeAAGB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eadmIAaGb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eadmIAaGb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAdMbaAgb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAdMbaAgb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fADMDAAGB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fADMDAAGB&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDVD Rip, thanks to RL, June 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4717dd13d33c56bb062ba85ecc303fa1938c4e21","amp;dn":"Arsenal+%28Soviet+Union+-+1929+-+%D0%90%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%29+multi+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4717dd13d33c56bb062ba85ecc303fa1938c4e21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,23,221,19,211,60,86,187,6,43,168,94,204,48,63,161,147,140,78,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
