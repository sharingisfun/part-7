ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Porn Generation\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s everywhere, from commercials to New York Times bestsellers to college (and even younger) classrooms. In fact, pornography has become such a part of normal life in 21st century America that many teens and twenty-somethings have had no more important influence. They are the porn generation, where lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expectations come from Mouseketeer pop tarts, VictoriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Secret, Internet titillation, and condom-flogging sex education.\n\nTom WolfeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novel Charlotte Simmons told part of the storyÃ¢â‚¬â€but in Porn Generation itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s for real. Ben Shapiro speaks as a member of this generation, and the tale he has to tell is a shocking perspective on life in an age where moral relativism reigns on college campuses, oversexed narcissism rules the airwaves, and purity is the new sin.\n\nIn Porn Generation youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn: Ã‚Â· How porn producers see themselves as shaping and taking over Mainstreet U.S.A. Ã‚Â· The real face of taxpayer-funded sex education: nine-year-olds learning about condoms; twelve-year-olds being questioned about their &quot;sexual orientation&quot; Ã‚Â· The new collegiate doÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (accepting &quot;sexile&quot;) and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ts (&quot;dormcest&quot;) Ã‚Â· How Hollywood and TV have mainstreamed pornography: why porn stars now turn up regularly on television and in glossy adsÃ¢â‚¬â€and why celebrities imitate porn stars Ã‚Â· Mamas, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let your daughters grow up to be co-eds: why on college campusesÃ¢â‚¬â€and throughout the porn generationÃ¢â‚¬â€sexual relationships are as disposable as used condoms Is there any good news? Yes. A lifestyle of playing pimps and hosÃ¢â‚¬â€even if dressed up in preppie clothingÃ¢â‚¬â€can only last so long before disease, despair, and depression set inÃ¢â‚¬â€and many in the porn generation are beginning to wake up to their tragedy. Ben Shapiro closes Porn Generation with a roundtable discussion that brings together the diverse perspectives of columnist and bestselling author Michelle Malkin, Dallas Morning News op-ed editor Rod Dreher, former Princeton chaplain Father C. J. McCloskey III, and columnist and bestselling author David Limbaugh to discuss how bad things have become and what the prospects are for bringing the porn generation back from the brink. Porn Generation is the book that will define this generationÃ¢â‚¬â€and provide a warning for generations to come.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nBenjamin Shapiro entered UCLA at the age of sixteen and graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in June 2004 with a BA in political science.
