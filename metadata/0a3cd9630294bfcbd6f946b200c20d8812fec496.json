The album was released in 1983 and reached number 20 in the UK charts.\n\nAnd it was the first album by Motorhead that I bought. More later on that.\nAfter guitarist &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke left MotÃƒÂ¶rhead in 1982 on their second US tour, guitarist Brian &quot;Robbo&quot; Robertson (ex-Thin Lizzy, Wild Horses) was recruited to complete the tour. \nA more accomplished, less &quot;feel&quot;-based guitarist than Clarke had been, the change was welcome by vocalist/bassist Lemmy and drummer Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor initially; in Joel McIver's book Overkill: The Untold Story of Motohead, Lemmy is quoted at the time saying that the band's sound had &quot;changed a little now that Brian's joined the band; I think it's gotten more musical&quot;. \n\nThese feelings would change dramatically once they entered the studio with producer Tony Platt; Lemmy would recall years later in the Motorhead documentary The Guts and the Glory: &quot;Recording Another Perfect Day was fucking torture. \n\nBrian, he'd take seventeen hours doin' a guitar track. It fuckin' took so long compared with the other albums. And then when it was released everybody fucking hated it&quot;. The original vinyl release featured a lyric-sheet insert, with a cartoon storyboard of the adventures of the new band, as it were. The cassette and US LP versions had a vastly different track list, with &quot;I Got Mine&quot; opening the album and &quot;Back at the Funny Farm&quot; opening side two.\n\nThe band supported the album with the &quot;Another Perfect Tour&quot; tour, and almost immediately audiences and industry personnel alike took notice of the jarring contrast between Lemmy and Taylor.\nWe had to get another guitar player fast do we could continue the tour, and we chose Brian Robertson, who had been in Thin Lizzy. \nTechnically, he was a better guitarist than Eddie, but ultimately he wasn't right for Motorhead. \n\nWith Robbo our slide downwards began to pick up speed, which was unfair really, because the record we made with him, Another Perfect Day, was very good...Another Perfect Day stood the test of time - a lot of fans have recanted now and come to like it. But that didn't help us back then.\n\nFollowing the album and tour, Robertson and drummer Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor left MotÃƒÂ¶rhead to form the band Operator, leaving Lemmy Kilmister to continue on with MotÃƒÂ¶rhead. None of the songs from Another Perfect Day were performed live after Robertson's departure in 1983 until 1994. \nSince then, &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;Die You Bastard!&quot;, &quot;Dancing on Your Grave&quot;, &quot;I Got Mine&quot;, &quot;Another Perfect Day&quot; and &quot;Rock It&quot; have been featured in the band's live set. \n\nIn 2013, Lemmy told Lee Marlow of Classic Rock that he hadn't spoken to Robinson since 1983 and maintained, &quot;I've enjoyed all the line-ups Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but not that one.\n\nDeluxe Edition (Sanctuary Records 2006 reissue)\n\nIn 2006, the album was re-issued by Sanctuary Records with a bonus CD, featuring a live performance, recorded at Manchester Apollo on 10 June 1983. \nThe writing credits for the songs on the deluxe edition differed from those on the original, credited all the original songs to Robertson, Kilmister, and Taylor.\n\nAll songs written and composed by Ian Kilmister, Phil Taylor and Brian Robertson, except where indicated. \n\nDisc one \t\n\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Back at the Funny Farm&quot;   \t4:11\n2. \t&quot;Shine&quot;   \t3:08\n3. \t&quot;Dancing on Your Grave&quot;   \t4:26\n4. \t&quot;Rock It&quot;   \t3:52\n5. \t&quot;One Track Mind&quot;   \t5:52\n6. \t&quot;Another Perfect Day&quot;   \t5:26\n7. \t&quot;Marching Off to War&quot;   \t4:09\n8. \t&quot;I Got Mine&quot;   \t5:21\n9. \t&quot;Tales of Glory&quot;   \t2:53\n10. \t&quot;Die You Bastard!&quot;   \t4:22\n11. \t&quot;Turn You Round Again&quot; (B-Side of I Got Mine) \t3:55\n\nDisc two \t\n\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Back at the Funny Farm&quot; (live) \t  \t4:06\n2. \t&quot;Tales of Glory&quot; (live) \t  \t3:40\n3. \t&quot;Heart of Stone&quot; (live) \tClarke, Kilmister, Taylor \t3:11\n4. \t&quot;Shoot You in the Back&quot; (live) \tClarke, Kilmister, Taylor \t2:43\n5. \t&quot;Marching off to War&quot; (live) \t  \t4:48\n6. \t&quot;Iron Horse/Born to Lose&quot; (live) \tTaylor, Mick Brown, Guy Lawrence \t3:45\n7. \t&quot;Another Perfect Day&quot; (live) \t  \t5:38\n8. \t&quot;(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man&quot; (live) \tDixon \t6:39\n9. \t&quot;(Don't Need) Religion&quot; (live) \tClarke, Kilmister, Taylor \t2:43\n10. \t&quot;One Track Mind&quot; (live) \t  \t6:12\n11. \t&quot;Go to Hell&quot; (live) \tClarke, Kilmister, Taylor \t2:59\n12. \t&quot;America&quot; (live) \tClarke, Kilmister, Taylor \t4:25\n13. \t&quot;Shine&quot; (live) \t  \t3:08\n14. \t&quot;Dancing on Your Grave&quot; (live) \t  \t5:42\n15. \t&quot;Rock It&quot; (live) \t  \t4:38\n16. \t&quot;I Got Mine&quot; (live) \t  \t5:36\n17. \t&quot;Bite the Bullet&quot; (live) \tClarke, Kilmister, Taylor \t1:34\n18. \t&quot;The Chase Is Better Than the Catch&quot; (live) \tClarke, Kilmister, Taylor \t5:42\n\n\nBand members\n\n    Lemmy (Ian Kilmister) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, vocals\n    Brian &quot;Robbo&quot; Robertson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar, piano on &quot;Rock It&quot;, Fender piano on &quot;Shine&quot; and backing vocals on &quot;Back at the Funny Farm&quot;\n    Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\nThis was my introduction to Motorhead it became one of my favorites, and it only took 20-30 years for everyone else to.
