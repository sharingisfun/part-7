Burn with imgburn or use a USB flash drive. \n                   \n2. Install using your own key or \n   use some of the Activates/patch out there.\n\n3. Have fun =) \n  \n\n\nI make this release so peoble can repurpose an old system that can't run the latest, or for anyone to use for the purposes of learning and \nexperimentation.\n\nI make them for people who like to have \nupdated versions of windows for when they install/re-install.\n\nA lot of malware can be blocked by simply updating your system. \nSome malware goes undetected and goes to town on your system if you don't update your files.\n\nAnd because not everyone has fast internet like me, i have very slow.\n\nIt would be best if microsoft did new version, \nin any case, if they release an updated version of windows when they stop support, like xp.\nIt would be great.\n\nLike this:\nWindows XP Service Pack 4\nWindows XP Pro x64 Service Pack 3\nWindows Vista service Pack 3\n                   \n&quot;If anyone is willing to donate $ or parts please PM me.&quot; \n\n\nThis is my last En-US (english) release.
