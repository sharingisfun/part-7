Tracy is Frank Skeffington, the political boss of an Eastern city dominated by Irish-Americans. Skeffington tries to assist the people of the city and avoids cutting political deals with the power elite. But despite his concern for the people, Skeffington has no friends, just flunkies. The Mayor is greatly admired by his idealistic nephew Adam Caulfield (Jeffrey Hunter), who writes for an opposition newspaper run by Amos Force (John Carradine). When Skeffington needs money for a loan, he asks the powerful banker Norman Cass (Basil Rathbone), but Cass steadfastly refuses. In retaliation, Skeffington appoints Cass's retarded son as an interim fire commissioner. To prevent his son from disgracing the family, Cass agrees to the bank loan. But Cass uses his deep pockets to finance the opposition's candidate for mayor.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : The Last Hurrah.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.41 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 661 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Bit rate : 1 396 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 368 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.235\n      Stream size : 1.18 GiB (84%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 256 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 222 MiB (15%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nIMDB: tt0051845","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d7b11ae5324149d10b52b5fdc6106de502f2ea6","amp;dn":"John+Ford+-+The+Last+Hurrah+%5B1958%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d7b11ae5324149d10b52b5fdc6106de502f2ea6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,123,17,174,83,36,20,157,16,181,43,95,220,97,6,222,80,47,46,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
