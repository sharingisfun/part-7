Well, it's not really lost,&quot; drummer Stephen Morris said in a statement. &quot;I remember that Martin Hannett once had an idea of making a record and burying it in his garden, so that one day someone would dig it up, like a time capsule. We just stuck our record in a cupboard. And now we've got it out&quot;.\n \n&quot;When we did the first one ['Waiting For The Sirens Call'] we had 20 ideas for songs - we were going through a particularly prolific phase - but we couldn't make a double concept album out of them all, so we thought we'd just do two instead,&quot; he added.\n \nHe continued: &quot;The intention was always to write four or five more songs and then put it out 18 months or so after the first one. When we unearthed it from the cupboard recently, with the intention of re-editing some of the songs, we all agreed they didn't actually need it, and it should just be out there. So here it is&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1cba7ef9e39c870db0f1e78e0b0c86fb2eb2d29","amp;dn":"NEW+ORDER+-+Lost+Sirens+%28+EP+%29+2013++MP3++WEB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1cba7ef9e39c870db0f1e78e0b0c86fb2eb2d29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,203,167,239,158,57,200,112,219,15,30,120,224,176,200,111,178,235,45,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
