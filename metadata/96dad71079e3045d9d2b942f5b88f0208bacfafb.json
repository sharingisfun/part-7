I resized it with Any Video Converter and played it on my HDTV. I could not tell the difference from the large file. The sound is not great, but it wasn't very good on the original, and I could detect no difference there either. It's B&amp;W and working from an old print it just didn't require a high resolution. You can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear, as the saying goes.\n\nThis Blue Ray rip has some restored scenes not on the DVD rip and that is why I decided to share this. I felt that a more reasonable size would encourage those who are reluctant to download a very large file. This is a film worth seeing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96dad71079e3045d9d2b942f5b88f0208bacfafb","amp;dn":"Mr.Hulots.Holiday.1953.resized-CiNEFiLE_xvid.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96dad71079e3045d9d2b942f5b88f0208bacfafb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,218,215,16,121,227,4,93,157,43,148,47,91,136,240,32,139,172,250,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
