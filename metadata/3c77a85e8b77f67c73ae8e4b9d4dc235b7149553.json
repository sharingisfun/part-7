So, the Closer Camera means the camera view is closer to Aidens\nback/shoulder, Far camera means it is further away so you see more of Aidens body and Normal Camera is the normal default view.\nChoose the folder that matches the camera view you want. \nInside you will find 2 files - patch.dat and patch.fat  \nCopy and Paste these two files into the folder called data_win64 that is in your Watch Dogs install directory. For example C:ProgramFilesUbisoftWATCH_DOGS or whereever you have the game installed on your computer. So to clarify, the 2 files need to go into the data_win64 folder. You will notice there are many .dat and .fat files already in there from when the game was installed. \n(Optional step) TheWorse designed this mod with the Ultra setting in mind to recreate the visuals from what was seen at E3 2012. \nTo recreate this quality of graphics, the Ultra setting is recommended. \n\nIt should be noted that many - if not all - of his mods will still work in the other graphics settings too, eg, Low, Medium and High. These 'overall' graphics settings of Low, Medium, High and Ultra is the first option in the Advanced Graphic Settings in the Main Menu in Watch Dogs.\n\nNote: Back up ur save games and both of these just in case any error occurs....\nI tested it with the normal camera and the graphics drastically changed especially at night time of the game and it's performance didn't go down as well........\n\nENJOY....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c77a85e8b77f67c73ae8e4b9d4dc235b7149553","amp;dn":"Watch+dogs+E3+PC+Original+Graphics+enabler+Mod+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c77a85e8b77f67c73ae8e4b9d4dc235b7149553","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,119,168,94,139,119,246,124,115,174,142,75,157,77,194,53,183,20,149,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
