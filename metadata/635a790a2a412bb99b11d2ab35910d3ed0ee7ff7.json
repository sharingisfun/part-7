Producer Creed Taylor was obviously striking while the iron was hot, getting in as many Brazilian sessions as he could, yet the quality of the music-making remained consistently marvelous. Continuing his practice of running through one star guitarist after another, this time Getz has Laurindo Almeida as the designated rhythm man, featured composer, and solo foil. The rhythm section is an authentically swinging mixture of American sidemen (including Steve Kuhn on piano and George Duvivier on bass) and Brazilian percussionists. Almeida didn't like to improvise, so his solos stay close to the tunes, inflected with a perfectly matched feeling for the groove along with classical poise. Jobim's &quot;Outra Vez&quot; is a particularly lovely example of Getz's freedom and effortless lyricism contrasted against Almeida's anchored embroidering. Sessions like these might have been seen as cashing in on the boom at the time, yet in the long view, one should be thankful that these musicians were recording so much cherishable material.\n\n\nSTAN GETZ\nwith Guest Artist LAURINDO ALMEIDA     1963\n\n- CD\n- 320Kbps\n\nRecorded at Webster Hall, NYC on March 21st and 22nd , 1963 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:635a790a2a412bb99b11d2ab35910d3ed0ee7ff7","amp;dn":"Stan+Getz+with+Guest+Artist+Laurindo+Almeida+-+1963+-+320Kbps+%23+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"635a790a2a412bb99b11d2ab35910d3ed0ee7ff7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,90,121,10,42,65,43,185,155,17,210,171,53,145,13,62,208,238,127,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
