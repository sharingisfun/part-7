Had the Cold War developed into a more serious conflict, the Su-25 would have been the main Soviet combat type facing US aircraft.Today it is widely accepted as the true successor to the types of specialized ground--attack aircraft that emerged during World War II. The book details the service history of the 'Frogfoot' during more than 30 years of combat using first-hand accounts and revealing archive photographs. The Su-25 has often been underrated, but the faithful 'Frogfoot' is now slated to remain in service with most of its current operators across the globe until at least 2020. \n\nThis study explores the successes of the Su-25 in full, demonstrating its' strengths as a formidably armed, armored and very agile attack aircraft.\n\n\nBook Cover: https://img.bi/#/t5JRdwO!SyXozgkprTlw-2mhXAVcT6pgSckpyARe-dpAShSr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aed6473573f398a49e3f5f72260816124d0b5fb","amp;dn":"Su-25+%27Frogfoot%27+Units+In+Combat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aed6473573f398a49e3f5f72260816124d0b5fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,237,100,115,87,63,57,138,73,227,245,247,34,96,129,97,36,208,181,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
