As with other Traffic albums, The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys featured different forms and offshoots of rock including jazz rock, progressive rock, as well as classic rock and roll. The title of the album was suggested by the actor Michael J. Pollard.\n\nThe album features the hit &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Stew (part 1)&quot; and the FM hit, &quot;The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys.&quot; This is the only original Traffic album to feature two lead vocals by Jim Capaldi (&quot;Light Up Or Leave Me Alone&quot; and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Stew&quot;). His only other unaccompanied vocal on a Traffic studio album was &quot;Dealer&quot; from Mr. Fantasy. The LP is also notable for its striking die-cut cover.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3] [2008 Japanese SHM-CD]\n\n    &quot;Hidden Treasure&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:16\n    &quot;The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 12:10\n    &quot;Light Up or Leave Me Alone&quot; (Jim Capaldi) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:55\n    &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Stew&quot; (Ric Grech, Jim Gordon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:29\n    &quot;Many a Mile to Freedom&quot; (Steve Winwood, Anna Capaldi[4]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:26\n    &quot;Rainmaker&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:39\n\n  Bonus \n\n    &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Stew Parts 1 &amp; 2&quot; (Grech, Gordon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:07\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c84b4459ed785eeab22499ff12ec538b4202e450","amp;dn":"Traffic+-+Low+Spark+Of+High-Heeled+Boys+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c84b4459ed785eeab22499ff12ec538b4202e450","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,75,68,89,237,120,94,234,178,36,153,255,18,236,83,139,66,2,228,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
