The international sex trade criss-crosses the entire globe, a sinister network made up of criminal masterminds, local handlers, corrupt policemen, willfully blind politicians, eager consumers, and countless hapless women and children. In this ground-breaking work of investigative reporting, the celebrated journalist Lydia Cacho follows the trail of the traffickers and their victims from Mexico to Turkey, Thailand to Iraq, Georgia to the UK, to expose the trade's hidden links with the tourist industry, internet pornography, drugs and arms smuggling, the selling of body organs, money laundering, and even terrorism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83ce984782f8ad707d177d0fd63790406867b5c0","amp;dn":"Slavery+Inc%3A+The+Untold+Story+of+International+Sex+Trafficking","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83ce984782f8ad707d177d0fd63790406867b5c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,206,152,71,130,248,173,112,125,23,125,15,214,55,144,64,104,103,181,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
