However, several conflicting sources have stated that they formed in early 1979[3][4][5][6]. Founding members Jaz Coleman (vocals, keyboards) and Geordie Walker (guitars) have been the only constant members.\n\nA key influence on industrial rock,[7] their early music was described by critics Stephen Thomas Erlewine and John Dougan[8] as &quot;quasi-metal ... dancing to a tune of doom and gloom,&quot; which gradually evolved over the years, incorporating elements of dance music, world music, gothic rock, though always emphasizing Coleman's &quot;savagely strident vocals.&quot;[7]\n\nFinding modest commercial success, Killing Joke have influenced many later bands, such as Nirvana, Ministry, Amen, Nine Inch Nails, Napalm Death, Amebix, Big Black, Godflesh, Tool, Prong, Metallica, Primus, Jane's Addiction, Soundgarden, Foo Fighters, Faith No More, Shihad and Korn, all of whom have at some point cited some debt of gratitude to Killing Joke\nTRACK LIST\n01 Requiem.mp3                                          \n02 Wardance.mp3                                         \n03 Tomorrow's World.mp3                               \n04 Bloodsport.mp3                                      \n05 The Wait.mp3                                         \n06 Complications.mp3                                   \n07 SO36.mp3                                            \n08 Primitive.mp3                                        \n09 Change.mp3                                           \n10 Requiem (single version).mp3                         \n11 Change (dub - previously unreleased).mp3             \n12 Primitive (rough mix - previously unreleased).m      \n13 Bloodsport (rough mix - previously unreleased).  \n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c416eff8617fae77b1463fa93c65f577fde559ab","amp;dn":"Killing+Joke-KILLING+JOKE%281980%29-SiLvErDuSt%40SHAREGO-320+KBPS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c416eff8617fae77b1463fa93c65f577fde559ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,22,239,248,97,127,174,119,177,70,63,169,60,101,245,119,253,229,89,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
