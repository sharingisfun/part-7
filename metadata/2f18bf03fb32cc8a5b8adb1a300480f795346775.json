Which isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t to say the band doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t drift along on some pleasingly spacy atmospheres conjured by longtime producer Brian Eno: thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still a veneer of classy disaffection that inevitably dissipates due to the relentless sunniness of Chris Martin and company. Eno's echoes and ambience -- the only things that still mark Coldplay as anything resembling progressive -- positively sparkle when they meet the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bright, chipper melodies, yet Coldplay's innate good manners restrain the album, keeping it just this side of a rush of candied pop. Such politeness can verge on the dull -- criminally so when they bring Rihanna in for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Princess of China,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a duet so toothless she may as well have stayed home -- but Mylo Xyloto has a leg up on other Coldplay records for this simple reason: theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re no longer attempting to mimic U2's portentous piety. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve embraced their schoolboy selves and are simply singing songs of love and good cheer, albeit on a grand scale that somehow seems smaller due to the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s insuppressible niceness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f18bf03fb32cc8a5b8adb1a300480f795346775","amp;dn":"Coldplay+-+Mylo+Xyloto+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f18bf03fb32cc8a5b8adb1a300480f795346775","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,24,191,3,251,50,204,138,91,138,219,26,48,4,128,247,149,52,103,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
