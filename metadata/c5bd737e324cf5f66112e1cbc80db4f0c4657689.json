Go for it! :D\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThis is the first book that presents a comprehensive introduction to and overview of electro-magnetic tissue property imaging techniques using MRI, focusing on Magnetic Resonance Electrical Impedance Tomography (MREIT), Electrical Properties Tomography (EPT) and Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM). The contrast information from these novel imaging modalities is unique since there is currently no other method to reconstruct high-resolution images of the electro-magnetic tissue properties including electrical conductivity, permittivity, and magnetic susceptibility. These three imaging modalities are based on Maxwell's equations and MRI data acquisition techniques. They are expanding MRI's ability to provide new contrast information on tissue structures and functions.\nTo facilitate further technical progress, the book provides in-depth descriptions of the most updated research outcomes, including underlying physics, mathematical theories and models, measurement techniques, computation issues, and other challenging problems.\n\nReadership: Researchers, academics and graduate students in medical imaging, computational mathematics and biomedical imaging.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5bd737e324cf5f66112e1cbc80db4f0c4657689","amp;dn":"Electro-Magnetic+Tissue+Properties+MRI+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5bd737e324cf5f66112e1cbc80db4f0c4657689","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,189,115,126,50,76,245,246,97,18,225,203,200,13,180,240,196,101,118,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
