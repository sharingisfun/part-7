The protagonist is Joe \nChip, a debt-ridden technician for Glen Runciter's &quot;prudence organization&quot;, \nwhich employs people with the ability to block certain psychic powers (as in \nthe case of an anti-telepath, who can prevent a telepath from reading a \nclient's mind) to enforce privacy by request. Runciter runs the company with \nthe assistance of his deceased wife Ella, who is kept in a state of &quot;half-life&quot;, a \nform of cryonic suspension that gives the deceased person limited \nconsciousness and communication ability.\n\nWhen business magnate Stanton Mick hires RunciterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s company to secure his \nlunar facilities from telepaths, Runciter assembles a dozen agents for this \ntask. The group includes Pat Conley, a mysterious young woman who has an \nunprecedented parapsychological ability to undo events by changing the \npast. Joe Chip is shown at several points to have sexual feelings for the \ndefiant Pat Conley, who once gives the impression of reciprocating them.\n\nWhen Runciter, Chip, and the others reach MickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moon base, they discover \nthat the assignment is a trap, presumably set by business rival Ray Hollis. A \nbomb explosion apparently kills Runciter without significantly harming the \nothers. They rush back to Earth to place him in half-life.\n\nAfterwards, the group begins to experience strange shifts in reality. \nConsumables, such as milk and cigarettes, begin to deteriorate prematurely. \nAlso, the group sees Runciter's face on coins and receives strange messages \nfrom him in writing and on television. Most of these messages imply that \nRunciter is in fact alive, while the others are in half-life, or &quot;cold-pac&quot; as it is \ninformally called. Group members who separate from the group are found \ndead, in a gruesome state of decomposition.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNote: Except for a modification of the file names, this is a verbatim repost of files\nposted in this group in 2009. I finished listening to Ubik 2 weeks ago, and enjoyed it.\nIt's more cerebral from your standard airport novel.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97767027040dc00ce5a081f69385f44e8c73a281","amp;dn":"Philip+K+Dick+-+Ubik","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97767027040dc00ce5a081f69385f44e8c73a281","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,118,112,39,4,13,192,12,229,160,129,246,147,133,244,78,140,115,162,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
