Right-clicking the alert clears it.\n    Sparkles will shoot up whenever a resource node is discovered from the fog of war. (#historicallyaccurate)\n    updated commodity icons from commodity edb (+ added grenade launcher icon, finally)\n\nFarming:\n\n    FIXED: crops destroyed by fishpeople will clear up their squares with parent farm now (were stuck flagged as occupied before)\n    Giant farming overhaul performed!\n    crops require tending at various stages of growth, or theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll spoil\n    spoiled crops must be cleared before they can be replanted\n    added some new crop art assets\n    farms are smarter about their jobs (will keep harvest jobs in the farm zone assignment rather than giving them to everyone, etc)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Å“till soilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ now has some sfx and pfx\n    adjusted colour of cabbage sprouts\n    up-sized pumpkin plants\n\nFishpeople:\n\n    added Fishpeople diversity (they now come in different colours)\n    Fishpeople attack event added (the event popup is just to alert the player, fishpeople are spawned regardless of whether they read the event); Lots of things make fishpeople angry, and if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re angry enough they will attack you. The more anger, the more attackers.\n    when a Fishperson is shot, he or she will interrupt his or her current activity &amp; make him or her angry and attack land-humans in a larger radius than before\n    Fishpeople will spawn along the shore nears their eggs, not anywhere on the map\n    harvesting caviar will cause more Fishpeople attack events\n\nCharacters / Memories:\n\n    Removed a few recursive emotions/memories (E.g. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I felt angry recently. THIS MAKES ME ANGRYÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½)\n    Poets will occasionally read their poetry to others. Decent poetry will make people feel tranquil. Decent poetry is relatively rare.\n    New Ã¢â‚¬Å“feeling angryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ emote animation replacing the old one. The old one will eventually be put back in as a reaction to conversation.\n    FIXED: Drinking. Drinking booze will (generally) settle down strong emotions but cause tiredness. More effects to come.\n    FIXED: interrupted drinking will no longer semi-permanently attach whisky bottles to peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s backs (Drinks drop properly when drinker is interrupted, tools are stowed properly.)\n    FIXED: Characters should always, always have 3 traits now\n    People now correctly pick up, drop corpses for burial.\n    A huge number of jobs are now more or less desirable based on character traits. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see how much insanity this causes.\n    Inspecting machinery job now plays an animation.\n    Various new memories added to characters\n\nNature Harvesting:\n\n    various nature harvestable cleanups performed:\n    &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Clear SaplingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Clear StumpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are uniquely named jobs now (for the click &amp; drag orders)\n    &gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Clear ObjectÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ job generally renamed to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Clear TerrainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n    &gt; jobs set via click &amp; drag wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t perform viral propagation\n    random foragable dropped airship crates are scattered on map\n\nStockpiles:\n\n    Stockpile edge pieces now in place.\n    added a small Ã¢â‚¬ËœwanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to end of stockpile return jobs so people wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stockpile themselves in neat rows\n\nWorkshops:\n\n    Workshop jobs no longer reorder themselves in the menu. Jobs at the top of the queue are prioritized, but if they cannot be done, the work crew will attempt to perform subsequent jobs until they find one that can be completed.\n    Workshop jobs no longer temporarily appear and disappear from the Jobs tab. They will now only appear when the job can actually be performed.\n    added a cheaper, less effective Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stone OvenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the kitchen. It is built with stone blocks.\n    Ã¢â‚¬Å“standing deskÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ module is optional for all workshops\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26f8e51dc2a9a2cea9d0716a633786a8cecb2a87","amp;dn":"Clockwork+Empires+Build+30","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26f8e51dc2a9a2cea9d0716a633786a8cecb2a87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,248,229,29,194,169,162,206,169,208,113,106,99,55,134,168,206,203,42,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
