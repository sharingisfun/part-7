They possessed extraordinary features: forebrains roughly 50% larger than ours, and estimated IQs to match--far surpassing our own. Many of these huge fossil skulls have been discovered over the last century, but most of us have never heard of this scientific marvel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c171657c3915f1e14349838b07392fa29720dd14","amp;dn":"Big+Brain%3A+The+Origins+and+Future+of+Human+Intelligence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c171657c3915f1e14349838b07392fa29720dd14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,113,101,124,57,21,241,225,67,73,131,139,7,57,47,162,151,32,221,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
