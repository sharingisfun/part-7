The resulting 2-disc recording from this fertile developmental period ably demonstrates the remarkably creative path Carlos Santana took to inevitable fame. Utilizing a line-up that included Gregg Rolie, vocals and keyboards, David Brown, bass, Doc Livingston, drums and Marcus Malone, congas, the band's sound was a tasty gumbo of rhythm and passion.\n\nAs evidenced in their set list, Santana's influences at this time included master African percussionist Babatunde Olatunki (&quot;Jingo&quot;), jazz musician Chico Hamilton (&quot;Conquistadores Rides Again&quot;) and Albert King (&quot;As The Years Go Passing By&quot;). Grooves were the name of the game, and the chemistry between Rolie and Carlos Santana was at the core of these performances, whether its the give-and-take improvising going on between the two in &quot;Fried Neckbone&quot; or the slow, after-hours jazz vibe Rolie lays down at the beginning of &quot;Treat,&quot; which ends up morphing into a Latin-flavored rock number. A fascinating live document showcasing the embryonic stages of Santana's trademark improvisational talents.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1\n01.
