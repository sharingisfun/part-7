Karris, &quot;Digital Circuit Analysis and Design with an Introduction to CPLDs and FPGAs&quot;\nOrchard Publications | 2005-01-01 | ISBN: 0974423955 | 448 pages | PDF\n\n\nThis book is an undergraduate level textbook presenting a thorough discussion of state-of-the-art\ndigital devices and circuits. It is self-contained; begins with the basics and ends with the latest developments of\nthe digital technology. The intent is to prepare the reader for advanced digital circuit design and\nprogramming the powerful Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs), and Field\nProgrammable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).\nThe prerequisites for this text are just basic high-school math; Accordingly, it can be read and\nunderstood by high-school seniors, trade-school, community college, and 4-year university\nstudents. It is ideal for self-study.\nThe author and contributors make no claim to originality of content or of treatment, but have\ntaken care to present definitions, statements of physical laws, theorems, and problems...
