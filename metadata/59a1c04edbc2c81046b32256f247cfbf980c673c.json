His wife Fran (Ruth Chatterton) is obsessed with the notion that she's growing old, and she eventually persuades Sam to sell his interest in the company and take her to Europe. He agrees for the sake of their marriage, but before long Fran has begun to think of herself as a cosmopolitan sophisticate and thinks of Sam as dull and unadventurous. Craving excitement, Fran begins spending her time with other men and eventually informs Sam that she's leaving him for a minor member of royalty. While in Italy, Sam runs into Edith Cortright (Mary Astor), an attractive widow whom he first met while sailing to Europe. Edith seems to understand Sam in a way his wife does not, and they fall in love. However, Sam impulsively breaks off their relationship, only to discover in her absence just how deeply he cares for her. Dodsworth was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Walter Huston), and Best Supporting Actress (Maria Ouspenskaya), though only art director Richard Day walked away with an Oscar. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Dodsworth.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.12 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 40mn\n      Bit rate : 1583 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 8.91 MiB\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 40mn\n      Bit rate : 1450 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 464 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.379\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.202\n      StreamSize : 1.02 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 40mn\n      Bit rate : 126 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 91.3 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : CBR\n\nIMDB: tt0027532\n\nEnglish audio; English, French, Spanish and Poruguese subpack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59a1c04edbc2c81046b32256f247cfbf980c673c","amp;dn":"Dodsworth+%281936%29+-+William+Wyler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59a1c04edbc2c81046b32256f247cfbf980c673c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,161,192,78,219,194,200,16,70,179,34,86,242,71,207,191,152,12,103,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
