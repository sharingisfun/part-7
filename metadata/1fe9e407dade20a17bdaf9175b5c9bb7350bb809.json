Following in the footsteps of the Edwardian publishing sensation - the JK Rowling of her day - Patricia discovers what fired Beatrix's imagination and where her love and understanding of animals was born. As an actress, Patricia played Beatrix on stage in the 1990s. In her present role as patron of the Beatrix Potter Society, and with access to rare drawings, letters and artefacts held at the V&amp;A Archive, Patricia discovers the woman behind the myth and reveals what led her to write and illustrate her 23 tales filled with animal characters featuring human habits and emotions. Patricia reveals how a letter written to an ill little boy became Peter Rabbit, and what led to the creation of magical and enduring characters like Jemima Puddleduck, Tom Kitten and Jeremy Fisher.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 19 (~1204Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1024x576\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.48 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 46 min\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 448 MB\r\nSource: PDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fe9e407dade20a17bdaf9175b5c9bb7350bb809","amp;dn":"Ch4+Beatrix+Potter+with+Patricia+Routledge+PDTV+x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fe9e407dade20a17bdaf9175b5c9bb7350bb809","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,233,228,7,218,222,32,161,123,218,249,23,91,92,155,183,53,11,184,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
