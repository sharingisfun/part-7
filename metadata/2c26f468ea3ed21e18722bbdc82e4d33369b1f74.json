After all, my grandma had just died and I wanted to take care of my aging grandpa -- he couldn't be a farmer in Wyoming forever. And graduating from Eagle Elite meant opportunity.\nBut I wasn't counting on meeting Nixon.\n\nNor was I counting on the rules of the Elect.\n\nDo not touch The Elect.\nDo not look at The Elect.\nDo not speak to The Elect.\nAnd worst of all? Don't discover the secret they hide, because in the end, you may just realize... it's about you.\n\nThis is a New Adult Book, blood, violence, cursing, sexual references, and drug use. Not recommended for those under 17.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c26f468ea3ed21e18722bbdc82e4d33369b1f74","amp;dn":"Elite+%28Eagle+Elite+%231%29+by+Rachel+van+Dyken+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c26f468ea3ed21e18722bbdc82e4d33369b1f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,38,244,104,234,62,210,30,24,114,43,189,200,46,77,51,54,155,31,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
