Based on real characters and events, this haunting drama focuses on the personal sacrifice of a Prague history student, Jan Palach, who set himself on fire in protest against the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1969. Dagmar BuresovÃƒÂ¡, a young female lawyer, became part of his legacy by defending Jan's family in a trial against the communist government, a regime which tried to dishonour Palach's sacrifice, a heroic action for the freedom of Czechoslovakia. \n\nWritten by HBO Europe \n\n\n--\nUnfortunately I haven't found subtitles for this series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0e8df537f97c94f10124f9e1603c5848accd93a","amp;dn":"Ho%C5%99%26iacute%3Bc%26iacute%3B+ke%C5%99+%28Burning+Bush%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0e8df537f97c94f10124f9e1603c5848accd93a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,232,223,83,127,151,201,79,16,18,79,158,22,3,197,132,138,204,217,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
