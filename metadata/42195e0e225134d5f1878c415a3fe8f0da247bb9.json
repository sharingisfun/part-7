I spent all last week grabbing comedy albums which I am now going to upload here. Other than going to the trouble of fixing tags and getting artwork and details, these torrents are as the original posters seeded them. I am not endorsing or recommending all of these. In fact, I think some of them suck. However, there is a major lack of well seeded comedy torrents here, and I hope to encourage more people to post new ones. Also, who says *MY* taste matches somebody elses? The reviews are from ALLMUSIC or from AMAZON. As usual, much thanks to the Ops who put these out and about.\n\nRambam1776\n\n\nTODD BARRY - FALLING OFF THE BONE\n\nBiography\tby David Jeffries\nFinding it hard to apply his B.A. in English to his previous jobs ? VD clinic clerk and drummer ? the deadpan, sometimes doe-eyed Todd Barry accepted his fate and turned to standup comedy in 1987. Bronx born and bred, Barry grew up a fan of Steve Martin, George Carlin, and Andy Kaufman. After spending years touring the comedy clubs, a 1998 Jury Award for Best Stand Up Comic at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen welcomed him to the big leagues. After an April 1999 appearance on Late Night with Conan O&amp;#039;Brien, Barry took to the Internet newsgroup &quot;alt.fan.conan-obrien&quot; only to find one of the group&amp;#039;s regulars describing him as &quot;worst guest of the week&quot; and &quot;icky.&quot; Rankled, Barry created the one-man show Icky, which featured instrumental music from Yo La Tengo and had a successful run at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater. The television special Comedy Central Presents: Todd Barry also appeared in 1999. In 2001 he made his debut on CD with the self-released Medium Energy. After comedian David Cross declared it one of his favorite CDs, the Sub Pop label picked up the album for distribution in 2004. That same year, Comedy Central Records issued the CD/DVD combo Falling off the Bone and a year later reissued Medium Energy. From Heaven appeared in 2007. \n\nBarry was Entertainment Weekly&amp;#039;s 2003 &quot;It Standup&quot; selection on their &quot;It List&quot;. He&amp;#039;s appeared on Letterman, Conan O&amp;#039;Brien, Carson Daly, Comedy Central&amp;#039;s Friar&amp;#039;s Roast of Chevy Chase, &quot;Space Ghost Coast To Coast&quot;, and in his own &quot;Comedy Central Presents&quot; special. His acting credits include &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, &quot;Sex And The City&quot;, &quot;Spin City&quot;, &quot;Chappelle&amp;#039;s Show&quot;, &quot;Road Trip&quot; and &quot;Pootie Tang&quot;. He&amp;#039;s done cartoon voice work on &quot;Dr. Katz&quot;, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Home Movies&quot;, and &quot;Hey Monie&quot;. Todd has even opened for Yo La Tengo, The Shins, They Might Be Giants, and Luna. At the US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, he won the Jury Award for Best Stand Up Comic. This is his sophomore release, following his self-released &quot;Medium Energy&quot;. Forty-five minutes of new material recorded live at Pianos in Manhattan&amp;#039;s Lower East Side. The DVD compiles his best Comedy Central performances, including his highly rated &quot;Comedy Central Presents&quot;.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:j9fuxqusldte&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:j9fuxqusldte&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42195e0e225134d5f1878c415a3fe8f0da247bb9","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Todd+Barry+-+Falling+off+the+Bone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42195e0e225134d5f1878c415a3fe8f0da247bb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,25,94,14,34,81,52,213,241,135,140,65,90,63,232,240,218,36,123,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
