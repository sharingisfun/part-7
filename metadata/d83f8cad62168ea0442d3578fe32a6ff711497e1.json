I have also uploaded T-Men by the same pair.\n\nRaw Deal stars Dennis O'Keefe, Claire Trevor, and Marsha Hunt. There are also memorable bits by Raymond Burr and Whit Bissell.\n\nAnother beautifully photographed, sublime noir by one of the best pairs in noir: Mann and Alton. The final scene with O'Keefe and Raymond Burr is memorable. The coffee toss by Burr earlier in the film has an analog in The Big Heat (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3819292/The_Big_Heat__(1953)_Fritz_Lang), another noir starring Glen Ford and Gloria Grahme. Lee Marvin does the coffee toss in that one. Worth a look.\n\n*******************\n\nPlease seed at least 1:1, a bit more if you can. Thank you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d83f8cad62168ea0442d3578fe32a6ff711497e1","amp;dn":"Raw+Deal+%281948+film+noir%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d83f8cad62168ea0442d3578fe32a6ff711497e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,63,140,173,98,22,142,160,68,45,53,120,254,50,166,255,113,20,151,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
