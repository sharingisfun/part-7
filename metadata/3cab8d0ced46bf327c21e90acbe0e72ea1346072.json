At first things look good, Stone sees Merriam as a younger version of himself and Merriam sees Stone as the first adult to ever treat him as a friend. But after a couple strange deaths of crew members, Merriam begins to think Stone is a psychopathic madman obsessed with authority. He tries to tell others, but no one believes him, and it only makes Stone angry.\n\nDirector: Mark Robson\nWriters: Donald Henderson Clarke (screenplay), Leo Mittler (story)\nStars: Richard Dix, Russell Wade, Edith Barrett\nLenght: 69 minutes\n\nQuality: DVD Rip\nContainer: MKV\nVideo Codec: AVC/H264/MPEG4\nVideo Bitrate: 1850 Kbps\nAudio Codec: AC3 1 ch\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps\nResolution: 720 x 540\nFull Screen (4x3)\nFrame Rate: 23.976 FPS\nSize: 1,00 Gb\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img844/967/yvgb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img844/967/yvgb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img691/7135/8wom.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img691/7135/8wom.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cab8d0ced46bf327c21e90acbe0e72ea1346072","amp;dn":"The+Ghost+Ship+%28Mark+Robson%2C+1943%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cab8d0ced46bf327c21e90acbe0e72ea1346072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,171,141,12,237,70,191,50,124,33,233,10,203,224,231,46,161,52,96,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
