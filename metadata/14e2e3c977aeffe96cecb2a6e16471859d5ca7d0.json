The first half contains some of Soft Cell's best songs, and the second half of the album is Marc Almond's solo work. Many of the songs are remixes, but a casual fan won't care as they are very similar to the originals. Standout tracks include &quot;Torch,&quot; &quot;Tears Run Rings,&quot; and &quot;Something's Gotten Hold of my Heart&quot; (a duet with Gene Pitney) and a very good remix of &quot;Memorabilia&quot; (much better than the original). \nThe big disappointment of this collection is that it skips his 3 solo albums: Vermin In Ermine, Stories of Johnny, Mother Fist and her Five Daughters, and his two Mambas releases: Untitled and Torment and Toreros..\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Memorabilia ['91]\t\t\t- Soft Cell\n[02] Tainted Love\t\t\t\t- Soft Cell\n[03] Bedsitter\t\t\t\t- Soft Cell\n[04] Torch\t\t\t\t- Soft Cell\n[05] What?\t\t\t\t- Soft Cell\n[06] Say Hello Wave Goodbye ['91]\t\t- Soft Cell\n[07] Soul Inside\t\t\t\t- Soft Cell\n[08] Where The Heart Is\t\t\t- Soft Cell\n[09] I Feel Love\t\t\t\t- Bronski Beat Featuring Marc Almond\n[10] Tears Run Rings\t\t\t- Marc Almond\n[11] A Lover Spurned\t\t\t- Marc Almond\n[12] Something's Gotten Hold Of My Heart\t- Marc Almond Featuring Gene Pitney\n[13] Say Hello Wave Goodbye\t\t\t- Soft Cell [12&quot; The long goodbye)\n[14] Waifs And Strays \t\t\t- Marc Almond [Grid Twilight mix]\n \n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:09m:19s\n\nTotal Folder File Size\t- 164mb (Including mp3, Art Covers &amp; Booklet, word doc)\n\nTotal Mp3 Bit Rate \t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop Runk\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nOriginally Released\t- 08 October 1991\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Phonogram\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.marcalmond.co.uk \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  - Too Many Pages To Check * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14e2e3c977aeffe96cecb2a6e16471859d5ca7d0","amp;dn":"%5B1991%5D+Memorabilia+The+Singles+-+Soft+Cell+%26+Marc+Almond+%40320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14e2e3c977aeffe96cecb2a6e16471859d5ca7d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,226,227,201,119,174,255,233,108,236,178,166,225,100,113,133,157,92,167,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
