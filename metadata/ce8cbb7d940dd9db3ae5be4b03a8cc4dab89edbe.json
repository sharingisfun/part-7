Mount the .iso file in Daemon tools or something OR burn it out with Nero etc\n2. Open the CD and install it\n\nIf you are going to use DOSBox:\n1. Download DOSBox from http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/ and install it (DOSBox is also  available for Linux)\n2.Mount the .iso file in Daemon tools or something OR burn it out with Nero etc\n3. Start dosbox, and press CTRL+F12 to get some extra speed (dont take to much if you have an older computer)\n4. Mount the cd inside dosbox and install it\n5. Enjoy! Remember, mount the cdrom with the -t cdrom switch, or else the game wont find the CD\n\nTo install this game, you maybe need some DOS experience!!! But if you want to play this, you have probably used DOS....\n\n\nPlease seed the torrent after downloading!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce8cbb7d940dd9db3ae5be4b03a8cc4dab89edbe","amp;dn":"Fragile+Allegiance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce8cbb7d940dd9db3ae5be4b03a8cc4dab89edbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,140,187,125,148,13,217,219,58,229,190,75,3,168,204,77,171,137,237,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
