Questions that will profoundly impact the way we think about disease, about longevity, and about free will. Questions that will affect the rest of your life.\nGenome offers extraordinary insight into the ramifications of this incredible breakthrough. By picking one newly discovered gene from each pair of chromosomes and telling its story, Matt Ridley recounts the history of our species and its ancestors from the dawn of life to the brink of future medicine. From Huntington's disease to cancer, from the applications of gene therapy to the horrors of eugenics, Matt Ridley probes the scientific, philosophical, and moral issues arising as a result of the mapping of the genome. It will help you understand what this scientific milestone means for you, for your children, and for humankind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a22b13dea737aba292e721451b538f41f544a75","amp;dn":"Genome%3A+The+Autobiography+of+a+Species+in+23+Chapters+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a22b13dea737aba292e721451b538f41f544a75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,34,177,61,234,115,122,186,41,46,114,20,81,181,56,244,31,84,74,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
